02-1472 +++$+++ 4 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: These two contract cases concern whether the Government is liable in money damages under the Contract Disputes Act and section 110 of the Indian Self-Determination Act when the Secretary fails to fully pay a contract price for the --
02-1472 +++$+++ 5 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would you mind explaining to us how these two cases relate? The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision went one way and the Tenth Circuit went another. And are the claims at all overlapping? How are they differentiated?
02-1472 +++$+++ 6 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice O'Connor. They're -- they're not overlapping. The claims in the Federal Circuit case involved three contracts covering fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996. And the Cherokee contract at issue in the case that went through the Tenth Circuit is fiscal year 1997 contract and funding agreement. The section -- remedial section of the act, section 110 --
02-1472 +++$+++ 7 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But they're certainly at odds on the legal theory.
02-1472 +++$+++ 8 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, they are, Your Honor. The Federal Circuit applied standard, bedrock Government contracting law, primarily the rule that when a contract payment is conditioned on there being an appropriation, the payment right vests in full once the appropriation is enacted by Congress. And secondly, the court ruled that the Indian Self-Determination Act does not bar the payment of the contracts in this case under the circumstances presented. And to the contrary. We submit that the Secretary's construction of that clause would undo the act, would undo section 106(b) of the act --
02-1472 +++$+++ 9 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are the circumstances any different in the two situations, the Cherokee Nation case and the one in the Federal Circuit? Are -- are the circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any respect that could account for a difference in outcome?
02-1472 +++$+++ 10 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice O'Connor. There -- there is no difference in that respect, and there is an overlap in -- in this sense. The Shoshone-Paiute contract that arose through the Tenth Circuit case did involve fiscal year 1996, the same fiscal year as the Cherokee contract that covered fiscal year 1996. So in that sense, both cases involved the -- the same relevant issues. The -- the key, we think, to the resolution of the act is found in the act on page 12a of the appendix to our opening blue brief. The act was amended in this section twice, in 1988 and in 1994, for three reasons: to secure contract funding, to reduce the Federal bureaucracy, and to eliminate secretarial funding discretion over contract funding issues. In section 12a, 450j-1(a), the bottom half of the page, it is stated in subparagraph (1) that the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall not be less than the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided. And then directly pertinent to this case is subparagraph (2), which directs -- which addresses contract support costs. There shall be added to the amount required by paragraph (1) contract support costs which shall consist of certain items. Incidentally, these items typically cover the cost of insurance, audit costs, procurement costs that might otherwise be administered for the Government by the Office of Personnel Management or personnel costs that might otherwise be administered by the Office of Personnel Management.
02-1472 +++$+++ 11 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does the -- do the actual contracts reduce the -- the CSC's to a dollar amount or --
02-1472 +++$+++ 12 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, they do.
02-1472 +++$+++ 13 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so we know -- they -- they knew at the moment the contract was signed what it was going to cost.
02-1472 +++$+++ 14 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct, Justice Souter. In the case of the Shoshone-Paiute contract, when the parties decided to renegotiate the contract amount, they entered into an amendment to specify the new, updated contract amount.
02-1472 +++$+++ 15 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't want to get ahead of you in taking us through the statute, so you can defer the question if -- if you choose. But it seems to me relevant to (a). Does -- is -- is part of the submission that the Government used some of the funds that otherwise would have gone to you for its own monitoring and -- of -- of health contracts and that that's what's in dispute? Or was it just general overhead for other programs it used?
02-1472 +++$+++ 16 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it is precisely, Justice Kennedy, what -- what you stated. In fact, we can turn directly to page 14a --
02-1472 +++$+++ 17 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I stated an or. I -- what I -- I stated at the outset?
02-1472 +++$+++ 18 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the Government took money for its own Federal functions instead of -- including contract monitoring --
02-1472 +++$+++ 19 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Including contract monitoring.
02-1472 +++$+++ 20 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Including contract monitoring. Including contract monitoring. In fact, they say so in their brief and -- and defend that action. The -- the sections on page 12a and 13a articulate in quite a lot of detail the nature of the contract support costs that must be added.
02-1472 +++$+++ 21 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ These are strange contracts, of course, aren't they? I mean, are there any other contracts that the Government has to enter into? I mean, the Secretary has to give these tribes the authority to take over, in effect, implementation of the -- of a Federal health program, doesn't he?
02-1472 +++$+++ 22 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct, Justice Scalia.
02-1472 +++$+++ 23 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- why would you expect that this strange kind of contract should -- should, prima facie, be governed by the same rules as to appropriations as other contracts --
02-1472 +++$+++ 24 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because --
02-1472 +++$+++ 25 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- where -- where an agency, having due regard to how much money is appropriated, will limit the number of contracts it enters into? But -- but here you're creating a situation where the agency has to contract and yet has no control over having enough money to -- to meet the contractual obligations. It seems to me a -- a strange way to run a railroad.
02-1472 +++$+++ 26 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it is a unique contractual situation, Justice Scalia, but one that Congress fully anticipated. And -- and I would explain it this way. First of all, there is the Contract Disputes Act which Congress said applies to these contracts. The contracts were so unique that prior to 1988, the Interior Board of Contract Appeals, in a decision called the Busby case, had ruled that these contracts could not be enforced under the Contract Disputes Act precisely for the reason Justice Scalia articulated. Congress changed that. In 1988, Congress amended section 110 of the act, reproduced at the bottom of page 26a, and gave the Court of Claims, then the Court of Claims, and the district courts concurrent jurisdiction over money damages claims under the Contract Disputes Act. And the legislative history explains that Congress did this precisely to overcome the Busby decision and to make these contracts enforceable for the stated contract price.
02-1472 +++$+++ 27 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But further to Justice Scalia's point, don't the contracts in question themselves contain clauses that say this is not a procurement contract?
02-1472 +++$+++ 28 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the procurement contract -- that is correct. Not the contracts themselves, Your Honor. The -- the act says that --
02-1472 +++$+++ 29 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, the act says that they're not procurement contracts.
02-1472 +++$+++ 30 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the contracts are not procurement contracts, Justice Kennedy. That's correct. These contracts began as procurement contracts. They had been procurement contracts, and even still, they were not enforced under the Court of -- the Interior Board of Contract Appeals decision in the Busby decision. Congress relieved the contractors of the procurement system because they felt that the agency had built up an enormous contract monitoring bureaucracy which it wanted to eliminate. And for that reason, it eliminated the procurement rules in the hopes that the contract monitoring bureaucracy would be eliminated along with it.
02-1472 +++$+++ 31 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Miller, do --
02-1472 +++$+++ 32 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg.
02-1472 +++$+++ 33 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- on -- on the interpretation you've just explained to us, does that mean that the Secretary has no authority under this statute or generally to reserve some portion of this for what you call Federal functions, that it -- every penny of the appropriation could go to the costs of this contract and nothing left in the till for the so-called Federal functions?
02-1472 +++$+++ 34 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I -- I would put my answer in this context. There are many sources from which the Government could have reprogrammed to pay these contracts. It could have been, yes, as we submit, from the funds spent on Federal functions and secretarial administration. It could have been from the up to $88 million increases Congress was making every year. It could have been from the up to $98 million in leftover appropriations the agencies had every year, and it could have been from the regional and headquarters offices that the agencies had where they don't administer services.
02-1472 +++$+++ 35 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But your -- your answer is, yes, if it came to that, they --
02-1472 +++$+++ 36 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the duty Congress imposed upon the Secretary. The Secretary was free not to reprogram. That's -- that's a choice the Secretary had and the Secretary made it. The question is what are the ramifications of that choice and we submit --
02-1472 +++$+++ 37 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, let me ask you another question related. Suppose -- this is an individual action. These are individual actions. They're not class actions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 38 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct, Your Honor.
02-1472 +++$+++ 39 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do the ones who come to court to sue get paid in full even though there may be many other self-determination contracts out there, and that if you gave them all their fair share, none of them would be paid in full? Does it just depend on first come to court, first served, and the less litigious are just out of luck?
02-1472 +++$+++ 40 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, we -- we do not believe that that -- that should be the outcome. That would advantage the contractors that came forward and not take account of the entire situation. We think the global situation has to be looked at. The total amount of the contracts that were not paid in fiscal year 1994 --
02-1472 +++$+++ 41 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, you can't get blood out of a turnip. I mean, Justice Ginsburg is asking the question, what if there is not enough money to go around?
02-1472 +++$+++ 42 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If there were only sufficient money to pay half of the contract shortfalls --
02-1472 +++$+++ 43 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
02-1472 +++$+++ 44 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- without violating the clause and the Secretary had the discretion not to reduce appropriations, or he could, for programs serving other tribes, and then the tribes would only be entitled to half of the shortfall, if there was only a sufficient amount of money.
02-1472 +++$+++ 45 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Didn't the tribes get notice they might not get the full amount of the -- the CSC, and so they had ample opportunity to cut back on their spending?
02-1472 +++$+++ 46 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Kennedy, and -- and to the contrary. In fiscal year 1994, the Indian Health Service was telling everybody they were paying them in full. They told the General Accounting Office they paid everybody in full on page 32 of the GAO report cited in the Government's brief. But --
02-1472 +++$+++ 47 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So these -- these are reliance damages in a sense.
02-1472 +++$+++ 48 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the tribes expected to be paid. The Shoshone-Paiute tribes were told they would be paid in full in the first year.
02-1472 +++$+++ 49 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, they -- they were out of pocket for money they spent before they knew, other than the statutory notice they had, that they wouldn't get the full amount?
02-1472 +++$+++ 50 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct. That is correct.
02-1472 +++$+++ 51 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, when do the tribal contractors know how much money the Government actually will have available to spend?
02-1472 +++$+++ 52 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The contractors don't know until the year is over because throughout the year, the Government reserves the power, although not exercised, but stated in a circular, to reprogram. And the appropriations --
02-1472 +++$+++ 53 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what do you mean by that? You said a second ago the Secretary had the option to reprogram. What do you mean by reprogram?
02-1472 +++$+++ 54 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ When the Secretary prepares a budget to the Congress, it states usually a lump sum amount of, say, $1.8 billion. We -- we take $400 million off the top or $300 million off the top because that was specified by Congress for certain purposes. But the balance is a lump sum. The Secretary crafts a budget. The budget is not adopted by Congress, just a dollar amount is adopted by Congress. Now, Congress can step in and take a particular item and earmark that item and cap it if it chooses, but it didn't do that in these years.
02-1472 +++$+++ 55 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but the -- the tribes have to enter contracts not knowing how much money is going to be there at the end of the day?
02-1472 +++$+++ 56 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The tribes enter into contracts, as most Government contractors do when they enter into contracts before an appropriation is made, not knowing if the agency will have the money to pay them. That's okay. The problem is when the statute says it's subject to the availability of appropriations and Congress enacts the appropriations. It's been the law for 120 years that at that point, the right to payment vests and the tribe is entitled to be paid.
02-1472 +++$+++ 57 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. So how was that appropriation money in fact used by the Federal Government, do you say?
02-1472 +++$+++ 58 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Federal Government --
02-1472 +++$+++ 59 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There was the appropriation.
02-1472 +++$+++ 60 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 61 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the tribes had already entered into contracts. Now, how was that lump sum used?
02-1472 +++$+++ 62 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The agency then, under this Court's teaching in Lincoln v. Vigil, has complete discretion over how it spends its appropriation except insofar as --
02-1472 +++$+++ 63 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that what you mean by programming?
02-1472 +++$+++ 64 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, thank you, Justice Souter, for taking me back to your question. What we mean is that the Secretary submits a budget, but the budget is not binding on the Secretary. It's not binding as a matter of law because Congress didn't adopt it. And as conditions change over the course of the year, the agency readjusts its budget, which we call reprogramming.
02-1472 +++$+++ 65 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So programming is allocating various segments of the lump sum to various purposes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 66 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct.
02-1472 +++$+++ 67 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
02-1472 +++$+++ 68 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the Secretary retains complete discretion as this Court taught --
02-1472 +++$+++ 69 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And is that done without regard to the contract amounts that the tribes have entered into?
02-1472 +++$+++ 70 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it should not be done without regard to the contract amounts --
02-1472 +++$+++ 71 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that in fact how it was done?
02-1472 +++$+++ 72 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is in fact how it was done.
02-1472 +++$+++ 73 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And is it still done that way?
02-1472 +++$+++ 74 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the times have changed. Since 1998, fiscal year 1998, Congress has imposed caps on the contracts and court costs that the agency has. So there's no question the agency cannot pay more than Congress gives it. When Congress only gives it $100 million or $200 million for contract support costs, that's it. The Secretary cannot be sued for failing to pay more.
02-1472 +++$+++ 75 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But didn't -- didn't Congress, even before that, impose a significant limitation on how much the Secretary could pay? What do you with the provision in -- in (b) of -- of the section that you were reading from? Notwithstanding any other provision in this subchapter, the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and the Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe or tribal organization under this chapter. I mean, what -- what money that the Secretary expends is -- is not expended for programs, projects, or activities that serve a tribe?
02-1472 +++$+++ 76 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, we read this -- this clause with -- keeping in mind the first sentence first of the sentence. The first sentence, which begins on the preceding page, page 14a, says that the amount of funds required by subsection (a), (1) shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract monitoring or administration by the Secretary. And the subparagraph (3) in the middle of page 15a, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 77 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's all very good, but --
02-1472 +++$+++ 78 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But then there's an exception.
02-1472 +++$+++ 79 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- then the last paragraph begins with the word notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter. So this --
02-1472 +++$+++ 80 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We --
02-1472 +++$+++ 81 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- it seems to me, overrides everything else. Unless -- unless you can persuade me that that -- that that provision doesn't give the Secretary the authority to -- to allocate the available funds among other activities that serve tribes, I -- I think it trumps whatever else you appeal to.
02-1472 +++$+++ 82 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, for -- for two reasons we think it cannot. First of all, if that exception swallowed up the rule set forth in the first sentence, it would defeat the whole purpose of the act. And more, in the statute on page 21, there is a mandatory rule of construction that Congress has articulated which, interestingly enough, the Government never cites in the statutory interpretation case. And this rule says on page 21, 1(a)(2), each provision of the act --
02-1472 +++$+++ 83 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wait.
02-1472 +++$+++ 84 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Page -- sorry --
02-1472 +++$+++ 85 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 21 of --
02-1472 +++$+++ 86 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 21a of our opening blue brief.
02-1472 +++$+++ 87 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, 21a, good.
02-1472 +++$+++ 88 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 21a, correct. Each provision of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act and each provision of this contract shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the contractor. That statement is repeated as well in every --
02-1472 +++$+++ 89 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, fine, but you still have to look at that last sentence in subsection (b) and grapple with what it means. The Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe.
02-1472 +++$+++ 90 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So what could it mean? That's our challenge.
02-1472 +++$+++ 91 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, what does it mean?
02-1472 +++$+++ 92 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We have to give it meaning. We believe it means the -- as the Secretary always said when -- and -- and said at the time these amendments were adopted in 1988, that's services on the ground, the hospitals and clinics. If I walked into the office of the headquarters of the Indian Health Service in Rockville, Maryland, I'm not going to see doctors and nurses in white jackets. I'm not going to see patients and counselors. There aren't programs serving tribes in these headquarters offices, and in these area offices, large portions of what they do are administrative functions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 93 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. May -- may I interrupt you there? And tell me if I understand the -- the position in your brief correctly. I thought the position that you took there was ultimately regardless of what the notwithstanding clause means, there's enough money to pay all the contracts in the appropriation that is actually made. And if any money is going to be squeezed, the person who's going to be squeezed or the -- is the -- is the agency itself. Its bureaucracy is going to have less money. And I understood your argument to be that given the provisions you read earlier in this section, Congress has made a positive decision that if there's a choice between paying the contract amounts and squeezing the bureaucracy, the bureaucracy gets squeezed. Is that your position?
02-1472 +++$+++ 94 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is our position.
02-1472 +++$+++ 95 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If that is your position, do you have to even grapple with difficulties about the notwithstanding clause?
02-1472 +++$+++ 96 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we still need to provide some meaning to the -- to the provision that says the Secretary may not -- does not have to reduce funding for programs serving other tribes. I guess, I think we do need to grapple with the clause in order not to --
02-1472 +++$+++ 97 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but I thought you were saying you could -- you could -- the -- the Secretary doesn't have to reduce funding for other tribes. The Secretary can pay the full contract costs, and if anybody is going to get the short end, it's going to be the bureaucracy.
02-1472 +++$+++ 98 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's going to be the bureaucracy.
02-1472 +++$+++ 99 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Just give them the -- just give them the money.
02-1472 +++$+++ 100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's not going to be the programs on the ground serving the tribes. It's going to be the bureaucracy.
02-1472 +++$+++ 101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
02-1472 +++$+++ 102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, it may be felt --
02-1472 +++$+++ 103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To put it -- this is a competition between two bureaucracies, the tribal bureaucracy that is administering the program and the Secretary's bureaucracy which is administering the program of programs. I mean, it's -- it's not as though it's a bureaucracy against the people. The whole purpose of this was to turn over the bureaucratic management of these programs from Government bureaucrats to tribal bureaucrats. I mean, it --
02-1472 +++$+++ 104 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I would -- I would --
02-1472 +++$+++ 105 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- you -- you paint it as though the -- you know, who cares about the bureaucrats. The -- the Government just wasn't interested in the bureaucrats. That may well be, but there -- there are bureaucrats at both ends of this thing.
02-1472 +++$+++ 106 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I say that for two reasons. First of all, the -- the Congress, in our opinion, clearly privileged the tribal contracts over the Secretary's Federal functions. But more practically, let's look at the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. They took over a hospital that had a $5 million budget in round numbers, and the contract support costs requirement was $2 million. So the contract was in round numbers $7 million. So they get the hospital, $5 million to run it. They don't get the $2 million. Now, they have $3 million to run the hospital. It's not that they didn't get their bureaucracy. They didn't get the full hospital operational budget because they had to pay the fixed costs of carrying insurance, undertaking the audits required by Federal law. There were actual reductions in services so severe, in fact, that the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe nearly lost accreditation.
02-1472 +++$+++ 107 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can I ask you a basic question --
02-1472 +++$+++ 108 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Breyer.
02-1472 +++$+++ 109 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- which maybe others understand, but I'm confused. Imagine that this has nothing to do with Indians. It is simply an ordinary contract. Now, my understanding is that ordinary contracts say subject to appropriations. So we have to decide was there an appropriation. In our imaginary department of Government, the appropriation is $1 billion. Nothing is earmarked for anything. They enter into contracts that amount to $999 million. Now, they pay out $990 million, and their -- what the department says is, look, everybody knows we need at least $10 million to run our central bureaucracy. So there's no valid contract here. The appropriation wasn't made. Now, my understanding of ordinary Government contract law is to decide whether that $10 million was in principle available for the contracts. You look to something called the purpose-time-amount test. So was it during the same time? Yes. Is it in an appropriate amount? Yes. But is it available for this purpose? Ah, I'm not sure. All right. Now, I want -- if I have the -- the theory of it right, I want you to tell me what the money was in your case that is the equivalent of the $10 million in my example that you believe in principle was available to pay these -- for this Indian expenditure. Just pretend it's a regular contract. What is the equivalent of that $10 million?
02-1472 +++$+++ 110 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The equivalent of the $10 million would be sums not spent on anything --
02-1472 +++$+++ 111 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 112 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in this case, up to $100 million.
02-1472 +++$+++ 113 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, okay. And anything else?
02-1472 +++$+++ 114 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Any of the increases, any of the sums. And then we move to this statute --
02-1472 +++$+++ 115 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, forget this statute for a second because I'll stop you there. I want you to tell me why those sums -- I get the time. I get the amount.
02-1472 +++$+++ 116 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why the purpose.
02-1472 +++$+++ 117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Explain to me why it is one of the purposes for which those appropriations were made, i.e., the equivalent of the $10 million, to go pay for this.
02-1472 +++$+++ 118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's one of the things the -- the Government and we agree upon.
02-1472 +++$+++ 119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was one of the purposes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ One of the purposes was paying contracts, and that's because in this act, the appropriation says here's $1.4 billion or $1.8 billion to carry out the Indian Self-Determination Act. So that satisfies the purpose test.
02-1472 +++$+++ 121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. So you think -- you and the Government agree then that were this an ordinary contract case, there is no doubt that a legally binding contract would have been entered into and the clause, subject to appropriations, would not work for the Government.
02-1472 +++$+++ 122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct, Your Honor.
02-1472 +++$+++ 123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
02-1472 +++$+++ 124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you can't say that the Government agrees to that. You certainly agree to it.
02-1472 +++$+++ 125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. Were it an ordinary --
02-1472 +++$+++ 126 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Government --
02-1472 +++$+++ 127 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- were it an ordinary contract.
02-1472 +++$+++ 128 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In -- in the hypothetical. No. I think the Government would agree that the rule of Ferris and Blackhawk, the Dougherty rule from the Court of Claims, 1983, all stand for the proposition when you sign a contract with the Government and a lump sum appropriation comes, it's not your job to start monitoring Government operations and figuring out how much do they want to boost their functions for this or that or the other, and the --
02-1472 +++$+++ 129 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So our issue as far as you're concerned -- and I'll ask the Government the same question -- is, is this contract different from an ordinary contract because of A, B, C, D Indian reservations, et cetera? And your claim is, I can't find any difference. And their claim is there will be some difference. Is that right?
02-1472 +++$+++ 130 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct. They claim these aren't contracts -- Justice Kennedy.
02-1472 +++$+++ 131 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you did say the -- these contracts were unique.
02-1472 +++$+++ 132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ These contracts are unique. The contracts in Winstar were unique. The contracts in the United States v. New Mexico advance costs -- advance funded cost reimbursable contracts. Many contracts are unique. The question is whether the distinction makes a difference in the law. The distinction here that these are not procurement contracts, that can't be decisive.
02-1472 +++$+++ 133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the Government says it's unique because the tribes are providing governmental services. It doesn't really cite us a case where, say, a city or a subdivision has sued under a contract.
02-1472 +++$+++ 134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's not unique either because the -- the Government, the Department of Defense in Iraq contracts out governmental services, the provision of food to our troops in Iraq. That's a quintessential governmental services, feeding the military. But they contract it out. No one would suggest there that just because it's a governmental service, it qualifies that contract as a lesser contract than any other contract.
02-1472 +++$+++ 135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they didn't contract it out to the government of Iraq. They contracted it out to a private contractor. I mean, what -- what makes this unique is that the whole purpose of it was to give these -- these tribes more governmental power, more self-determination. The whole purpose was to enable the tribes to act as governments.
02-1472 +++$+++ 136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely. And even Congress considered --
02-1472 +++$+++ 137 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's -- that's what makes it different from private contracts --
02-1472 +++$+++ 138 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We --
02-1472 +++$+++ 139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- even -- even with Halliburton.
02-1472 +++$+++ 140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We --
02-1472 +++$+++ 141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, Halliburton is not an Indian tribe and doesn't purport to be governing anybody.
02-1472 +++$+++ 142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We submit that that difference was considered by Congress. In the 1988 amendments, there's even language that says, we're thinking about maybe calling this an intergovernmental agreement, but we've decided to call it a contract because we want it to be enforceable as a contract, just as other Government contracts for goods and services are enforced. And that was the language of the -- of the Senate report. They then imposed the Contract Disputes Act and provided a remedy in money damages. In those respects, along with the canon of construction, we believe that these contracts are fully enforceable for the stated contract amount. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, Justice Stevens.
02-1472 +++$+++ 143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. Mr. Srinivasan.
02-1472 +++$+++ 145 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Apart from the roughly 2 percent of the annual lump sum appropriation that the Secretary withheld for performance of those core agency functions that the agency itself was required to perform, the Secretary allocated the entire remaining 98 percent of its lump sum appropriation among tribes. Now, the tribes have to point to some source of funding within that lump sum appropriation.
02-1472 +++$+++ 146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they just did, the 2 percent. So my question to you is the same. I asked, let's imagine this had nothing to do with tribes, nothing to do with it. It was a typical, ordinary Government contract for pencils. All right? Or for soda water. Now, and everything were the same. Under those circumstances, just an ordinary contract -- and they point to that 2 percent and they say that is legally speaking -- we didn't expect you to pay it. We just won a lawsuit in the Court of Claims. But -- but we have -- we have a contract here. Okay? That's what we're just saying. The -- the subject to appropriation clause doesn't nix the contract because that 2 percent is available, legally speaking, time, purpose, and -- and amount. Okay? Classic. Now, what's the Government's view there?
02-1472 +++$+++ 147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
02-1472 +++$+++ 148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it available or not were this an ordinary contract?
02-1472 +++$+++ 149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. With respect to the 2 percent that's reserved for inherent Federal functions, that's not available.
02-1472 +++$+++ 150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm asking -- all right. Are -- is the Government's view then let's treat this just as an ordinary contract? Still it -- there was no money available.
02-1472 +++$+++ 151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With respect to --
02-1472 +++$+++ 152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Legally speaking under the time-purpose-amount test.
02-1472 +++$+++ 153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Breyer, I'm drawing a distinction between the 2 percent that's reserved for core agency functions and --
02-1472 +++$+++ 154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
02-1472 +++$+++ 155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- it's been a background principle of Government contracting law that there are certain core agency functions that -- that the Government is required to perform for itself and that it can't contract out. So I think that informs the interpretation of the subject to availability clause.
02-1472 +++$+++ 156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, I would like an answer to my question, yes or no. If this were an ordinary contract with a subject to appropriations clause, is -- would the Government be saying this is invalid because the appropriations were not there?
02-1472 +++$+++ 157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you have to look at the particular context.
02-1472 +++$+++ 158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There must be a yes or no answer to that.
02-1472 +++$+++ 159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It would be no if this statutory regime governed, Justice Breyer.
02-1472 +++$+++ 160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. What it is is a contract for pencils. Can you not -- is it impossible --
02-1472 +++$+++ 161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if all --
02-1472 +++$+++ 162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to make -- you see what I'm driving --
02-1472 +++$+++ 163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if all that's at issue is a standard subject to availability clause in a contract and there were no reduction clause, as there is in this statute, and you're dealing with the standard procurement context, then there is a Court of Claims decision, the Blackhawk decision, that suggests, albeit in a footnote, that in that situation, there are funds available in the sense that they're legally unrestricted.
02-1472 +++$+++ 164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct, and which are the funds that are -- that would be available here? Which are they?
02-1472 +++$+++ 165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There aren't any funds that are available here in our view because --
02-1472 +++$+++ 166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If this were under Blackhawk.
02-1472 +++$+++ 167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Under Blackhawk, it would be -- it would -- it would essentially affect the entire lump sum appropriation because there's no legal requirement that the lump sum appropriation be -- be directed in any particular manner. Now, there are some provisions in the --
02-1472 +++$+++ 168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That includes the 2 percent that you keep referring to.
02-1472 +++$+++ 169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- that would include in the -- that would include the 2 percent. But there are provisions, I should note parenthetically, in the appropriations act that say specifically, for example, that not to exceed a certain amount is to be used for a particular function or at least a certain amount is to be used, for example, for contract health services. So you'd have to take into account --
02-1472 +++$+++ 170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. Then let me do this then.
02-1472 +++$+++ 171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- those particular provisos.
02-1472 +++$+++ 172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You say if this were a classic, ordinary contract, the money would have been available legally speaking. Nobody says practically speaking, and they could have brought their lawsuit. Now, tell me specifically, if you can -- and this may take you the whole time. You want to make whatever argument you want. What is it that's special about this contract that brings it out of ordinary contracting principles?
02-1472 +++$+++ 173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, first and foremost, the text of the statute. If you look at page 15a of the appendix to -- to the tribes' briefs, this isn't your standard, garden variety subject to availability clause. You have to look at the particular context in which this statute --
02-1472 +++$+++ 174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the language is the same.
02-1472 +++$+++ 175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not, Justice O'Connor, with respect. It says, notwithstanding any other provision -- and I'm reading at the bottom of page 15a -- the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and -- and this is --
02-1472 +++$+++ 176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That phrase is the same, subject to the availability of appropriations.
02-1472 +++$+++ 177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That particular phrase resembles the one that Justice Breyer posited in his hypothetical.
02-1472 +++$+++ 178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Exactly.
02-1472 +++$+++ 179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the term available -- and I think this is critical. The term available is repeated in what's been referred to as the reduction clause, and I don't think one can understand what the term available means unless it considers the meaning of that term throughout that entire sentence.
02-1472 +++$+++ 180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but the other -- the other side says you don't have to get to that because you could have paid the contract amounts here without reducing funds available for other tribes. It's simply that it would have squeezed you in your budget, your -- your headquarters operating budget for IHS. So they say, if I understand them, that the -- that the nonreduction clause doesn't save you here because you could have paid it without reducing things for other tribes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I think that argument is incorrect. First of all, it's an incorrect interpretation of the terms of the reduction clause. But second of all, the notion that funds for inherent Federal functions, the 2 percent that the agency reserved to perform its core agency functions, were available for contracting is contrary to -- to the terms of the ISDA itself. And if you'll look at page 12a -- and I'm quoting from 450j-1(a)(1) -- what provision says is the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts include the amount that the Secretary, quote, would have otherwise provided. And then later on down in the paragraph --
02-1472 +++$+++ 182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't see that. Where?
02-1472 +++$+++ 183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. It's --
02-1472 +++$+++ 184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not less. Right?
02-1472 +++$+++ 185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Shall not -- shall be not less than the amount that the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided. And then further down in the paragraph in the last -- in the last clause, including support of administrative functions that are otherwise contractable. And what otherwise contractable denotes is that there are certain functions that are not otherwise contractable, namely those core, inherent Federal functions that the agency itself is required to provide. And so what 450j-1(a) implements is the background understanding that funds for core agency functions don't have to be turned over to the contracting tribes because the agency requires those funds in order to continue essentially to exist as a Federal agency.
02-1472 +++$+++ 186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but I thought the submission of the petitioners' counsel was that some of these funds were used to monitor the contracts which are functions the tribes could have performed. So is there a factual disagreement here?
02-1472 +++$+++ 187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so, Justice Kennedy. I think it's more of a characterization disagreement. There -- it's true that in a descriptive sense, one might refer to some of these funds as used for contract monitoring, but what 450j-1(a) says is that whatever you might call it, the funds that are used for core agency functions are outside the funds to be -- to be turned over.
02-1472 +++$+++ 188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't say that. It doesn't say that. What it says is otherwise contractable. And they could certainly -- for a lay person like me in this, you'd think, well, we could have a provision that says $180,000 is hereby authorized to be spent only for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or Secretary of Interior. Well, if it said that, then that's not otherwise contractable because there's a statutory limit.
02-1472 +++$+++ 189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but --
02-1472 +++$+++ 190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So otherwise contractable sounds like a -- a statutory question.
02-1472 +++$+++ 191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it -- it's not talking about money that's otherwise contractable. It says, including supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable. It's talking about a limitation upon the contractability of functions --
02-1472 +++$+++ 192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct.
02-1472 +++$+++ 193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- not the use of funds.
02-1472 +++$+++ 194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's talking about both because the -- the first part of subparagraph (1) is the amount of funds. It's relating to the amount of funds that are required to be transferred, and what it stands for is that funds for supportive administrative functions that are not otherwise contractable, i.e., those core agency functions that the agency is required to perform itself, those funds aren't required to be turned over to contracting tribes. And that just reflects the common sense principle that the agency has to continue to exist to perform some core functions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But how do you -- how do you square that with the -- on page 14a -- reductions and, as Mr. Miller read to us, shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract managing -- monitoring or administration by the Secretary, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions, including but not limited to, and then a string of what I assume falls under the heading Federal functions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the way we square that under the statute is that the leading -- the initial sentence in subsection (b) says the amount of funds required by subsection (a) of this section. And our view of the statute is that funds for inherent Federal functions were never required to be transferred under subsection (a) to begin with. And so what (b) deals with is the funds that are left over after the funds for inherent Federal functions are taken off the top.
02-1472 +++$+++ 197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So are these noninherent Federal functions shall not be reduced to pay for Federal functions? So there's inherent Federal functions and noninherent?
02-1472 +++$+++ 198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, absolutely there are. The Federal functions is the broader set of -- it could essentially encompass everything the Federal Government does. Inherent Federal functions refers to that core set of functions that the agency itself is required to perform. And the distinction between inherent Federal functions and Federal functions, although it might seem trivial as a semantic matter, is reflected in fact in the definitions in title V of the ISDA where it specifically defines inherent Federal functions as a subset of Federal functions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does it ever define them as noncontractable? I mean, I -- I -- your answer, I suppose, is well, what -- what do you think they're talking about, but does it ever expressly get to --
02-1472 +++$+++ 200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it does.
02-1472 +++$+++ 201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the point of contractability?
02-1472 +++$+++ 202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does, Justice Scalia -- Justice Souter. Excuse me.
02-1472 +++$+++ 203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, but apologize to him. (Laughter.)
02-1472 +++$+++ 204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And we describe the -- the relevant provision in our brief, if you'll bear with me for just one second, on page 31. When Congress enacted the title IV self-governance provisions that relate to the BIA -- and this is at the beginning of the first partial paragraph that begins with of particular significance. There's a provision there, 25 U.S.C. 458cc(k). And the provision reads that nothing in this section is intended or shall be construed to expand or alter existing statutory authorities so as to authorize the Secretary to enter into any agreement with respect to functions that are inherently Federal. And I think what that signifies is that there are some functions that are not contractable and can't be turned over to the tribes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- that all may be true, of course. They're talking about don't contract out to the Indians something that should be done in Washington. But what has that got to do with the issue? We're talking, I thought, about -- about Government contracts. People who enter into Government contracts need certainty. They have to know whether that word, subject to appropriations, invalidates the contract or whether they have a valid contract. And a set of principles have come up that are used to decide that. And under that set of principles, money is available to pay for the contract if it's time, purpose, and amount. Okay? That's the principle. And --
02-1472 +++$+++ 206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You don't think --
02-1472 +++$+++ 207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and I don't see anything contrary to that.
02-1472 +++$+++ 208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, one background principle -- and it's reflected, by the way, in the terms of the contracts themselves. One background principle is that funds for inherent Federal functions are not required to be transferred to tribes. And the contracts --
02-1472 +++$+++ 209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Mr. Srinivasan, do you say that the contracts that were entered into by IHS and the tribes did somehow contract away Federal -- inherent Federal functions?
02-1472 +++$+++ 210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. They specifically --
02-1472 +++$+++ 211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They didn't violate that section, did they? The contracts that we're talking about.
02-1472 +++$+++ 212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They specifically did not transfer --
02-1472 +++$+++ 213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. So we're not dealing with that. We're dealing with contracts that didn't violate that section. And you're just saying that some of the lump sum appropriation was diverted by the Government to pay for some kind of core Federal function, not that the contracts violated that provision.
02-1472 +++$+++ 214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. The -- that's correct, Justice O'Connor. What I'm responding to is the suggestion that funds that were allocated by the Secretary to pay for inherent Federal functions were required to be diverted to pay for the indirect costs --
02-1472 +++$+++ 215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're not saying -- you're addressing not what was contracted out, but what funds are available.
02-1472 +++$+++ 216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct.
02-1472 +++$+++ 217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's where your argument is going.
02-1472 +++$+++ 218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct. It relates to the funds that are available. And the tribes' position --
02-1472 +++$+++ 219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you rely on the statement in (a) that the -- the only funds that are available are funds that include funds to -- to pay for supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.
02-1472 +++$+++ 220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. Not funds --
02-1472 +++$+++ 221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And not funds that are used to pay for administrative functions that are not contractable.
02-1472 +++$+++ 222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. We think that funds for inherent Federal functions were taken off -- off the --
02-1472 +++$+++ 223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I --
02-1472 +++$+++ 224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You said that --
02-1472 +++$+++ 225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I ask you sort of a basic question that I'm having trouble following? As I understand, you're saying 98 percent of the appropriation have been allocated to programs, projects, activities, and so forth that can't be reduced. Now, is there anything in the statute that would have prevented the Secretary from allocating only 96 percent of the budget to those funds?
02-1472 +++$+++ 226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there is, Justice Stevens, in the following sense. It's not at all the case that the Secretary had unfettered discretion in composing the allocation scheme in any fiscal year.
02-1472 +++$+++ 227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But his budget that he actually worked out with the 98 percent was not mandated by the statute, as I understand.
02-1472 +++$+++ 228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In -- in part it was mandated by the statute.
02-1472 +++$+++ 229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In part but not in whole.
02-1472 +++$+++ 230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Perhaps not in whole --
02-1472 +++$+++ 231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's the point.
02-1472 +++$+++ 232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- but at least in significant part. And let me -- but I think this is significant, and if I can just walk the Court through the process by which the budget is developed and any appropriation ultimately is allocated. The Secretary has always, both before the ISDA and after the ISDA, taken the current year's allocation across programs as a given, as a baseline from which the next year's allocation will be built. And that's reflected in the terms of the statute on pages 14a to 15a of the appendix to the blue brief. There's a provision, 450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is the reduction in appropriations. But we're not dealing with that in the relevant fiscal years. There was always an increase. And so the Secretary, pursuant to the statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at the level that it was at the previous fiscal year. Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds two -- two considerations on top. The first is mandatory across-the-board increases for things such as salary COLA's and inflationary adjustments. And that's a standard feature of budgeting, and it's reflected again in the terms of the statute. And that -- I'd point the Court to page 9 of the Government's brief, the gray brief, where we cite a provision, 25 U.S.C. 1680a.
02-1472 +++$+++ 233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is the -- is the nub of what you're trying to tell me is that the 98 percent was, in fact, mandated by a statute?
02-1472 +++$+++ 234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was -- I -- I think in principal part it was mandated by the -- by --
02-1472 +++$+++ 235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Principal part, but --
02-1472 +++$+++ 236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let --
02-1472 +++$+++ 237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does that mean that there was not enough?
02-1472 +++$+++ 238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ At least as far --
02-1472 +++$+++ 239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They could have made it 97 percent --
02-1472 +++$+++ 240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- insofar as what I've said with respect --
02-1472 +++$+++ 241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and had enough money --
02-1472 +++$+++ 242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sorry.
02-1472 +++$+++ 243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to pay these contract obligations.
02-1472 +++$+++ 244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Justice Stevens.
02-1472 +++$+++ 245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ See, the thing that troubles me is it seems to me your reading of the statute makes the contractual problem -- provision illusory because they can always allocate funds to all these other projects and say, well, we've already used up the money.
02-1472 +++$+++ 246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I don't think that they have discretion to do that. And that's what I'm trying to explain. At least with respect to the existing baseline and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated by the statute that the -- that the Secretary conduct his budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done. With respect to the mandatory across-the-board increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U.S.C. 1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for, quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote, other expenses relating to the provision of health services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such funds are provided to programs and services operated directly. In other words, with respect to mandatory across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non-contracting tribes. And that leaves the additional set of an increase from one year to the next year that deals with specific targeted items, and principally that would include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come on board during the course of a particular fiscal year. And with respect to those specific targeted items, the critical point is that the contracting tribes often benefit from the addition of those and from the enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks. For example, in this particular case, the -- one of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic in Oklahoma. That was a new facility that came on board in the early 1990s and for which the -- for which the Cherokee Nation assumed administration of it through a self-determination agreement. Now, the staffing for that facility was specifically earmarked in the Secretary's budget submissions and in -- in Congress' appropriation committee reports. And it, of course, is in the Cherokee Nation's interest to ensure that those earmarks are honored.
02-1472 +++$+++ 247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are you telling me that the committee reports are -- are binding law?
02-1472 +++$+++ 248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're not binding law, Justice Stevens. We fully recognize that. But at the same time, I don't think that what Congress intended to do was to require the Secretary to completely ignore the committee reports.
02-1472 +++$+++ 249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. But you got a conflict apparently between the committee reports and what seems to be pretty clear law, which says we're going to treat these contracts as contracts, not as intergovernmental agreements. And in -- in that conflict, I don't see why contracting principles don't trump the committee reports.
02-1472 +++$+++ 250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not just the committee reports, Justice Souter. It's the reduction clause. The reduction clause is a part of the statute and no one has ever suggested the reduction clause doesn't inform the proper interpretation of the contract.
02-1472 +++$+++ 251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and their -- their argument is that you can pay the contract amount without robbing other tribes of the amounts that the -- that the nonreduction clause refers to. They are saying -- I think they're saying, look, you, the governmental bureaucracy, get squeezed. Yes. And if so, the contract comes first and you have to live with the squeeze and go back to Congress and say, we're doing what you told us and we're getting squeezed out of existence. I think that's what they're saying.
02-1472 +++$+++ 252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is what they're saying, Justice Souter, but with respect to, I think it's incorrect. The Government bureaucracy consists of two separate types of bureaucracy. There's that core bureaucracy that is the inherent Federal functions. And one of their arguments is that the Secretary was required to divest himself of the funds that were necessary to perform those functions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, he's not. But if -- if -- where I'm really coming from, to be honest -- and I'd like -- you might as well reply to what I'm actually -- is why I'm asking these slightly hostile questions. (Laughter.)
02-1472 +++$+++ 254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I read here -- look, the question really is was this money like the bureaucracy money. Is it legally speaking an appropriation available, not practically speaking but legally? And here it seems to me, in looking through this somewhat quickly, that you say no, but the Board of Contract Appeals say yes. And so I think in my mind, you know, one group of people who really know about this is the Board of Contract Appeals. So if they're saying that money from a contract point -- a point of normal contract law is legally available, I promise you I'm predisposed to think they're right. So I might as well expose that to you so you can tell me now why I'm wrong or they're wrong or whatever.
02-1472 +++$+++ 255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because, Justice Breyer, I think the core of it is that even if you think that they're right, that these funds are legally available, that's not enough under the ISDA because the ISDA specifically reserves to the Secretary the discretion that he not be required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make funds available to another tribe under this subchapter.
02-1472 +++$+++ 256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there is -- is -- the kind -- the money that's available to one tribe can't be taken for the other. But I thought the Board of Contract Appeals was saying taking that into account, there's still enough money left over. Am I wrong about that? I thought you should take money from one tribe to give it to another. What did they think?
02-1472 +++$+++ 257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. They thought -- the -- the board -- the Federal Circuit at least, which echoed the Board of Contract Appeals, thought --
02-1472 +++$+++ 258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm thinking the Board of Contract Appeals and the Federal Circuit.
02-1472 +++$+++ 259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think the Board of -- of Contract Appeals really wrestled directly with where the funds were coming from. They just thought that legal availability would be sufficient. Now, what the Federal Circuit said was that funds for inherent Federal functions are available. And we think that's wrong for the reasons I've said. I don't think those funds ever came into the group of funds that were subject to be transferred to begin with. But even if you thought that they did, I think it's clear that funds for inherent Federal functions are funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in the sense that one example of a core Federal function --
02-1472 +++$+++ 260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but if that's true, then everything -- then every penny in the -- in the IHS bureaucracy qualifies. I mean, that swallows the -- that swallows the entire budget.
02-1472 +++$+++ 261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let's -- Justice Souter, if I -- if I could, let's look at the particular sources --
02-1472 +++$+++ 262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. But I mean, just conceptually isn't that -- isn't that the -- the implication of what you're saying?
02-1472 +++$+++ 263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- you can't limit it to inherent Government functions. Both the inherent and the noninherent Government functions would fall within this provision --
02-1472 +++$+++ 264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- if you read it as broadly as you've just read it.
02-1472 +++$+++ 266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I guess the way I'd like to make the point is to say that the sources of funds that they point to, which include inherent Federal functions and the -- the noninherent Federal function bureaucracy that supports the administration of programs that serve tribes that are directly served by the Federal Government, those two are in fact programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe. With respect to the administrative support --
02-1472 +++$+++ 267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ On -- on that point -- on that point, in the Federal Circuit Judge Dyke expressed considerable displeasure with the Government because he said three times I said, tell me what existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced if these contract support costs are paid in full. And he said, I asked them again and again and again, and they were unresponsive. So since the Government declined to tell the court what programs -- existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced, mustn't we assume, as I think the Federal Circuit did, that the proof is unavailable and no existing program with other tribes would have been diminished?
02-1472 +++$+++ 268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't -- I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg. I mean, one straightforward reason why you don't have to take that assumption is that it's not only the Federal Circuit case that's before the Court, it's also the Tenth Circuit case. And there's -- there are declarations in the Tenth Circuit case that specifically assert that diverting funding for -- to pay for the contract support costs of these tribes would have required reducing funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe.
02-1472 +++$+++ 269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, what does that mean?
02-1472 +++$+++ 270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So --
02-1472 +++$+++ 271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, one thing is existing contracts, things that are already ongoing, and then another thing is, well, we think that there's a new program that could be good for some tribe. So we're going to put that new program in and say that that steps in front of these contract support costs. Are we talking just about existing programs that -- that the Government has made a commitment to, or are we saying the Government is at liberty to benefit tribes? And so what if the contract support costs are, as a result, diminished? We're still doing good for tribes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We're talking about both existing programs and new programs, and with respect to new programs, there's -- it's every bit as likely that those new programs would benefit contracting tribes as noncontracting tribes. And again, one of the new facilities --
02-1472 +++$+++ 273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's strange to talk of reducing -- is -- is not required to reduce funding for a new program. I mean, for a new program, there isn't any funding. How can you reduce the funding for a new program?
02-1472 +++$+++ 274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because --
02-1472 +++$+++ 275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That provision makes sense with regard to existing programs, but it doesn't make any sense with regard to proposed programs.
02-1472 +++$+++ 276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think that reduce necessarily takes the existing year's appropriation as the baseline. We think that what it takes as the baseline is the current year's appropriation allocation which takes into account increases. And one way to see that is 25 U.S.C. 1680a, which is the provision that I cited earlier that requires the Secretary to apportion mandatory across-the-board increases on a proportionate basis as between contracted programs and noncontracted programs. And what that provision means is that the reduction takes into account those mandatory across-the-board increases from year to year. So in some sense, I think reduce does mean this year's allocation of appropriations as opposed to last year's spending amount.
02-1472 +++$+++ 277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Srinivasan, you -- you alluded a moment ago in -- in answering Justice Ginsburg, I guess, to declarations on file on the Tenth Circuit case that -- that specifically said we would have to reduce funds available for other programs. Did those declarations get specific in the way that her original question was -- was asking about? Did it say -- did the declarations say we will have to reduce the X program for the Navajo Tribe and the Y program for the Apache Tribe and so on, or was it -- did the declarations simply say, as a general matter, we would have to reduce allocations for other tribes?
02-1472 +++$+++ 278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they -- they make the point as a general matter, and they also give an example. I think the one example that they give -- and maybe there are more -- is -- is a diabetes program. But I think it's more the general principle --
02-1472 +++$+++ 279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was that a new program or an existing program?
02-1472 +++$+++ 280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's an -- the -- the particular example is an existing program. But I think it's more --
02-1472 +++$+++ 281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me you can interpret those comments as saying we don't -- they did not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.
02-1472 +++$+++ 282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're -- you're speaking with particular respect to the new programs, Justice Stevens?
02-1472 +++$+++ 283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. It seems to me that you can interpret what you're saying as the -- as the -- the Government adopting a budget in which there's not enough room for all the programs it wants to support in the current year and continuing to honor the obligations under the existing contracts.
02-1472 +++$+++ 284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think that even with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract support costs. If you look at the figures, the shortfall in contract support costs, for example, in 1997 cumulatively was $82 million, and that's -- that is more than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996 to FY 1997. It's more than the amount that was reserved by the Government for inherent Federal functions. And so even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs.
02-1472 +++$+++ 285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there some way to avoid these problems now? Has anything changed?
02-1472 +++$+++ 286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice O'Connor, Congress changed things by imposing a statutory cap, explicit statutory cap, on contract support cost funding beginning with 1998. It had done so since 1994 for the BIA and it did so beginning in 1998 with respect to IHS.
02-1472 +++$+++ 287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why was there that difference between the BIA that got the statutory caps earlier and not till, was it, 4 years later for the IHS?
02-1472 +++$+++ 288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall. My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond. And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the two. But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act. And I think, if nothing else, section 314 at list -- at least expresses the view of a subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his discretion under the ISDA. And under this Court's decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997. So even if you thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA, I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation Act that its view was that Secretary had done so legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA. I want to address really quickly, if I could, the notion that the funds for administrative support for programs that are administered directly by the Federal Government are available. And that would have significant consequences because one of the policies underlying the act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that are currently entered into self-determination contracts, but it's to protect the amounts that are available to tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-determination contracts. And if, under the tribes' view, the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to -- to divert the entire amount of administrative support for -- for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years. Thank you.
02-1472 +++$+++ 289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Miller, you have about 4 minutes left.
02-1472 +++$+++ 291 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, thank you. First, I'd like to address the availability of appropriations clause briefly. That is a term of art with a well-established meaning. This Court in Morissette said that if -- unless there's a contrary direction from Congress that the term of art should not be given its well-established meaning, it controls. And that is the meaning, purpose, time, and amount, that the appropriation is available for the purpose during the time and in the amounts necessary to fully --
02-1472 +++$+++ 292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think they disagree with you about the purpose in respect to the core Government function.
02-1472 +++$+++ 293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Secondly, with regard to the core governmental functions, in Blackhawk, the contractor had a settlement with the Veterans Administration. The Veterans Administration had to reprogram. From where? We don't know, but the Veterans Administration had to reprogram and wanted to get approval from the Congress for that reprogramming action. Congress then stepped in but after the payment was due and forbade any reprogramming, and the Court then held when the payment was due, money was legally available and it doesn't matter where it comes from. There is no protection for inherent Federal functions. It may have come from some other hospital budget. It may have come from some other activity of the Veterans Administration. No doubt everything the VA does is important, but it doesn't mean it didn't have a legal obligation to pay the contract. There is no rule that has an IFF exception to the governmental duty to pay, and if there was, it would upset Government contract law deeply as the amicus brief from the National Chamber explains. Secondly, when funds are not available, we know what happens. This Court's decision, Justice Brandeis' decision for the Court, in Sutton explains what happens when funds are not available. There was a line item appropriation of $20,000 for a construction project. We understand that the contractor was on notice. Everything is square. Here, the entire lump sum appropriation was available, and I'd like to give the Court a sense of where the money could have come from, not that the Government had to do it. Just as in Blackhawk, if they chose not to reprogram, that's their right. But then there's a remedy. Where could the money have come from? In 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in a shortfall, just to the Cherokee contractor. No other contractor was apparently shorted. There was up to $98 million in leftover appropriations that year. There was 55 -- $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in increase every year from $36 million to $88 million. There was $25 million in inherent Federal functions. They couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this contractor? Not that they had to. They could have taken some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at headquarters and area offices. That was their decision. But the contractor didn't take the risk that the Secretary would say, at the end of the day, I've decided to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by golly, there's nothing left for you. No contractor takes that risk in dealing with the Government, and surely, a tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in the statute doesn't take that risk either. There is no limitation to the Secretary's theory in this case. The Secretary's theory means that we come, the contractors come, after the allocation of the Secretary. Well, the Secretary could, in a reduction year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the contracts and enhance even his own Federal bureaucracy and programs serving other tribes and say, now I've made my decision and I've made my judgment. I don't have enough money to pay you. There's no limit here on contract support costs. It could be the secretarial amount. They could zero out these contracts and say it's practical availability. And we've decided there isn't enough money to deal with all of the health care needs in the country, so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you come last. Now, that's not what the -- that's not what the statute permits. That sort of interpretation would lead to an absurdity. With regard to the Tenth Circuit decision, Justice, you asked a question about the declarations in the Tenth Circuit. There was a declaration in the Tenth Circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in programs serving other tribes. Now, that is not sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary judgment. So for all these reasons, we believe the Tenth Circuit decision should be reversed and the Federal Circuit decision affirmed. Unless the Court has more questions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Miller.
02-1472 +++$+++ 295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens.
02-1672 +++$+++ 299 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument in Jackson against the Birmingham Board of Education. Mr. Dellinger.
02-1672 +++$+++ 301 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Under the decision below, title IX stands alone as the only major civil rights statute that would permit retaliation against those who complain that the law is being violated. There are at least a half a dozen anti-discrimination laws that do not contain a separate retaliation provision, and every one of them has been found to prohibit retaliation as one kind of discrimination. There's a reason for that. Anti-discrimination laws simply can't be effective if threats of retaliation are allowed to chill those who would seek to bring their institutions into compliance.
02-1672 +++$+++ 302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, the question is whether -- that -- that may be true, but there would be an administrative remedy. The question here is a private cause of action for damages.
02-1672 +++$+++ 303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is true, Justice Kennedy.
02-1672 +++$+++ 304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Even -- even assuming the -- the validity of your premise, you still have another step.
02-1672 +++$+++ 305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand that other step, and I think that was largely resolved in Cannon v. the City of Chicago, a decision which this Court upheld a right of action to enforce title IX, even though there was also administrative remedies available and which was validated by Congress, as this Court -- every member of this Court recognized in -- in Sandoval.
02-1672 +++$+++ 306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought -- I thought that Cannon -- we've -- we've allowed Cannon to stay on the books, but I thought we have sworn off the kind of creation of -- of implied remedies that Cannon exemplifies.
02-1672 +++$+++ 307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In this case, there is no doubt that the two established principles together that are settled support this cause of action. The first is that there is a cause of action to enforce title IX. That's Cannon through Congress, through Sandoval, through -- your opinion in Sandoval acknowledges that Cannon is solid law and, the second point, that the statute itself is violated. Title IX is violated by retaliatory action against Coach Jackson. He's -- and -- and this is an important part of title IX because, particularly here, people like Coach Jackson need to come forward because students are often minors. They're not in the best position to know the budgets. It is people like Coach Jackson who make it work, and indeed, I think what is recognized about the -- about the cause of action for retaliation is that it is very important to enable people to bring their institutions into compliance without resorting to litigation.
02-1672 +++$+++ 308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's very -- it's very useful, I'm sure, but it -- it could be very disruptive also, I am sure. If I were -- if I were a coach, one of the first things -- especially a coach of a women's team in high school, one of the first things I would do would be to complain about not -- not getting enough facilities. This would make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether -- whether I'm a lousy coach or not. You -- you would have to think twice before you fire me because I would have a retaliation claim.
02-1672 +++$+++ 309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, the burden, of course, is on the plaintiff to demonstrate causation. And you should take great comfort from the fact, the Court can take great comfort from the fact that retaliation has been established as a violation of all of the major civil rights statutes, going back to 30 years to title VI --
02-1672 +++$+++ 310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Some of them specifically provide for retaliation, don't they?
02-1672 +++$+++ 311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct.
02-1672 +++$+++ 312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why do they do that if, as you assert, the mere word discrimination embraces it?
02-1672 +++$+++ 313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Congress has taken a different approach. In some cases, there would be a textual problem. Title VII, for example, speaks of discrimination based on such individual's race or national origin. Title -- and -- and therefore, it might need a specific retaliation provision. Title IX speaks upon -- about discrimination on the basis of sex. And here I think to -- to allay your concern about the coach, we have had -- title IX's retaliation provision has been the established law. It was the law at the time Congress -- it was understood, at the time Congress enacted title IX, that the identical wording of title VI had been construed by the administrative agency to include a cause of action for retaliation. Congress enacted title IX against the background of the Sullivan decision, which had recognized that discrimination can include retaliation. So that it comes as no surprise that every court of appeals that has addressed this issue has found that there's retaliation under title IX. In over 30 years, there -- at most we can find 140 reported cases in the Federal system where there is a claim for retaliation under title IX, and under title IX and all of the other discrimination provisions, courts have found it perfectly satisfactory to work out the causation requirements and -- in -- in dealing with retaliation cases. Now, here, what the respondent did is they discharged the coach who was seeking equal treatment for girls. When it singled Coach Jackson out for adverse treatment, it was discriminating, and when it did so, because he was seeking equal treatment for girls, it was discriminating on the basis of sex.
02-1672 +++$+++ 314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think that it -- it is a reasonable description of what happened -- he was fired for complaining about his girls' team not getting enough facilities -- that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded from participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under an education program?
02-1672 +++$+++ 315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
02-1672 +++$+++ 316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think that -- that remotely describes what happened to this coach?
02-1672 +++$+++ 317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely. First of all, the -- the court of appeals correctly says -- in the petition appendix at 3a, the court of appeals says we assume for the purposes of this appeal that the board retaliated against Jackson for complaining about perceived title IX violations. But for the discrimination on the basis of sex, he would not have complained, and he not -- had he not made a complaint about sex discrimination, he wouldn't have lost his position. He is denied the benefit of coaching in the program. He's denied the ability to participate in this federally funded program as a coach, and he is discriminated against by being singled out for retaliation. And this is not a case in which -- that has concern -- I mean, Justice Kennedy raised the question about this being a funding case, and I understand the special sensitivity that the Court has about rules that are based upon spending requirements where you want to be sure that States understand what they're agreeing to when they accept the Federal funds. This is not a case in which it could not have been anticipated when those funds were accepted. At that time, at the time these funds were accepted, which would have been about 1999 or 2000, title IX's ban on sex discrimination was itself, of course, universally known. Retaliation was understood to be part and parcel of that. We had had 30 years where both the Department of Education and --
02-1672 +++$+++ 318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but that's again the question of the substantive scope of the provision, and that's different from whether there was a congressional intent to create a private cause of action for this sort of violation. And was it -- Virginia Bankshares and so forth tells us that this is not the heyday of prior cause of actions anymore. You have to show that there's a congressional intent in the Spending Clause to create a private cause of action for damages.
02-1672 +++$+++ 319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think the Court --
02-1672 +++$+++ 320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that's -- that's quite separate from --
02-1672 +++$+++ 321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. I -- I --
02-1672 +++$+++ 322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- from this -- from the question of substantive liability.
02-1672 +++$+++ 323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand that. Here, first of all, when Congress acted, unlike the earlier time when it passed title VI, when Congress passed title IX, it was a background in the law from Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park that -- that retaliation was considered a part of discrimination. The title VI regulations were themselves well known based on identical language, virtually verbatim language. It provided for retaliation. And moreover, this Court as recently as the Davis case, Franklin and Davis, and in the North Haven case has found that employment discrimination, sexual harassment by teachers and peer-on-peer sexual harassment all come within title IX and have, therefore, agreed that Cannon v. the City of -- v. the University of Chicago creates that cause of action. Now, this case is actually a lot easier than Davis, even taking into account the concerns that -- that you and other Justices expressed there, because this is not a case where liability is being imposed, you know, for the acts of third parties like students over whom you may have limited control. This is deliberately undertaken actions by the responsible officials acting intentionally. It's not a novel concept the way one could argue that peer-on-peer sexual harassment was as a part of discrimination. But it's been accepted for more than 30 years by the responsible Federal agency.
02-1672 +++$+++ 324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but it's separate enough from discrimination that in other statutes, although Congress does create a cause of action for discrimination, it goes out of its way to create a separate cause of action for retaliation. It's sufficiently separate, and if it is that sufficiently separate, it doesn't seem to me that you could clearly say that -- that when the State signed on to receiving Federal funds under title IX, they should have known that this door to litigation was being opened to them. Yes, litigation for -- for discrimination against -- against female athletes, but not -- not discrimination suits alleging retaliation. That's a whole, new area.
02-1672 +++$+++ 325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, with -- with all due respect, I don't think there's any way, when the district accepted these funds, that they could have reasonably relied on the assumption that they would be free to retaliate against people who tried to comply --
02-1672 +++$+++ 326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but there was -- there was -- let's go back to this for just a moment -- an administrative remedy available for retaliation expressly under the regs?
02-1672 +++$+++ 327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct.
02-1672 +++$+++ 328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And did this petitioner seek an administrative remedy at all?
02-1672 +++$+++ 329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He did not seek an administrative remedy. He went through the school system itself at every level. He went through five different levels, following the chain of command.
02-1672 +++$+++ 330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What would the administrative remedy have allowed here --
02-1672 +++$+++ 331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
02-1672 +++$+++ 332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- had it been sought?
02-1672 +++$+++ 333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Here, as in Franklin, as in Davis, as in Cannon v. the University of Chicago, as in every one of this Court's title IX cases, indeed, as in all of its title VI cases involving Federal funds with race, you can call this to attention to the office of civil rights of the relevant agency and they can begin an inquiry. Ultimately they have the authority of the draconian sanction of cutting off the funds to the --
02-1672 +++$+++ 334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do they have any other sanction? Because the notion of an administrative remedy ordinarily would be a remedy for the individual who's complaining. But as I understand it, this administrative process, this detailed administrative process, leads only to one sanction, the one you have described as draconian.
02-1672 +++$+++ 335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct.
02-1672 +++$+++ 336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that's it. It would not have permitted a restoration of the job to the --

02-1672 +++$+++ 339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is not part of the -- the administrative process is only about institutional funding, which is why the Court has consistently upheld the right to bring these actions for what are violations of the statute itself.
02-1672 +++$+++ 340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if we don't accept -- let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that -- that we're having trouble accepting the -- the analysis that it is a violation of the statute in the statute's own terms. You then made the argument that, in fact, you should recognize retaliation as a claim because in the context of -- of school students and so on, if you don't allow retaliation, the teachers are not going to blow the whistle, and if the teachers blow the whistle, the statute is going to be a dead letter.
02-1672 +++$+++ 341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is --
02-1672 +++$+++ 342 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so the -- the argument is you -- you should recognize this as a necessity. That, it seems to me, still goes back to Justice O'Connor's question. Why do we have to recognize a private cause of action as opposed to the government allowing an administrative remedy? And I thought you were leading up to saying the administrative remedy simply isn't effective because it's so draconian that, in fact, they don't impose it, or for some other reason. So my question is, is there an argument to say that the administrative remedy simply is not good enough to preclude -- to -- to deter retaliation and that's why you've got to have a private cause of action?
02-1672 +++$+++ 343 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that is absolutely right.
02-1672 +++$+++ 344 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What's -- what are the facts? What's the empirical evidence for that?

02-1672 +++$+++ 346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you know if administrative sanctions have been imposed under title IX against schools?
02-1672 +++$+++ 347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR.

02-1672 +++$+++ 358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It seems to me it's -- it's overwhelmingly effective. You tell the school you either rehire the coach or we're cutting off your money.
02-1672 +++$+++ 359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice --
02-1672 +++$+++ 360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it hard to decide what they're going to do?
02-1672 +++$+++ 361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I do have an answer, first, for Justice Ginsburg's question from Ms. Greensberger. The sanction has never been imposed under title IX of cutting off funds. And it --
02-1672 +++$+++ 362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I can't imagine anyone who would want such a sanction. Which doesn't help --
02-1672 +++$+++ 363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is certainly not what --
02-1672 +++$+++ 364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the girls on the team.
02-1672 +++$+++ 365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- Coach -- Coach Jackson would have sought, and -- and because that process is not one that's responsive to the individual case -- if you're down in Birmingham, Alabama, the idea that there is some office that has control over Federal funds that's never imposed a sanction, the fact of the matter is -- and it's the reason --
02-1672 +++$+++ 366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you're saying the coach cares more about it than the Government does?
02-1672 +++$+++ 367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That may well be the case, absolutely. And Coach Jackson --
02-1672 +++$+++ 368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if -- if the Government is charged with -- with just spending the funds and doesn't think that this is worth its time, why should there be a private cause of action --
02-1672 +++$+++ 369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because --
02-1672 +++$+++ 370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- when -- when a private cause of action is harder for us to imply than it -- than it is to an administrative remedy?
02-1672 +++$+++ 371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because in this case people like Coach Jackson -- it's hard enough for Coach Jackson to come forward. If he's not able to -- if he's not protected and able to come forward, if retaliation is possible, then you can't expect the -- the teenagers themselves to carry this burden. And in fact, it's the reason this Court recognizes a private cause of action in Franklin and in Davis and in Cannon itself, that you're not going to protect the whistle blower and they're not going to be able to come forward. And it's not just whistle blowers, Justice Kennedy. It's people that want to make their institutions comply and when those efforts at compliance result in penalties against them. It has not led to an excessive amount of litigation, but it has been very effective in giving people comfort to know that they can't be retaliated against. And -- and I -- I understand the -- going to the necessity, but I do think I'm very comfortable with the statute because it is a form of discrimination on the basis of sex. It is part and parcel. The history of discrimination, on which title VI drew, was that firing people from their jobs is what you did when they complained about discrimination, when they tried to vote, when they tried to enroll their students in schools, and it is part and parcel of that discrimination. And it is discrimination against Coach Jackson for his actions on behalf of sex. Thank you.
02-1672 +++$+++ 372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. --
02-1672 +++$+++ 373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'll reserve the balance of my time.
02-1672 +++$+++ 374 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Gornstein, do you have any light to shed on the extent to which administrative sanctions have ever been imposed against schools and -- and the feasibility of going that route?
02-1672 +++$+++ 376 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Administrative sanction has never been imposed under title IX.
02-1672 +++$+++ 377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They have been under title VI?
02-1672 +++$+++ 378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There has been one case in which an administrative sanction was imposed under title VI, Justice Kennedy. It -- the agency does have some flexibility to attempt to get voluntary resolutions that are short of the sanction, the final sanction, but --
02-1672 +++$+++ 379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you take the position that what occurred here can amount to a direct violation of the statute as discrimination?
02-1672 +++$+++ 380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We do, Justice -- Justice O'Connor. I'm sorry. Retaliation against a person because that person has complained about sex discrimination under title IX is itself discrimination within the meaning of title IX. And that conclusion flows from four considerations, beginning with the Court's decision critically in Sullivan because in that case, the Court held that a person subjected to retaliation because he complained about racial discrimination against his lessee could sue under section 1982's prohibition, which only prohibits racial discrimination. Against the backdrop of that decision in Sullivan, Congress would have understood its prohibition against sex discrimination to afford comparable protection against retaliation. So a person who is subjected --
02-1672 +++$+++ 381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why would Congress then in some statutes expressly cover retaliation and in others not? I mean, that's a little odd, isn't it?
02-1672 +++$+++ 382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is, Justice O'Connor, but the explanation for that for -- in title VII, for example, is that the core prohibitions in title VII refer to discrimination based on such individual's race, sex, or national origin, and that such individual's language rules out the kind of retaliation claim we are talking about here.
02-1672 +++$+++ 383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It rules out this one, but it doesn't rule out the main -- look it, this is a weird kind of retaliation claim. Usually the retaliation claim is the person who has been discriminated against complains about the discrimination, and for that complaint, the person who was discriminated against is demoted or not promoted, or whatever. That's -- that's the classic retaliation claim. And that classic claim is surely covered by -- on the basis of that person's sex. If --
02-1672 +++$+++ 384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If it's based on the fact that the -- that the person is complaining about sex discrimination and not on the sex of the complainer, it's exactly the same theory of discrimination that we have here, Justice Scalia. And that theory of discrimination was recognized in the Sullivan decision. Discrimination occurs when there is retaliation against a person because he's complaining about racial discrimination.
02-1672 +++$+++ 385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What was the date of the Sullivan case?
02-1672 +++$+++ 386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was 3 years before Congress enacted section -- I think it was '68 -- '69. I'm sorry. '69.
02-1672 +++$+++ 387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ '69.
02-1672 +++$+++ 388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was '69, Justice Scalia.
02-1672 +++$+++ 389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and you think that we take the same approach to implied causes of action today that we took in 1969?
02-1672 +++$+++ 390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You do not, Justice Scalia, when you are starting afresh, but --
02-1672 +++$+++ 391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And we certainly did not with a Spending Clause case.
02-1672 +++$+++ 392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true, Justice Kennedy. But to answer Justice Scalia's question, first, you operate in the legal context in which Congress was operating at the time, and Congress would have understood -- and this Court has twice relied on the Sullivan decision in interpreting title IX, once in deciding that there was a private right of action and once in deciding that the private right of action included a claim for damages.
02-1672 +++$+++ 393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know what case it is, but one of our cases, the argument was precisely made that the statute before us had been enacted by Congress before we had set our face against implied causes of action, and therefore, we should interpret that statute the way we used to in 1969, and we rejected that argument. We said that our new rule, as to when you find implied causes of action, will be applied to all statutes, whether they were enacted by a Congress that -- that thought we would go skipping along forever as we did in 1969 or -- or not. And -- and that's what you're asking us to do here.
02-1672 +++$+++ 394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice --
02-1672 +++$+++ 395 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Just because Congress in -- in the -- at the time this statute was enacted believed in the existence of a Supreme Court that would readily find implied causes of action, we -- we have to do that for all these old statutes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 396 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let -- let me talk about the cases that I think the principle that you're talking about emerges from. One is the Central Bank case, and what you were asked to do there was to add the words, aiders and abetters, to the statute. We're not asking you to add words to this statute. We're asking you to interpret the words that are there --
02-1672 +++$+++ 397 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what about Virginia --
02-1672 +++$+++ 398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in light of the relevant context.
02-1672 +++$+++ 399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What about Virginia Bankshares?
02-1672 +++$+++ 400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm -- I'm not sure about Virginia Bankshares, but I don't think it -- it states a principle. The other case that I was thinking about, Justice Kennedy, is the -- is the Sandoval case. And again, there somebody was asking you to afford a private right of action for something that the statute did not itself prohibit. And what we are saying here is, interpret this statute in light of the legal context that Congress had it, which is --
02-1672 +++$+++ 401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- it's arguable except that Mr. Jackson was not discriminated against because of his gender.
02-1672 +++$+++ 402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. But this statute does not require discrimination because of such individual's sex. It require --
02-1672 +++$+++ 403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- exactly like title VII, but --
02-1672 +++$+++ 404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's -- it's written exactly not like title VII, Justice O'Connor, and it's written far more like section 1982, which was at issue at Sullivan, which doesn't have a such individual's limitation. And in -- and section 1982 was interpreted to mean discrimination on the basis of race in depriving people of interests of property violates that statute and affords a private right of action to the victim of retaliation. And so too here. And a person who is victimized by retaliation because that person has been subjected before -- because he complained about sex discrimination is a victim of discrimination within the meaning of this statute.
02-1672 +++$+++ 405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that's where you hang. You -- you really think Congress, when it enacted title IX, paid close attention and said -- instead of saying no person in the United States shall on the basis of that person's sex be excluded from participation, you think somebody had -- had suggested that language, and they said, oh, no, no, no, that would make it too narrow. We have to take out that person's. I -- I don't -- it doesn't strike me as a -- as an obvious import of not including the word that person's sex. It's a very natural way to write it: no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex.
02-1672 +++$+++ 406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But this is -- it opens it up to this interpretation, and then you have to look at all the relevant considerations. Inserting the words, such individual's, would foreclose that kind of retaliation claim, and it's not here. And so it's -- then you have to look at all the other relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the fact that this is of vital importance to promoting the purposes of the act, including the fact that the agencies responsible for enforcing this provision have both interpreted -- the key agencies have interpreted it to encompass protection against retaliation, and including the fact that there's absolutely no legitimate interest that a -- a recipient has in retaliating against somebody simply because he's filed a title IX sex discrimination complaint.
02-1672 +++$+++ 407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Gornstein, what implication would there be, if we took the view of the circuit here, for Federal employment? Title VII does have a discrete retaliation provision, but it doesn't with respect to Federal employees, if I understand.
02-1672 +++$+++ 408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. In -- it -- we -- we have taken the position that there is, based on a textual argument within the Federal sector provision, a basis for finding a retaliation prohibition over and above the use of discrimination. We have not taken that position with respect to the -- to some other statutes. So we do think this is a statute-by-statute analysis and that you just can't adopt an automatic principle that because there's an anti-discrimination provision, it automatically always picks up retaliation protection. You have to look at it on a statute-by-statute basis. And here, though, all the relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the need for this kind of protection to further the purposes of the statute, including the agencies' interpretation of this statute which, by the way, does provide fair notice that this was prohibited, included in -- I think I wanted to get back to Justice Kennedy's question about the Spending Clause. What the Spending Clause does not require is that it specifically refer to retaliation any more than it required that it specifically refer to peer-on-peer harassment. What it does require, though, is fair notice, and that fair notice is supplied by the Sullivan decision, this Court's cases saying that Sullivan is an important backdrop principle against which title IX was enacted, and finally the regulations themselves, which specifically forbid retaliation.
02-1672 +++$+++ 409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are punitive damages available under title IX?
02-1672 +++$+++ 410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry. Punitive damages would not be available against a municipality or against a -- but it could be available against some other private recipients.
02-1672 +++$+++ 411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Thomas.
02-1672 +++$+++ 413 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: Justice O'Connor, I would like to respond to the question that you raised immediately. I can't think of any school board lawyer who is called by his superintendent and told that I had a letter from OCR and they want to know why you aren't doing this and that who would not be in that superintendent's office that moment because when OCR comes in, they canvas everything. I mean, and as a part of negotiating and their investigative teams, they're lay people. They're not lawyers. They come in demanding, and what they prepare for compliance, I can't even begin to articulate how overreaching it is. And so I say I wanted you to --
02-1672 +++$+++ 414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How often has OCR come to the school district in question under title IX? There are many statutes that --
02-1672 +++$+++ 415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I would want to suggest --
02-1672 +++$+++ 416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- OCR administers.
02-1672 +++$+++ 417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In 1996, we had a conclusion of an OCR title IX investigation because it dealt with boys' football as it related to related sports offered for girls. So we -- we know about OCR, and they're in Atlanta. They are about 167 miles away and when -- and when they come, they come, Your Honors. If I may, I'd like to get right now to what I had raised as the issue here, and that's whether or not an implied private right of action under title IX for retaliation for petitioner who himself says that he's not a victim of discrimination, but merely an advocate. He's an advocate of gender equity, and we say no.
02-1672 +++$+++ 418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How does he differ -- how does he differ from the renter in Sullivan who was complaining about the refusal to sell or lease property to African Americans? He wanted to lease his property, and as a result, he was thrown out of the club. And this Court said he could maintain that suit.
02-1672 +++$+++ 419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I offer this one observation. Under 1982, there is not a corollary administrative remedy. So in the Sullivan situation, the only advocate available at that time was the owner of the home. And -- but I would comment that as he continued in his litigation, he continued to advocate. Under title IX, as we have discussed, for the advocate is the phone call, the toll-free call to OCR and express your concerns and your issues about what's happening. And we find significance in that because the ultimate benefit is for the designated class, which would be the basketball team. In a private lawsuit filed by Mr. Jackson, the damage award goes directly to him. If he's successful in getting injunctive relief, it goes only to him. In other words, school board, you can't retaliate or you're enjoined from retaliating against him in the future, but nothing from that Federal court would go to benefit the girls' basketball team.
02-1672 +++$+++ 420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what -- what do you make of the -- the point that Mr. Dellinger stressed and others have stressed that, in fact, there is no administrative remedy in the real world? It's -- it's -- there -- there have never -- there has never been an instance in which funds have been withheld.
02-1672 +++$+++ 421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, again, Justice Souter, no, the funds have not been terminated. But I can only share with you my experiences with dealing with these people.
02-1672 +++$+++ 422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you with respect to that, is OCR so different from other agencies that have to pick and choose because they simply don't have the resources to enforce? Now, how often does OCR, in fact, go in and investigate? How many times do they say, well, that's low priority for us, girls' soccer or girls' basketball, and we have bigger fish to fry?
02-1672 +++$+++ 423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that I can say is that on my watch, the number one priority is to keep OCR out. So -- so therefore --
02-1672 +++$+++ 424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that wasn't my question. My question is of the universe of complaints that are made under title IX, how many does OCR actually follow up, or isn't it strapped for resources so that it can't, however much it may want to, come in the way you described?
02-1672 +++$+++ 425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, that was something that was recognized in Cannon. I -- I think that was cited in several of the footnotes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that was the very reason for recognizing a private right of action because the -- the requirement, the anti-discrimination requirement, would be a dead letter if you didn't have people who could enforce it.
02-1672 +++$+++ 427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but again, stay mindful. Geraldine Cannon, though, she said, I did not get admission to the -- the med school because of my sex, and she is clearly within the proviso of no discrimination on the basis of sex. So --
02-1672 +++$+++ 428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but the -- the argument that's being raised is whether we're talking about the person who is listed in the statute as the primary beneficiary of the anti-discrimination statute or whether we're talking about the teacher who blows the whistle and so on -- the -- the argument is unless you allow this teacher or this whistle blower to -- to bring the private action, your statute is a dead letter, that the -- that if -- if -- once you recognize a private action, you've either got to recognize this kind of private action or you can forget the whole thing. That's the argument, and -- and so simply to say, well, they're not within the -- the primary ambit of benefit of the statute is -- is not to the point of the argument.
02-1672 +++$+++ 429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, let me offer this in two ways. One, it's not realistic. In -- in other words, when -- when you have a scenario about the private cause of action, teachers aren't -- I mean, these parents and -- and the -- and especially in Birmingham, we have an athletic director at the school. We have a director of athletics for the whole school system. And so that -- that's not realistic, I mean, because at the end of the day, the administration is very conscientious about all of its programs.
02-1672 +++$+++ 430 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's -- to say trust me is -- is not an answer. Cannon is one thing, a woman in her 30's. A sixth-grader who is told she can't play on a team because there's none for girls is hardly similarly situated and the law won't be enforced as to her unless you have someone who is best positioned to know what is going on, who is the coach.
02-1672 +++$+++ 431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, Justice Ginsburg, we get back to the point who really benefits because -- and especially in this scenario, if the advocate sues and receives the monetary damages, that goes to the advocate.
02-1672 +++$+++ 432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the point is if you say to the school, you cannot retaliate against someone because a complaint has been made, that's a powerful incentive for the school not to retaliate against someone and to do something about the discrimination.
02-1672 +++$+++ 433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but again, though, Justice Ginsburg, the other side of that would be when under the spending legislation, the school board had a right to know what the terms and conditions of the financial assistance would be, and I respectfully submit to you that there was nowhere on the landscape that --
02-1672 +++$+++ 434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why wasn't it in the regulations of the agency spelled out rather clearly -- the -- the agency that says, Congress has told us to implement this statute, here are our regulations and our regulations are you don't retaliate?
02-1672 +++$+++ 435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that's a part of the complaint and investigatory process. Now, Justice Ginsburg --
02-1672 +++$+++ 436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The regulations didn't say anything about a private cause of action, did it?
02-1672 +++$+++ 437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it did not.
02-1672 +++$+++ 438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the statute didn't say anything about a private cause of action.
02-1672 +++$+++ 439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not on the face.
02-1672 +++$+++ 440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the regulation did tell the school not to retaliate in effect. Tell me, does the record disclose what happened to the petitioner, Jackson? What -- what has been the result of all this? Does the record tell us that?
02-1672 +++$+++ 441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it does not, Justice O'Connor. And -- and again, it's on a motion to dismiss, and obviously, once it was --
02-1672 +++$+++ 442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does it tell us that he was removed as coach?
02-1672 +++$+++ 443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does the record tell us that?
02-1672 +++$+++ 445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it does say that he was relieved.
02-1672 +++$+++ 446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I ask you a legal question, nothing to do with, you know, practicalities?
02-1672 +++$+++ 447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But suppose you go back to the very old, bad days of the 1950's in the South, the '60's. They pass some civil rights legislation. A lot of legislation was passed in the '60's. Now, under that civil rights legislation, imagine an individual had been kept out of a restaurant or he'd been treated physically badly, not because of his race. He was white, but he was associating with people who were black. And they both go into the restaurant and they both are refused service. Maybe they're beaten up. I mean, both of them. Now, can the white individual bring a lawsuit under the -- the civil rights statute? I've always thought the answer to that question is, of course, he can. Would you -- do you think it's the contrary answer?
02-1672 +++$+++ 449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, in that context --
02-1672 +++$+++ 450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- I -- I would say yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, of course.
02-1672 +++$+++ 453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But again --
02-1672 +++$+++ 454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So therefore --
02-1672 +++$+++ 455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is this a civil rights statute that provides for a private cause of action? I -- I want to know what the hypothetical is.
02-1672 +++$+++ 456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'd -- I'd like to -- I'm thinking of various civil rights statutes which make it unlawful to describe -- to -- to discriminate. And now, I agree with you on that answer. The white person could bring a lawsuit on the basis of someone else's race because he's being discriminated against not because of his own race, but because he's being -- he's associated with people who are being discriminated against. I agree with your answer. And so my question is if that's so and if we have a long history here of the words, on the basis of sex, including retaliation not on the basis of my sex, but retaliation on the basis of someone else's sex -- that's what I've complained of -- why isn't this the same thing And to get out my whole question -- there are two parts -- why isn't this the same thing? And the second part is, because I think it is the same thing -- the second part is once it is included in 1981 -- in -- is it 1681(a)?
02-1672 +++$+++ 457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Once we include this in 1681(a), that's the end of this case because Sandoval then supports the other side. It doesn't support you. All right. That's my question.
02-1672 +++$+++ 459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, don't we have to consider at some point in time what the congressional intent was?
02-1672 +++$+++ 460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And again -- and I submit to you --
02-1672 +++$+++ 462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you -- you go ahead. I'm doing it purely as a matter of logic. I'm saying the old civil rights cases make clear it doesn't have to be on the basis of your own race. History makes clear that retaliation on the basis of someone else's race does fit within -- or gender does fit within 1681, and then that's the end of the case. So I would like your response to that logic.
02-1672 +++$+++ 463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I would want to submit to you interveningly you have had the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. So everybody now has access to Congress. The whole spectrum of American society is in Congress. So if Congress is being well represented, when it passes the law in 1972, as it did here, it had a different perspective on it. Going back to 1969, some things were foreclosed to some of the citizens of the United States. So, obviously, the scenario of someone advocating, like in Sullivan, would make sense. But I submit to you respectfully, that's not the case now. Over there in Congress is where this debate needs to be, and on the face of this statute, it's not there. Retaliation is not there. If I may, though, Justice Breyer, let me also add as a practical consideration --
02-1672 +++$+++ 464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course, you say it's not there, but the agencies interpreting the statute thought it was there. Isn't that correct?
02-1672 +++$+++ 465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but that's an -- an investigatory -- the administrative enforcement scenario.
02-1672 +++$+++ 466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it's the --
02-1672 +++$+++ 467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but their reading of the statute was that the word discrimination included a retaliation claim. That's the kind of regulations they drafted on the basis of their understanding of what Congress intended by using the word -- the words in this statute.
02-1672 +++$+++ 468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But don't we go -- Justice Stevens, don't we go back to Sandoval? Can you in a regulation do more than what the statute requires?
02-1672 +++$+++ 469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You cannot use the regulation that goes beyond the meaning of the statute. That's what that holds. But a regulation interpreting what the statute itself provides is in a different ball park. And that's what I understand these regulations to have done, to say what the agencies thought the statute itself meant.
02-1672 +++$+++ 470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but again, that's retaliation after someone has filed a complaint with the appropriate office.
02-1672 +++$+++ 471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well -- I mean, Sandoval is very clear. It's a very clear opinion in my view. Very clear. And the key language I thought is, the language statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer the private right. So they're looking at disparate impact and disparate impact, according to the majority -- I was in the dissent -- did not intend to protect the person discriminated against, but was a way of regulating people so they wouldn't intentionally discriminate. I can understand that. But I apply the same -- I didn't agree with it, but I can understand it. The -- the -- I apply the same reasoning here. The reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not trying to protect university behavior one whit more than the whole underlying thing is trying to protect university behavior. This is about victims. Retaliation and being fired is about victims. And so given Sandoval, then we have the history, we have the language, and we have that sentence from Sandoval. And all that suggests -- it goes into 1681(a), in which case Sandoval says, a private right of action, given Cannon, would be inferred. Now, what's -- what's -- that's how -- I'm tracing out the logic of the thing. So I want to see what you say.
02-1672 +++$+++ 472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Breyer, on the face of the statute, I just can't get there. I apologize for that, respectfully, but -- but I can't. And Justice O'Connor, as a follow-up, interestingly enough, in a case on all fours in 1995, Holt v. Lewis, the United States District Dourt for the Northern District of Birmingham -- for the Northern District of Alabama made very clear that an implied private right of action was not cognizable under title IX, and that the regulation was not a basis to follow it. And -- and I submit to you on that basis, that in Birmingham, at very least, because the case was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit and this Court denied cert in 1997, so anyone who would go --
02-1672 +++$+++ 473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We -- we can't -- you don't base your argument on giving some legal effect to denial of certiorari --
02-1672 +++$+++ 474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, I don't, Justice O'Connor.
02-1672 +++$+++ 475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you.
02-1672 +++$+++ 476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but to say -- I was trying to emphasize was the notice and the mind set of the board when it accepted these Federal funds. It had no way of anticipating that retaliation --
02-1672 +++$+++ 477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It had never anticipated a private right of action, even though it read the Cannon opinion, which was written some 20 years ago? Maybe more than that. I don't remember.
02-1672 +++$+++ 478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Cannon, your opinion there is going to be around for a long time. The scholars are going to have to debate it for years.
02-1672 +++$+++ 479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There were some later cases that cast a good deal of doubt on whether we would apply Cannon anymore.
02-1672 +++$+++ 480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But Congress itself has adopted the rule set forth in Cannon.
02-1672 +++$+++ 481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but if I may, but then Justice Rehnquist cautioned very clearly that the Court -- in his concurring opinion, that the Court in the future should be extremely reluctant to imply a cause of action absent such specificity on the part of the legislative branch. And that just speaks volumes to me.
02-1672 +++$+++ 482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It said in this statute we do, having in mind that title VI would be interpreted in the identical way --
02-1672 +++$+++ 483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
02-1672 +++$+++ 484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- title VII -- VI proscribing race discrimination in all Federal programs. So it said these statutes aimed at race discrimination, sex discrimination do have a -- a private right of action, and that was the holding of this Court.
02-1672 +++$+++ 485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. Well, but -- but again, it goes -- goes back to -- but would that include retaliation? And -- and --
02-1672 +++$+++ 486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it seems to me that if you're talking about the sixth grade soccer team, realistically the only one who is going to know anything -- enough and be brave enough to complain will be the teacher. And if you cut the teacher out, then forget it. You have nice words on paper and they'll never be enforced.
02-1672 +++$+++ 487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, Justice Ginsburg, that teacher could easily, if they don't get a positive response from the administration, they can call OCR.
02-1672 +++$+++ 488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And OCR says, as it usually does, we're too busy. Sorry.
02-1672 +++$+++ 489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. They -- no --
02-1672 +++$+++ 490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Congress didn't give us enough money to do the job.
02-1672 +++$+++ 491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we know that? I mean, do we have any idea how effective the enforcement of OCR is? Just because they haven't cut off funds --
02-1672 +++$+++ 492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I --
02-1672 +++$+++ 493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- they may well not have cut off funds because anybody who gets a directive from them will hop to it.
02-1672 +++$+++ 494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, that's exactly it. I mean, I have firsthand knowledge that when they call, we're supposed to jump. It's no doubt about it.
02-1672 +++$+++ 495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And do they call more than infrequently?
02-1672 +++$+++ 496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All the time. And -- and the other side of that coin --
02-1672 +++$+++ 497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is your personal testimony.
02-1672 +++$+++ 498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. Yes, it is. (Laughter.)
02-1672 +++$+++ 499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and Justice --
02-1672 +++$+++ 500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is -- there is much testimony on the other side that says we call and call and they don't come.
02-1672 +++$+++ 501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I've been in educational law now almost 27 years, representing both teachers and school boards. So I have firsthand knowledge. I mean -- and I've experienced it both at the secondary level and higher ed. I mean, when they come in, they come in.
02-1672 +++$+++ 502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How many title IX complaints in your -- in your experience? You mentioned one. Is there any other?
02-1672 +++$+++ 503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Two.
02-1672 +++$+++ 504 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Two? In how many years?
02-1672 +++$+++ 505 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In 26.
02-1672 +++$+++ 506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Two in 20-something years.
02-1672 +++$+++ 507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. But they're all memorable. (Laughter.)
02-1672 +++$+++ 508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're all -- thank you.
02-1672 +++$+++ 509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Mr. Newsom.
02-1672 +++$+++ 511 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address, if I may, several concerns that have been raised during the -- the preceding arguments. One is to clarify some things about the scope of the administrative remedy. The other side, with respect, wants you to think that without the implied right of action for damages and fees, whistle blowers are left out in the cold. That is not true. The administrative remedy -- it's not just about funding termination. 34 C.F.R. 106.3 says that the OCR may use any remedy that it deems necessary. The OCR, as we say in our brief, has itself touted its flexible approach to enforcement which includes, among other things, as this Court noted in Gebser, citing back to its earlier -- pardon me -- decision in North Haven, individualized relief in appropriate circumstances. So the point, as Senator Bayh himself noted on the floor of the Senate, is that it is the threat of -- of funding termination. So while the OCR is wielding the club of funding termination, they can extract or leverage individualized relief in appropriate cases.
02-1672 +++$+++ 512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we -- do we have any -- any empirical evidence as to -- as to what they have thus leveraged?
02-1672 +++$+++ 513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ None that I am aware of, Your -- Your Honor, but --
02-1672 +++$+++ 514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the other side says, look, dead letter. What do we know about such life as there may be in the letter?
02-1672 +++$+++ 515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well -- well, I will, I assume, perhaps foolishly, defer to the Solicitor General's office to tell you what -- what the DOJ has and hasn't done. What I can tell you is that -- that the DOJ manual that the other side cites throughout its briefs expressly encourages agencies, when enforcing these -- these things, to leverage even damage awards on behalf of individual claimants. So I can tell you that, as a matter of policy, this is far from a dead letter.
02-1672 +++$+++ 516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- you don't concede the point that it is the role of this Court to determine whether agencies are inefficient or not --
02-1672 +++$+++ 517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course not.
02-1672 +++$+++ 518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and if they are inefficient to -- to raise up private attorneys general to -- to fill the void?
02-1672 +++$+++ 519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course not, Justice Scalia, and -- and the Court knows very well from my brief that our position is that when you're talking about implied rights of action, this Court has made clear, in the cases leading up to Sandoval, culminating in Sandoval, that these sorts of policy considerations really are not relevant.
02-1672 +++$+++ 520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. If they're not relevant, do you think that the regulation which provides -- do you think it's unlawful?
02-1672 +++$+++ 521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do not contest the validity of the regulation.
02-1672 +++$+++ 522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. If you don't contest the validity of it and you think it's lawful, do you think it's doing something other than interpreting 1681(a)?
02-1672 +++$+++ 523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor.
02-1672 +++$+++ 524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What -- what is it doing?
02-1672 +++$+++ 525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- section 100.7(e), the regulation upon which Jackson chiefly relies, we readily concede is a valid, effectuating 902 regulation, but all -- all it does by its text -- and its structure makes clear all it does -- is to govern the internal processes of official OCR investigations. It does not go further than that. This Court in Sandoval was very clear that it was -- that it was only authoritative interpretations of a statute's terms that can be enforced pursuant to that statute's implied right of action. Another point I want to make about the administrative remedy. Justice Ginsburg asked whether funds had ever been withdrawn, and even there, again, if the answer is no, the point is not whether funds have been withdrawn, but that as Senator Bayh himself noted, that the threat of funds is where the heavy lifting is done in administrative enforcement. Another point about administrative enforcement is whether or not there are sufficient resources. That, obviously, was a valid concern in Cannon, given presumably the inordinate number of complaints about core, traditional discrimination. But as the other side has made clear in its briefing in this case, at page 26 of the petitioner's brief -- and then there's a brief filed on behalf of the Southern Poverty Law Center that spins this out in some detail -- there just aren't many of these retaliation claims out there, either in the -- either -- either in the judicial system or at OCR.
02-1672 +++$+++ 526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is that, do you think?
02-1672 +++$+++ 527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, my -- I'm sorry.
02-1672 +++$+++ 528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it because no remedy is available, or is it because there are just very few instances giving rise to such?
02-1672 +++$+++ 529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think in all likelihood, it is the latter. Certainly I would think that the Court would presume -- would not presume ill of local school districts and -- and even State universities, but would presume that they are complying with, if not clearly articulated law, certainly good public policy. The second point is that what the -- the absence of private actions for retaliation shows is that title IX's remedial apparatus is kicking along just fine without the implied right of action.
02-1672 +++$+++ 530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we decide this case on the assumption that there was retaliation here by virtue of a complaint of violation of title IX?
02-1672 +++$+++ 531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Certainly, Your Honor --
02-1672 +++$+++ 532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We should decide it on that assumption?
02-1672 +++$+++ 533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You have to take as true, of course, the facts as pledged in the -- as pleaded in the complaint. Another point I'd like to make briefly is about the comparison to title VII. The other side wants you to look very closely at title VII when you're -- whether it's on the basis of sex or on the basis of such individual's sex, but they want you to ignore title VII and the fact that it very clearly and expressly deals with retaliation in a separate subsection, a separate provision. And I didn't -- I'll have to confess I didn't hear much during the first argument. I had my head in my own book, but what I did hear is Justice Souter referring to the -- the -- an instance in which Congress has a choice of two models for -- for constructing a statute, and it chooses one over the other, and isn't it a reasonable inference to allow Congress to make that choice. That's what happened here.
02-1672 +++$+++ 534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Like the choice it made in 1982, very spare statute. When Congress got to title IX, it knew about Sullivan and so it -- this -- this statute in its breadth and its simplicity bears a striking resemblance to the old pattern in 1981 and 1982 and 1983. So if you say to me, look at the closest model, it would be that and not the more detailed civil rights legislation that came in '64 and '65.
02-1672 +++$+++ 535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if -- if I could answer in two parts. First, to say that I think what was going on in 1964 in the Civil Rights Act, obviously, you have Congress in title VII addressing itself both to discrimination and to retaliation separately; in title VI, passed as part of the same piece of legislation, addressing itself solely to discrimination. And to use Justice Souter's analogy, in '72 Congress takes the title VI model and not the title VII model. Now, to get to your question specifically, I think, about Sullivan is at the heart of your question, Sullivan -- I think there are a number of problems with the other side's reliance on Sullivan. First, with all due respect to this Court, Sullivan itself is pretty opaque. It certainly does not announce with flashing lights a principle that every anti-discrimination provision necessarily entails a subsidiary or corollary --
02-1672 +++$+++ 536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It says if you're thrown out of the club because you champion the rights of a black man, you have a right to sue under this statute.
02-1672 +++$+++ 537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Even if I were to grant your assumption of clarity in Sullivan, which Justice Harlan, I presume, would not agree with -- he was left sort of scratching his head trying to figure out what the Court was trying to do. But even granting your assumption, if 1982 can be construed that way, that -- that construction does not necessarily carry over to every anti-discrimination provision. 1982, of course, uses different language to begin with and, more importantly, is -- is passed under Congress's power under the Thirteenth Amendment, which is the broadest conceivable --
02-1672 +++$+++ 538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but it did construe the word discrimination, didn't it?
02-1672 +++$+++ 539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, sir. Discrimination is not even in -- is not even in title -- rather, in 1982. So the language is very different --
02-1672 +++$+++ 540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ On account of race is in it. Right?
02-1672 +++$+++ 541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'll have to confess I don't -- it does say something like every person shall have the same right as -- dot, dot, dot, as white persons. But so the -- the language frankly is pretty different, and the more fundamental point I'm trying to make is that even if that's true for -- for that statute passed under that constitutional power, here we are talking, as Justice Kennedy made clear at the very outset of the argument about a Spending Clause statute, where it is required that conditions on the acceptance of Federal funds be express, and it is not clear to me where the Birmingham Board would have gotten its clear notice in this case. If you can imagine --
02-1672 +++$+++ 542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me they would get it when Congress says, and here's the statute, very spare, and agency, you get up guidelines, that any responsible school board would say, well, we've got only one sentence in the statute. We better look at the regulations to find out what's required.
02-1672 +++$+++ 543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I agree, and -- and if -- and if the Birmingham Board, which I trust it did, looked to the regulation here, what it would have found is a regulation not that clarifies the substantive scope of title IX, but instead that -- that manages the internal operating procedures for official agency investigations. So to be sure, the Birmingham Board was on notice that it could not retaliate in -- in the business of an official OCR investigation, and if it did, it would be subject to administrative enforcement, but it was -- it was not on notice either of the fact that there was a generic anti-retaliation prohibition, much less the fact that if it violated any such nonexistent --
02-1672 +++$+++ 544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it's -- we're not talking about the procedure, I mean, what procedural moves. What must you do to comply? And it has in there you don't retaliate. So you mean that a board could responsibly take the position, well, the -- the regulations tell us we don't retaliate, but when we're not faced with any agency breathing down our neck, all we have is a teacher in front of us, then we can retaliate? I mean, they must have known the statute meant don't retaliate.
02-1672 +++$+++ 545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and with respect, I think there is a difference, particularly given the clear notice requirements that this Court has -- has used in Spending Clause cases between retaliation in the context of an OCR investigation and retaliation generally, but -- I'm sorry.
02-1672 +++$+++ 546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I really don't get that. If the rule is don't retaliate and if we investigate, that's one of the things we're going -- that's going to be on our checklist. But the substantive rule is don't retaliate.
02-1672 +++$+++ 547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, may I respond?
02-1672 +++$+++ 548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Even granting your assumption, Justice Ginsburg, what is painfully not clear is that the -- is that the Birmingham Board would be subject to -- to a private right of action for damages and fees even in -- in the event that there were some generally applicable anti-retaliation provision.
02-1672 +++$+++ 550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Newsom.
02-1672 +++$+++ 551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens.
02-1672 +++$+++ 552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Dellinger, you have about 3 and a half minutes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 554 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I should make it clear that we're not asking this Court to create or infer a new cause of action. We're asking the Court to interpret the cause of action that the Court itself recognized in Cannon v. the University of Chicago, that was validated by Congress. It was reaffirmed in the Court's opinion in Sandoval. And when you look at the scope of that -- of that prohibition, that cause of action, why would it not extend to retaliation? The idea that you --
02-1672 +++$+++ 555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Other statutes do it separately.
02-1672 +++$+++ 556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand.
02-1672 +++$+++ 557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Other statutes don't view the one as -- as being incorporated in the other.
02-1672 +++$+++ 558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The practice of Congress has not been consistent on incorporating express provisions sometimes because of language differences, but there are half a dozen major statutes that the courts of appeal have consistently assumed included retaliation as part of discrimination. Section 1981, section 1982, title VI, 1982 as determined by this Court, parts of the Rehabilitation Act have all been construed that way. And why would they not? The notion that you have to admit Geraldine Cannon to the University of Chicago Medical School, you can't discriminate against her on the basis of sex, but then you could turn around and expel her for complaining about your admissions policy makes no sense. In this case, relying upon the vagaries of what any administration might do about enforcement is not necessarily what Congress wanted, and that was this Court's decision in Cannon. And it's reaffirmed it frankly --
02-1672 +++$+++ 559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There are no vagaries in private enforcement. Private attorneys general always act in the interest of the whole polity. There are no vagaries there.
02-1672 +++$+++ 560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in this case, it has been known to effectuate anti-discrimination laws in order to bring them about by allowing people to step forward. The last point they make is that even if there's a cause of action, and even if the cause of action covers retaliation, it cannot be brought by Coach Jackson because he's not also the victim of the underlying discrimination. That makes no sense in law or in logic. If the captain of the boys' basketball team joins with the captain of the girls' basketball team in a supportive way to say, they're just not treating girls' basketball equally and fairly, and they're both suspended from their teams or dropped from the honor society in retaliation, it makes no sense. Either they both have -- they've both been discriminated against on the basis of sex because they're trying to rectify sex discrimination or neither is. And in this case, it's going to be critically important that this valuable statute, which has meant so much for athletic and academic opportunities for women, to have people like Coach Jackson able to be confident that they've got a right that they can enforce that will allow them to come forward within the school itself and try to rectify these anomalies in and under title IX. Thank you.
02-1672 +++$+++ 561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Dellinger. The case is submitted.
03-10198 +++$+++ 565 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument now in Antonio Dwayne Halbert v. Michigan. Mr. Moran.
03-10198 +++$+++ 567 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether, 42 years after this Court decided in Douglas v. California that indigent defendants have the right to the assistance of counsel for a first-tier direct felony appeal --
03-10198 +++$+++ 568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, now, Douglas didn't involve a guilty plea, I guess.
03-10198 +++$+++ 569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It did not, Your Honor. It was a trial case.
03-10198 +++$+++ 570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And did the Court say anything about the effect of having it be a guilty plea? I guess it didn't.
03-10198 +++$+++ 571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It did not. None of this Court's cases in the Douglas line have turned on whether the conviction was by trial or by plea.
03-10198 +++$+++ 572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does that make a difference or could it?
03-10198 +++$+++ 573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't believe it does, Your Honor, because as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, all sorts of difficult, technical issues can arise in a guilty plea. Of course, certain issues are waived. Trial issues are waived by the effect of a guilty plea, but many other issues remain. And as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, especially in the guilty plea cases -- this Court well knows the effect of the Federal sentencing guidelines -- very complicated issues of sentencing law arise. And now Michigan has a sentencing guideline system that is perhaps more complicated than the Federal system that's been in effect since the 1980's.
03-10198 +++$+++ 574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Did -- did your client waive any right to appeal here in connection with the proceedings of the plea?
03-10198 +++$+++ 575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He did not waive a right to file an application for leave to appeal. Because of the --
03-10198 +++$+++ 576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What did he waive?
03-10198 +++$+++ 577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He waived the right to have a -- to have what is called in Michigan an automatic appeal, in other words, the right to automatically have full briefing and oral argument. So what he agreed to by pleading was to go through the application for leave to appeal procedure which involves a preliminary determination of merit as to whether the appeal should proceed.
03-10198 +++$+++ 578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why didn't he waive the right to have counsel for that -- for that purpose since that was the law in Michigan?
03-10198 +++$+++ 579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, he did not -- first of all, as a matter of fact, he did not. He was never told at any point during the plea proceedings that he would be giving up his right to counsel.
03-10198 +++$+++ 580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, he was told what -- what right to counsel he would have and it didn't include this.
03-10198 +++$+++ 581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He was told that under certain circumstances the judge would appoint counsel.
03-10198 +++$+++ 582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the judge never said, under any other circumstances, I will not appoint counsel.
03-10198 +++$+++ 584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, isn't that a perfectly natural inference if you're told you get A and B, that C and D might have been -- that C and D will not be given?
03-10198 +++$+++ 585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It might be a natural inference for somebody with a level of sophistication, but Mr. Halbert is a special education student, functionally illiterate. And nobody explained to him that he wouldn't be given his right to counsel.
03-10198 +++$+++ 586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, did we take this case on the ground that he wasn't adequately advised or did we take the case on the ground that even if he were advised, he'd still have his right?
03-10198 +++$+++ 587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I hope the latter, Justice Kennedy, because this is a case in which the State is making a waiver argument. And, of course, the waiver argument is not part of -- is not the intent of the statute. What the statute does is it tacks on and, by the way, the defendant should be advised at the time of the plea that they won't be getting counsel.
03-10198 +++$+++ 588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I take it you would challenge the validity of the waiver even if he were advised?
03-10198 +++$+++ 589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-10198 +++$+++ 590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And even if he said, I hereby waive?
03-10198 +++$+++ 591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, we would because that is a waiver that is designed to extract only from the poor. That waiver has no effect whatsoever on those with money because, in fact, a money defendant is not even eligible for appointed counsel on appeal. So that waiver has no effect whatsoever on --
03-10198 +++$+++ 592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, wouldn't -- I'm -- I'm sorry.
03-10198 +++$+++ 593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would have no effect whatsoever on money defendants I'm saying.
03-10198 +++$+++ 594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wouldn't your position be different if he had been advised that he had exactly the right that you claim he has, and the court said, however, in Michigan you may not enter the -- the plea unless you waive that right? If -- if you don't want to waive that right, which I've just explained to you, we'll -- we'll have a trial. Would -- would your answer still be that -- that waiver would be as a matter of law impossible?
03-10198 +++$+++ 595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The waiver would be unconstitutional under those conditions because it is a discriminatory waiver. To show how breathtaking the State's argument --
03-10198 +++$+++ 596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How -- why is that prejudicial to him? He says, okay, I can't plead guilty. I really did it but I can't plead guilty. Go ahead.
03-10198 +++$+++ 597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry.
03-10198 +++$+++ 598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why doesn't he just have a trial? He says, I'm not going to contest the trial.
03-10198 +++$+++ 599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, as this Court has long recognized, a trial provides very substantial benefit. I mean, excuse me. A guilty plea provides very substantial benefits. And so the effect of the Michigan statute then would be only the money defendant can receive the benefits of a guilty plea and then have sentencing errors corrected.
03-10198 +++$+++ 600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, is that what you were going to say to Justice Souter, before I interrupted, that it's -- that it's far-reaching.
03-10198 +++$+++ 601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Well, not only that, if the State's waiver argument is correct, then presumably the State could extract a waiver saying you can't have free transcripts. You can't have the waiver of the filing fees. In fact, the State could extract a waiver saying you can't have counsel at sentencing.
03-10198 +++$+++ 602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ These are all disparate impact arguments. There's -- there's -- you're not making any argument that the State intentionally discriminates against the poor. You're just saying the effect of this is harder on the poor than it is on the rich. But I thought our -- our equal protection cases have -- have said that disparate impact doesn't -- doesn't hack it as far as equal protection is concerned.
03-10198 +++$+++ 603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, I actually have two responses to that. First, this is intentionally aimed at the poor. Looking at 770.3a, the statute under -- in question here, it is clearly aimed at the indigent. It refers to the indigent. So this is a statute that on its face is -- is taking away the right of the indigent and only the indigent to have -- have an attorney. So I don't agree that is is a -- simply a disparate impact case. But in the context of appellate counsel for a first-tier felony appeal, this Court's cases have -- have not applied the same line of analysis that this Court has applied in other contexts, and I think that's quite clear most recently in the MLB case --
03-10198 +++$+++ 604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In any event, you pointed out that on the face there is the distinction on the face of it --
03-10198 +++$+++ 605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- it is not a disparate impact case at all --
03-10198 +++$+++ 607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- because it affects only indigents.
03-10198 +++$+++ 609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. There is no question that this statute was enacted for and specifically applies only to the indigent. It has -- it has no impact whatsoever on the wealthy, and it's aimed at the -- at the indigent only. So I do -- I do not agree that this --
03-10198 +++$+++ 610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Whenever a State has -- has initially given a broad benefit to the poor, whenever it cuts back on poor -- on part of that benefit, it is denying equal protection to the poor? That -- that seems to be an extraordinary proposition. The State isn't picking on the poor. It's just saying that -- that the -- the free counsel we have agreed to provide in the past we're no longer going to provide in this -- in this one instance of guilty pleas. And -- and you say that -- that is intentional discrimination against the poor?
03-10198 +++$+++ 611 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's not a -- a disparate impact claim I say, because it is intentionally aimed at the poor. The statute was designed to take away counsel from the poor and only from the poor.
03-10198 +++$+++ 612 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So any cutback on benefits that is given -- on benefits that are given to the poor is intentional discrimination against the poor.
03-10198 +++$+++ 613 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not saying any, Justice Scalia.
03-10198 +++$+++ 614 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Just this one because that's your case.
03-10198 +++$+++ 615 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This case certainly is.
03-10198 +++$+++ 616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're saying this is case like Douglas which was equal protection, like a free transcript, like a filing fee for an appeal.
03-10198 +++$+++ 617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 618 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're bracketing --
03-10198 +++$+++ 619 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This case -- in many ways the restrictions that are placed on the indigent's ability to appeal in Michigan, as a result of this statute, are worse than those that were struck down in Douglas because at least in Douglas the court, the appellate court, would review the entire transcript, looking for arguable issues. We don't even have that here. All we have here is the indigent forced to shift for himself, forced to try and determine whether there are any issues, forced to order his own transcript. Under the Michigan statute, the indigent has to figure out how to obtain his or her docket entries, his or her transcripts, his or her prisoner account statements, all the documents necessary for filing a first appeal that would ordinarily be done by counsel. And so --
03-10198 +++$+++ 620 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I just understand one point that Justice Scalia's question raises for me? In your view, is the provision of counsel for the indigent for appellate purposes purely a matter of grace, or was there some underlying obligation to provide counsel?
03-10198 +++$+++ 621 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, it's my -- it's certainly my contention, Justice Stevens, that Michigan is required to afford appellate counsel in this situation for a first-tier direct felony appeal on the merits.
03-10198 +++$+++ 622 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that ultimately your case rests not on equal protection but due process.
03-10198 +++$+++ 623 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's a merger of both principles, as this Court said --
03-10198 +++$+++ 624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's one as much as the other, isn't it?
03-10198 +++$+++ 625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, you're -- we're saying if you're going to provide a first appeal of right, one incident of that is, as a matter of due process, you've got to provide counsel.
03-10198 +++$+++ 627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Souter.
03-10198 +++$+++ 628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you're -- you're retracting the pure equal protection claim? I don't think you want to do that. I mean, you would say that even if there were not a due process right, you would still regard this as -- as directed against the poor.
03-10198 +++$+++ 629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is directed --
03-10198 +++$+++ 630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or not?
03-10198 +++$+++ 631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is directed against the poor, which is why there is an equal protection component to this argument, but this Court's cases --
03-10198 +++$+++ 632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you say that component wouldn't exist unless you begin with a due process right to have counsel on appeal.
03-10198 +++$+++ 633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe that's right. It's -- it's difficult -- I have to confess, Your Honor, it's difficult sometimes to separate out the due process and equal protection strands from the Griffin and Douglas line, and this Court most recently in MLB said that there is a certain merger. Also, I believe in Smith v. Robbins this Court reiterated that there is a certain merger of the lines in these cases. But --
03-10198 +++$+++ 634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're -- you're saying that the due process is what gets you beyond the stage of merely providing counsel as a matter of grace. That's what due process does for you. Because they have to provide counsel not merely as a matter of grace, you have a very clear equal protection case which you would not otherwise have. Isn't -- isn't that the way the two work together?
03-10198 +++$+++ 635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that's right, Justice Souter. I think I agree with that.
03-10198 +++$+++ 636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can -- in your view, can the State require a waiver of the right to appeal for everyone?
03-10198 +++$+++ 637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's a question this Court hasn't decided, and I don't have a position on that. But that's far different from this case because that would not be discriminatory.
03-10198 +++$+++ 638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'm not so sure. It certainly goes to the importance or the significance of the underlying right. My understanding is -- correct me if I'm wrong -- that in the Federal system, we require waivers of the right to appeal frequently, even waiver of the right to appeal the sentence even before the sentence is calculated, as I understand it.
03-10198 +++$+++ 639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And do you question the lawfulness of that?
03-10198 +++$+++ 641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't. And that -- that case has not come before this Court yet, and so I don't know how this Court would decide that case if it comes. I know some of the Federal circuits have upheld such appellate waivers as a part of a negotiated guilty plea. One thing the Michigan statute is -- does is it takes away the right to appeal effectively for indigents without negotiation. It's -- it's the baseline.
03-10198 +++$+++ 642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Mr. Moran, if -- if you're -- if you're tying your equal protection claim to a due process claim and if it is not a violation of due process to require people to waive their -- I mean, you can waive entirely the right to appeal. Surely you can waive the right to counsel on appeal. If that's not a violation of due process, then your equal protection claim dissolves.
03-10198 +++$+++ 643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, the problem is -- is that the statute requires only the poor, imposes a forced waiver on only the poor.
03-10198 +++$+++ 644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's an equal protection claim.
03-10198 +++$+++ 645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's an equal protection claim.
03-10198 +++$+++ 646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you've -- you've said your equal protection claim hinges on the due process claim. If the due process claim, in turn, hinges upon waiver, then apart from the -- from the dispute in this case as to whether waiver occurred or not, if waiver does occur, there's no due process claim, and then there's no equal protection claim.
03-10198 +++$+++ 647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm really not sure that you can separate out the two strands of the Fourteenth Amendment again, and I know this Court didn't try in MLB, and I know this Court didn't try in Smith v. Robbins, so that there is -- there is a component of both. And it's precisely because of these sorts of questions that I think you have to view them as an integrated whole for purposes of the Griffin/Douglas line.
03-10198 +++$+++ 648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In any case --
03-10198 +++$+++ 649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where -- where do we find the waiver here? Is it in the joint appendix?
03-10198 +++$+++ 650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's my position there was no waiver, but the --
03-10198 +++$+++ 651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you referred to something that was waived.
03-10198 +++$+++ 652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where would we find that?
03-10198 +++$+++ 654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the plea proceeding. It's the plea proceeding. And it's --
03-10198 +++$+++ 655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, don't take your time to look it up. Maybe counsel for respondent can find it for us.
03-10198 +++$+++ 656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's -- it's in the joint appendix --
03-10198 +++$+++ 657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- beginning on page 19.
03-10198 +++$+++ 659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's their argument anyway. Let them --
03-10198 +++$+++ 660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm missing something on waiver, but I would have thought a person can waive a -- a right to have a counsel on appeal. He can waive a trial. He can waive a jury trial. But before he has to -- before he decides, he has to know that he has the constitutional right to a jury trial.
03-10198 +++$+++ 661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And why wouldn't he also have to have the -- to know that he has the constitutional right to a lawyer to represent him?
03-10198 +++$+++ 663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's my position Justice
03-10198 +++$+++ 664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. That has nothing to do with equal protection. It has to do simply with a very common sense rule that we apply in every case, jury trial, et cetera. So all we'd have to say is, of course, he has a right to a lawyer. Now, if he wants to go back and waive that right, fine.
03-10198 +++$+++ 665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's all. That's the end of it.
03-10198 +++$+++ 667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So what's all this complicated thing about?
03-10198 +++$+++ 669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If an indigent, after being sentenced, decided for whatever reason I would prefer to go on appeal by myself, which is actually a -- a right this Court rejected in Martinez, that you have a right to represent yourself on appeal, but in Michigan an indigent is allowed to -- would be allowed to represent himself or herself on appeal if they chose to do so. The problem here is that the statute purports to take away the right, and it's our position that this is a --
03-10198 +++$+++ 670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. You'd have to say the statute is wrong in taking away the right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But he can waive it if he wants to, knowing that he has the right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right. We have no problem with a voluntary waiver. We certainly have a problem with a forced waiver saying that you cannot enter a plea which produces tremendous benefits in Michigan, as everywhere else, unless -- unless you agree to waiver --
03-10198 +++$+++ 674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, but -- but that happens all the time. I mean, the waiver -- waiver of appeal in -- in guilty -- in guilty pleas. That's -- that's not permissible either?
03-10198 +++$+++ 675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I take no position on that. It may or may not permissible.
03-10198 +++$+++ 676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you have to if you're going to make the argument you just made.
03-10198 +++$+++ 677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's far different because that's something that can be obtained in negotiation. But what we would have --
03-10198 +++$+++ 678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Mr. Moran, here on page 22 of the joint appendix, the court is speaking to the defendant and says, you understand if I accept your plea, you are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal as of right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you think that was not effective?
03-10198 +++$+++ 681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. That was effective. That -- that's referring to the automatic appeal that he would have if he went to trial where he would have full briefing and oral argument. The Michigan --
03-10198 +++$+++ 682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- it doesn't say that.
03-10198 +++$+++ 683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, it doesn't. This was a -- this was a pretty poor waiver proceeding in a number of -- of respects, but it --
03-10198 +++$+++ 684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, he does --
03-10198 +++$+++ 685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm --
03-10198 +++$+++ 686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- he does go on to say that -- that he can appoint a lawyer for -- in certain instances. He doesn't complete the explanation by saying there are other instances and when I will not appoint one. That he leaves out, although this a represented defendant.
03-10198 +++$+++ 687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, he was.
03-10198 +++$+++ 688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He had a counsel at the plea hearing.
03-10198 +++$+++ 689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He did.
03-10198 +++$+++ 690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm mixed up again. What is the answer to this? I -- I would have thought that even if those words that Justice O'Connor read referred directly to the kind of appeal that we have in front of us -- in other words, the one that's at issue -- that still he'd have to know he has a right to a lawyer on that appeal before he could waive it.
03-10198 +++$+++ 691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Breyer, I agree.
03-10198 +++$+++ 692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And does anybody dispute that?
03-10198 +++$+++ 693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe --
03-10198 +++$+++ 694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that at issue here?
03-10198 +++$+++ 695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I believe the State might dispute that. I'm not sure. What the Michigan constitution does, Justice O'Connor, if I may come back to your question, is it says that for somebody who pleads guilty or nolo contendere, they are giving up the right to the automatic appeal, and they have -- they then have to proceed by the application for leave to appeal. And so the Michigan constitution explicitly still provides a right to appeal, but it changes the method. And so Michigan's appeal, after a guilty plea now, is like the first appeal in several other States, Virginia, West Virginia, and -- and several other States have guilty plea appeals.
03-10198 +++$+++ 696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's a strange terminology. It doesn't provide a right to appeal. It -- it provides a right to apply for an appeal, a right to ask for an appeal. A right to ask for an appeal is not a right to get an appeal.
03-10198 +++$+++ 697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's framed in terms of a -- of a right. Page 2 of the brief --
03-10198 +++$+++ 698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you have an absolute right to ask for an appeal.
03-10198 +++$+++ 699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's not a right to appeal. It's a right to request an appeal, which can be granted or denied.
03-10198 +++$+++ 701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
03-10198 +++$+++ 703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's a -- it's -- what Michigan has done is it has changed the method of the appeal. And so Virginia, for example, has first-tier appeals by petition. West Virginia has a first-tier by petition and --
03-10198 +++$+++ 704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's done more than change the method. It's changed the entitlement. The court can simply say we're not interested in your appeal. It doesn't raise a significant legal issue.
03-10198 +++$+++ 705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Scalia, but that's not how the -- the Michigan Court of Appeals works. The Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court. And so in Mr. Halbert's case, the Michigan Court of Appeals denied his appeal, after his futile attempt to -- to identify his issues, with an order saying that there was a lack of merit in the grounds presented. That is a preclusive decision on the merits of his case. That --
03-10198 +++$+++ 706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's just -- but that's just boiler plate, isn't it? That's what they say in all these cases.
03-10198 +++$+++ 707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I think Michigan cites a Michigan Supreme Court decision that says it's not on the merits.
03-10198 +++$+++ 709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That --
03-10198 +++$+++ 710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's People v. Berry?
03-10198 +++$+++ 711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. That was a decision of the Michigan Supreme Court referring to its own orders denying applications for leave to appeal which are not on the merits. The Michigan Supreme Court denies the applications for saying -- by saying, we are not persuaded that we should hear the questions presented.
03-10198 +++$+++ 712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, why wouldn't it be the same if the -- if it's a discretionary appeal at the intermediate appellate level?
03-10198 +++$+++ 713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because the Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, is an error-correcting court. And so it issues orders saying denied for lack of merit. And the Michigan Court of Appeals dozens and dozens of times in the last 25 years has said, without exception, that is a decision on the merits that precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine.
03-10198 +++$+++ 714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Didn't -- didn't the supreme court in the Bulger case -- was that the name of it?
03-10198 +++$+++ 715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Didn't it say that the -- that the intermediate court's denial of -- of appeals was a discretionary judgment?
03-10198 +++$+++ 717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It called it a discretionary appeal, Justice Scalia, without ever explaining why, and the -- the dissent in Bulger pointed out the Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court. And in fact, the very author of the --
03-10198 +++$+++ 718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That was a dissent, though.
03-10198 +++$+++ 719 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right, but the very author of the opinion in Bulger, Chief Justice Corrigan, just 1 year later or 2 years later describes the effect of -- of an order denying leave to appeal in the Michigan Court of Appeals, and says it clearly shows they considered and rejected the merits.
03-10198 +++$+++ 720 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So, in effect, it's discretionary in the sense that it's discretionary as to whether to give it full-dress treatment, but the bottom line, whether they give it full dress or -- or merely discretionary denial is -- is an implication on the merits.
03-10198 +++$+++ 721 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, exactly as in Virginia. In Jackson v. Virginia, the Court recognized that the -- the Virginia situation is exactly the same, that there is a petition to appeal to the Virginia Court of Appeals, and that each petition is considered on the merits, and a denial of the petition is seen as a decision on the merits that precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine. And so Michigan's appeal after a guilt plea now is exactly like the one in Virginia.
03-10198 +++$+++ 722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that something the intermediate appellate court has said? Have they said that, that -- we have a -- a discretionary appeal, but every -- in every case it's a merits decision? We don't have any decisions that say we are exercising our discretion not to review.
03-10198 +++$+++ 723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If a -- if a appeal or an application to the Michigan Court of Appeals is filed in the wrong form or is untimely or has some other defect, then the court will occasionally issue an order denying the application for that reason. But for any properly filed application for leave to appeal, the longstanding practice of the Michigan Court of Appeals is to say it is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented.
03-10198 +++$+++ 724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This means, I would presume, that -- that we would -- we would have to give -- our Federal courts on habeas would have to give deference to all decisions of the intermediate court since they're all on the merits.
03-10198 +++$+++ 725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And they do.
03-10198 +++$+++ 726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Federal courts do?
03-10198 +++$+++ 727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They assume that all factual and legal arguments have been decided against the -- the person applying for a discretionary appeal?
03-10198 +++$+++ 729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. After Abela v. Martin in the Sixth Circuit. And there is a -- a whole host of Federal district court decisions in the Eastern and Western District of Michigan all saying that when an order is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented, the AEDPA standard of review applies. And so the State obtains tremendous benefits from this procedure. They obtain deference on habeas corpus review. They prevent the indigent, if the indigent were to ever get a lawyer at some later stage, from beginning relitigation on State collateral review. And so the State very happily argues for all of those purposes that this is a decision on the merits, but then they come before this Court and they say, oh, no, it's not a decision on the merits. It's really discretionary despite what it says because they are hoping that this Court will conclude that it is a discretionary appeal. In fact, the State --
03-10198 +++$+++ 730 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Moran.
03-10198 +++$+++ 731 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- has made an even more radical argument in its brief. The State maintains that the appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal, and that is plainly contrary to the -- to the actual function of that court because there is a provision that if trial counsel suddenly realizes in a plea case, after sentencing, that there are issues that she should have raised, it allows her to do that. And so the State now argues that that's really the first-tier appeal, and then the application that follows after that to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal. I'll just point out that even the State's amicus doesn't agree with that, and -- and rightfully so in light of Swenson v. Bosler, which has rejected an attempt to reorganize by labeling how one's appeals go.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know what extraterritorial application means if it doesn't mean that, that a ship that is not in the United States is bound by United States law. What -- why isn't that extraterritorial application?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The reason, Justice Scalia, would be because the accommodation that was offered, that was entered into, and that began in the United States -- and -- and I would point out -- I think this is important to keep in mind --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What you're saying is it would -- I thought you were saying that it would be the enforcement of the domestic contract of which the -- the statutory provisions would be an implied term. Isn't that it?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Yes, that's correct.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It does not apply of its own force. It applies because two parties in the United States contracted that it would apply. Is that it?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. Now -- now, I -- I would just add that I think it -- you could characterize a public accommodation, you know, five nights lodging, for example. If that's entered into in the United States and -- and that begins in the United States, that a necessary term of that is nondiscrimination, and --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, then if you --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- if you have an ADA claim that governs that even if the discrimination occurred abroad, that would only relate to those things tied into the accommodation.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if you're on a round trip ticket from Liverpool to Miami and back, it would depend on where you bought the ticket.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, again, we -- we think that if accommodation begins here in the United States, that -- that a necessary term of that is nondiscrimination. Now, whether you characterize that as a contract claim or as a substantive application of the ADA, I'm not sure there's much of a difference.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but Justice Stevens' question is you buy the ticket in Liverpool. Is the ADA -- an -- an American buys the ticket in Liverpool to come to the United States.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To come to the United States.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is the ADA an applied term of that contract?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would -- I would assume not, although the question then would be whether or not it's a public accommodation that's been offered in the United States.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Don't -- don't all --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Even in U.S. waters? That wouldn't make sense. An American buys a ticket in -- in Liverpool. He's disabled. He goes to New York, Miami, New Orleans, and he's discriminated at -- at each step. No -- no coverage just because of where he bought the ticket?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no, Justice Kennedy, that's not our position. Let me -- let me try and be clear. We think that any vessel that comes into the internal waters and ports of the United States and offers a public accommodation or a specified public transportation service to our residents is subject to the ADA.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that means --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If -- if you had a situation -- I'm sorry.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, go ahead.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you had a situation where you had a ship that -- let's say, that began in -- in Great Britain and came here, it didn't pick up passengers here in the United States, I think that the better view would be, sure, United States law could apply to it because it's in our internal waters, but that as a substantive matter, with regard to the ADA, I don't know why that would be a public accommodation within the meaning of the ADA because it's not an accommodation that's offered --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But do you --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- or available to United States residents.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you agree with Mr. Goldstein that nothing turns on -- one might characterize this kind of cruise as U.S.-centered, but his answer was as long as they put in, a regular cruise stop, they pick up, they unload passengers, they take them back again on the ship, so long as they touch base at a U.S. port, letting off and picking up passengers, the ADA applies? Do you agree with that interpretation?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As I understand what Your Honor just said, I think that I would. Let me just clarify, though. We think the relevant question is whether that ship would -- has offered a public accommodation or a specified public transportation service --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This is my --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in the United States, and if the answer is yes --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let -- let me ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Goldstein. Even in the Cunard case, the prohibition case, they couldn't have liquor in the U.S. port, but when they leave and they go to Jamaica, they could pick up rum there. They could have liquor all the rest of the time so long as, when they enter and leave the U.S. port, they didn't have the liquor aboard. Here what you're saying is what goes in the -- for the New York port goes for every other place where this ship puts in.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, again, I -- not as a matter of -- not as a matter of extraterritorial application of U.S. law, but that is our position with regard to a public accommodation that begins in the United States. I -- I think the -- the important --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose it doesn't begin in the United States in that it -- it starts in, say, The Bahamas, and stops at --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I should probably should not have said begin, Your Honor. What I mean is if it -- if the public accommodation is provided for in the United States, that would be covered by the terms of the ADA, we think the ADA applies.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then you're saying exactly what everybody is worried about. I take it there is no way really for a ship to -- they either have the right door or they don't have the right door. And we're interested in the set of cases in which they're going to have to change their doors. And what I came in here thinking was we're talking about ships that pick up people and sail in Florida and sail around the Caribbean. That's the -- now, I've heard nothing but we're not talking just about those. We are talking about ships like I'm the last human being alive that went on a Swiss ship to Europe. Okay? (Laughter.)
03-1388 +++$+++ 3182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 50 years ago. And -- and we're talking about those ships, or we're talking about merchant ships that also say to the public, come as a passenger. Now, I would like to -- not what you're arguing. You're going to say, yes, we are arguing it. I want to know -- say something to relieve my concern about that set, which was Justice Ginsburg's concern. We are trying to rule the world in respect to those ships that only come here occasionally or it isn't a big part of their business, but they want to come to pick up American passengers.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. Sure. And what I would say with regard to that is that you're right that our broad view is that the ADA applies if that -- if they're offering public accommodation here in the United States. But if you reject that, I think there are several ways you could approach that. One would be to apply traditional choice-of-law factors that are -- that are applicable in maritime, and you could conclude, you know, based on sort of whether or not there are sufficient contacts here and whether or not --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you're saying that this is your position, but don't worry about it because we'll reject your position?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. He asked me to say something that -- that would -- would help his concerns. What I'm trying to say --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ One thing might be true, what you're not saying, is there really aren't very many of those ships, or another thing you might say, which you're not saying because maybe isn't true, is almost all of those ships that there are are already subject to tougher -- tougher rules, say, in Europe. But you don't say either of those.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. No --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Since you don't you say either of those, I think neither may be true.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't know the specific number. I would think that there are not many that the -- that this -- what you're concerned with primarily here are cruise ships that are in the business of providing public accommodations. But I would add as well -- and I think this is very important that the Court keep in mind -- that the clear statement rule, as it's -- as it's posited by respondent here, would not just apply to the ADA. It would apply to all U.S. laws, and that would include title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in its prohibition of racial discrimination, and I would find that that would be a remarkable construction.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It depends on what -- what kind of laws you're talking about. Laws that require the crew to be treated differently are -- are quite different from law -- laws that -- that require a passenger to be treated a certain way in the United States.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, you're correct, and that's precisely why they have --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And laws -- laws that require structural alteration of a ship are quite different from laws that say while you're in United States waters, you won't discriminate on the basis of race.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If -- two -- two responses, if I may, Your Honor. And that is, if you -- if that is the conclusion you reach, then you still need to remand this case because there are an awful number of claims that are precisely those kinds of claims that the Fifth Circuit would not allow. Secondly, I think you're wrong with regard to the scope of the clear statement requirement. There is no requirement that you have to have a clear statement to apply a U.S. law to a foreign vessel. There is only a requirement that you need a clear statement if the conduct at issue would relate only to the internal matters of that vessel. And here you're dealing with public accommodation --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If we haven't expressed it yet, we ought to express it then.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I disagree, Your Honor. And what I would point you to is -- is that the long -- every time this Court has spoken with regard to the clear statement requirement relating to foreign-flagged ships, it has referred to the internal order doctrine. And that is embodied in a number of bilateral agreements that go back for centuries. The -- the treaty that was at issue in the Wildenhus's Case expressly said that if the -- if the conduct did not relate to members of the crew but to passengers or other members of the port state or otherwise affected the interests of the port state, that the port state law would apply. And that is the general rule. The international regime that governs this area by its terms provide minimum standards and leaves it available to port states and to flag states to add additional requirements. That would mean --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Salmons, one of the alternatives you threw out, not as a response to clear statement, but as a -- a response to the issue that was being raised by it, was the provision of the statute that it was intended to exercise the -- the fullest extent of the -- of the commerce power. And The -- The Bahamas respond to that by saying you could have said exactly -- or argued exactly the same thing in McCulloch. What is your response to that?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I would disagree with that on -- on a couple of respects. The first is that the definition of commerce here is broader than it was and specifically refers to travel between the United States and foreign countries. The only other statute we're aware of that says that is title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In addition --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, may I just ask you a -- a factual question? I didn't go back to the text to check this. Does the text of this statute say in these words basically we are exercising the fullest possible extent of the commerce power?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Justice Souter. What -- what the text of the statute says --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it's not in McCulloch.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. What the text of this statute says is that -- in fact, this is the definition of commerce that relates only to title III of ADA. And it says precisely that it includes travel between foreign countries and the United States and that Congress was intending to -- to reach the full sweep of its -- its constitutional authority.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Salmons. Mr. Frederick.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3204 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case is about congressional intent not congressional power. Congress undoubtedly has the power --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could you address the last point?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. It was not the fullest extent of the commerce power. That statute was at issue in this Court's case concerning the Lanham Act where the Court said that a violation of the Lanham Act that occurred in Mexico but had an effect in the United States was intended to be covered by Congress because that commerce clause, Justice Souter, did state to the fullest extent of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. This statute does not say that. This statute talks about commerce in and between States and territories, and it is much closer to the statute language that this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case where --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it -- it doesn't have the fullest extent language then.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. That's correct.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How does it compare to title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there are slight differences in the language, but I don't think that's dispositive because title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case, the Court -- the Chief Justice's opinion there said that that language was not enough to express the intent.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So that would be the same for title II, which is the public accommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So I take it that you are saying that on these foreign-flagged vessels, just as the ADA would be inapplicable, so title II, the public accommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, would be inapplicable.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's all a question of congressional intent, Justice Ginsburg, and there's no indication of an intent that Congress needed to address any problem that arose with respect to that form of discrimination.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So your -- but your answer is, there being no such indication, that a ship putting in at a U.S. port was free to discriminate among its passengers on the basis of race.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there would be no U.S. congressional statute that would address that, Justice Ginsburg. There would be a violation of the Bahamian constitution which prohibits --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm asking about the U.S. law and policy which says no segregation, no discrimination in places of public accommodation.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As I said, I'm not aware that there has ever been an instance of that in the cruise industry. Congress has not addressed that. We're talking about foreign ships here. And I want to get back to the structural features of the ship because the ADA fundamentally --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but this is a good question, and what is your position? That the ship could engage in racial discrimination while in U.S. ports on the selling of tickets and the provision of accommodations while in U.S. ports and within the 3 --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice O'Connor, our position is that Congress has not spoken to the question, and so there is no congressional statute that is on point.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then your answer, I take it, is yes, it can discriminate and it can discriminate because Congress has not told it not to. Is that it?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. No. Our position is that it can't discriminate because a different law proscribes that --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So far as United States law is concerned, it could.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the same answer for 1981?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, as I said, Congress has not extended its laws to the full reach of U.S. territorial power, and this Court has maintained that position ever since the Charming Betsy case 200 years ago, The Schooner Exchange case, and Brown v. Duchesne.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let's put it this way. So my understanding of your answer is that we could write an opinion ruling for you but leaving these other questions open? I don't see how we can do that.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What you say, Justice Kennedy, is that the clear statement canon requires Congress to say when it intends to apply a law to a foreign vessel. Congress didn't do that.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if I'm writing the opinion and I put that down and rule for you, it seems to me that I then answered necessarily Justice Ginsburg's question in the negative.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You do, Justice Kennedy. And just as this Court in the ARAMCO case said that title VII doesn't apply to the foreign -- work in a foreign land by an American company of an American --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But these --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, Congress hasn't extended criminal laws of the United States to the full reach of U.S. power. It is only proscribed 15 offenses that will apply in the special maritime jurisdiction.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Frederick, this is -- this is what concerns me about your answer. I know that Mr. Goldstein took the position that it doesn't matter what kind of operation this is, but the operation that we're dealing with, it sells tickets mainly to -- what percentage of its passengers are from the USA?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Approximately two-thirds to three-quarters in any given year.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And does it normally start the voyage and end it in U.S. ports?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The majority of them do.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And how much of its advertising budget is pitched at U.S. customers?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, there -- all of those questions are going to be answered as a predominant marketing effort, et cetera is directed to the U.S. market.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, this is the anomaly. You're asking us to buy an interpretation. An enterprise is U.S.-centered in terms of where it gets its business and that enterprise, nonetheless, is not bound by what is our bedrock anti-discrimination law both with regard to customers, passengers, and employment.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the reason, Justice Ginsburg, is that that law imposes structural changes on vessels that go to other ports.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why don't you -- why don't you try to draw that line? Why don't you say that just as the applicability or not may depend upon whether you're dealing with a crew of a foreign ship or whether you're dealing with an American who happens to be injured on board that ship, so also it may depend upon whether the anti-discrimination law in question is one that at least in some of its applications requires structural changes or not? That would enable you to say the ADA doesn't apply, but would not compel you to say that title II doesn't apply.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We are talking --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're not willing to take such a limited position.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, I think the Court could certainly carve out in its clear -- articulation of the clear statement principle some of these lines. It becomes very --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the ADA itself makes an exception for things that aren't readily achievable. I mean, you could certainly lean on that because a structural change probably isn't readily achievable.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice O'Connor, Congress, when it talked about readily achievable, did so in terms of cost. It didn't do so in terms of conflict with the laws of other nations or --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there -- is there -- I mean, you're giving me the answer I thought the other side would give me. All right? And I appreciate it actually. (Laughter.)
03-1388 +++$+++ 3246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You say that two-thirds of these people, the customers, are American. So we're dealing with a business that is primarily American, not a business like the Swiss ship except with the exceptional cases. Then you say, all right, still it's a problem because of structural changes we'll have to make. What changes? That is to say, I would have thought I could have read, but I haven't, that other countries like Europe also have discrimination laws against disabled people, and therefore, given that fact and given the document that Mr. Goldstein produced, it is highly unlikely that your clients will have to make any significant structural change that they wouldn't have had to make anyway.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, what's the response to that?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's completely false. In -- in the year 2000, the United States Government issued a report that contained an extensive appendix, which we've cited in our brief, that details in laborious detail the conflicts between land-based ADA standards and SOLAS. Now, I can give you some specifics, if you would -- that are fairly practical, such as the ADA requires under the interpretation advanced by the petitioners that there be a disabled access cabin on every level of the ship, but SOLAS requires that passengers with disabilities be placed near evacuation points.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why -- why can't you just fight that battle by battle on what's reasonably achievable? Because in order to avoid that problem, what you're telling us is that a cruise line can charge a -- a disabled person double the price --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As a matter of fact --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- because they're a nuisance. And that's your position.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, as a matter of fact, we categorically deny the claims of discrimination here. We're having to fight this on the basis of assuming the -- the allegations are true, but they are categorically false. And --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it doesn't matter what you want to do as a matter of good will. The question is what the law requires you to do, and you're saying it's up to us, we govern. You're not governed by U.S. anti-discrimination law.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, what the other side wants is a case-by-case method of decision-making in which a district judge becomes the special master of the cruise industry so that each claim of discrimination that would require some modification to the ship --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That happens to every employer under -- in the United States under the reasonably achievable standard.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's why, Justice Kennedy, it's a question of congressional intent. The very same Congress debated extensively about whether to impose design requirements on foreign ships in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and it decided to buck the international system knowingly by imposing a design requirement that double hulls be imposed on oil tankers, foreign oil tankers.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Frederick, that brings up a question I've been meaning to ask you. To what extent was this whole problem of the application of this statute to the foreign vessels discussed in the legislative history of these statutes?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Zero. There is not one word about vessel --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. If -- if that's so and if you look at the earlier cases -- but all I could get out it is that those earlier cases -- the Court tries to do what it really would have thought Congress would have intended in the circumstances. And if that's so, why wouldn't Congress really have intended that a business that's two-thirds American has to abide by American law?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because it was encroaching on an area of foreign sovereignty. Foreign ships are governed by foreign laws.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does -- does Britain -- or does Britain or does the European Union, for example, forbid you to charge this double price?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does European law -- I'd be surprised if it doesn't forbid it, but do you know?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I don't know the answer to European law on charging of an additional price, but I would point out that pricing, like evacuation procedures, do go to the structure of the vessel. And we're talking here fundamentally in the ADA about structural changes that they want to impose that go -- when ships travel, they can't dismantle those structural changes when they leave U.S. waters.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. -- may I ask this question to you? What about a -- an American-flagged ship? Does the statute apply or not?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the Fifth Circuit reserved that question.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is your view?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Our view is that there are arguments that can be made that it does not because Congress didn't --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is your view? Not what arguments can be made. What is your view?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think -- (Laughter.)
03-1388 +++$+++ 3272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I think our view is that it doesn't.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does not apply.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does not apply because Congress didn't express the intent.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So really, we're not concerned with the fact this is a foreign-flagged ship. You're concerned with the fact it's a ship.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- there's a difference and -- and there are about 1,000 U.S.-flagged ships that carry passengers, so that if Congress had given any thought to the question, it is reasonable to suppose it might have distinguished between U.S. ships for which U.S. law directly governs and foreign ships that are governed by a different law. The fact --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we need -- do we need a clear statement for United States ships? I thought your case rested on a clear statement requirement. Is there any clear statement requirement for U.S. ships?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, Justice Scalia.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So why -- why isn't there a clear difference between the two?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because there aren't any words in the statute that go to ships. The best they can do is a catchall phrase at the end of bus, rail, and any other means of conveyance.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's pretty good, isn't it?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's not -- (Laughter.)
03-1388 +++$+++ 3283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you don't require a clear statement, that's -- that's good enough, it seems to me.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your -- your case hangs on the fact that, you know, when Congress wants to -- to rule the world and say all ships in the -- in the world that touch at our ports have to have this kind of a thing, it says so clearly. It doesn't have to say so with perfect clarity with respect to American ships.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With respect to foreign ships, there is a clear statement rule and that clear statement rule is embodied in the fact that a foreign ship is governed by the law of the flag state where it is registered. That's been the rule for 200 years. And the other side's position --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, is that limited, though, just to things that affect the internal order of the ship? Is that the context in which we've articulated that rule?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's been articulated in several different contexts. In the Brown v. Duchesne case, the Court 150 years ago articulated in a patent case where the Court said that a patented device on the ship, which was the French ship in Boston Harbor infringing an American patent-holder, would not apply U.S. patent law. And the Court said, because we can't conceive that Congress would have imagined this general language to encroach on the sovereignty of a foreign ship. Now, the other side has exactly two sentences to say about that case, but that is the case that is directly on point because that case says that when you are dealing with American laws that are generally written, you would not ordinarily apply them to a foreign ship unless Congress said so specifically.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but in that case, there was -- as I understand it, there was no legal relationship of any sort between the supplier of the patent-infringing object and the ship in the United States. So it at least made sense to classify that with internal order as opposed to external relationships arguably involving -- or implicating American law. You've got exactly the opposite situation here. You've got contracts made in the United States with the foreign cruise line. You didn't have that in your patent case.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Souter, you have a foreign ship owned by a foreign corporation built in a foreign country under foreign engineering standards --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With its principal place of business in the United States.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ For a time before that ship moves into another market.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But its significant external -- its significant commercial relationships are in the United States with people in the United States performed partially in the United States.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In just the same way that McCulloch the Court said that labor standards for a course of business that is regular between Honduras and the United States is not going to be sufficient to apply --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The crew members were Honduran in that case.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They were.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This -- if you just look at it, suppose you were not a lawyer and you look at this operation. You'd say that's got USA written all over it. The passengers are from the USA. The company is centered in Florida. And then you have this flag of convenience that it flies which can legitimately govern the relationship with its crew. But to say that it governs the relationship with passengers, it seems to me very strange. And also the ticket says, passenger, if you're going to sue us, it's got to be in the United States and under U.S. law to boot.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But a choice-of-law clause, Justice Ginsburg, has never been held to incorporate law in the sense that laws that don't apply are going to be incorporated. I'm not aware of any choice-of-law clause that -- that simply takes in every domestic statute.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3300 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Just -- it's just one other indicia that one looks at this operation and says this belongs to the USA. A practical judgment, I think, would come down there.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3301 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and you would have -- under their theory, you would have the Consumer Products Safety Act, the Food and Drug Act, OSHA, all sorts of other statutes of general application that are now going to be imposed on foreign vessels simply because they do a lot of business in the United States. The problem here, as a matter of congressional intent, is we don't know what Congress thought about this, and because Congress --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we -- we do -- we do have the rule if it -- if it applies to the internal operations of the ship, and so far as the crew is concerned, the Jones Act and OSHA, it seems to me, may well be governed by the law of the flag.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the internal operations of the ship, Justice Kennedy, is part and parcel of how it is designed, what are the evacuation points, how are the cabins laid out, what ramps are placed where, how -- everything about the ship's design --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a part of the case I'm not sure about, and it seems to me, again, it can be fought out under the reasonably achievable --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't -- Justice Kennedy, the problem with that theory is it just doesn't comport with the language of -- of the statute. Congress didn't think in terms of -- as it did in the Oil Pollution Act, it said, if there's a conflict with international law, work it out. Get the Coast Guard with the foreign nations and work out the conflict. It didn't put anything like that in this statute, which is a further indication that if Congress wants to extend this kind of disability protection, it can do that, but it ought to do so willingly. And the Government has had 13 years to come up with rules that would govern cruise ships, and the best they've done, a few days before the top-side briefs in this case were filed, is to issue proposed draft guidelines for ferries, not cruise ships. Most of the regulations that they are pointing to wouldn't have an application to a large passenger cruise ship. If Congress wants to change this, it certainly has the power, but this Court need not open up a Pandora's box of domestic legislation to apply to foreign ships where Congress has not expressed the intent to do that.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could you go back to Justice Breyer's question about the number of foreign ships? Once we get beyond cruise lines, does it -- would -- would the -- the application on your view cover the -- the dozen passengers who decide they want to take a trip on a -- on a cargo boat?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I don't perceive a limiting principle to the other side's position. In fact, there's an amicus brief written where there's only one or two stops in the United States a year, and under their view, that ship would be governed by the ADA as well. If -- if Congress wants to enact these limits, it's certainly free to do so, but this is a highly complex area and ships are different from land-based accommodations because you have to be able to evacuate people within 30 minutes. And so when we train people, we have --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But doesn't it -- on the other -- on the other side of the coin, apart from the structural problem -- and I understand the arguments on both sides there. With respect to things like safety drills and access to gambling tables and all that, it seems to me that your answer to that would be, well, we'll just do that once we're on the high seas so there's no conflict with the statute when we're out there.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As a matter of fact, Justice Stevens, we give evacuation drills to the disabled in a different way. We have special access and assistance squads that go to persons with physical challenges to get them off the vessel in an event of a -- a need for evacuation. That's a different procedure than most passengers, but it's -- it is one that is in place.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Garre.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3312 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Applying title III of the Americans With Disabilities Act to foreign-flagged vessels would invite precisely the sort of international discord, conflict, and confusion that Congress presumably seeks to avoid when it writes American laws.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you agree with Mr. Frederick's answer about title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? I mean, a lot of countries don't prohibit discrimination.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, first let me make clear that the Bahamian Government does and all of its cruise vessels are governed by that prohibition.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm asking about the application of U.S. law.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We think that that question can be resolved along the lines that Justice Scalia suggested, which is that when you're dealing with a matter that goes to the internal affairs of the ship -- and there -- we would suggest that there is more central to the internal affairs of the ship than its construction and design. Under international law, article 94 of the Law of -- Law of the Sea Convention, which the Bahamian Government has ratified -- and by the way, the United States has not, and that's an important principle for this Court to keep in mind -- foreign-flagged states may be bound by different international treaties than the United States. So simply trying to draw some conflict resolution device that would deal with treaties that the United States has entered into, international nations have not will not address that problem.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So before you go on to that, I want to be clear on your answer to title II of the Civil Rights Act of '64. There's -- you say, well, that's easier to comply with. But that's not the principle under which you're operating.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. With respect, Justice Ginsburg, our principle is that when it comes to the matters that under international law have been traditionally governed by the flag state, then when Congress writes its laws, we presume that unless Congress clearly indicates an affirmative intention to address those matters, it did not intend to. When Congress wrote the ADA, not a word of the statute indicates that it considered the international repercussions of applying that law to foreign-flagged vessels. Not a word --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What about the -- what about the full sweep argument? Let's sort of come full circle on that. You -- you say the full sweep argument is no good because the same thing could have been made in McCulloch. The response was there is a textual difference --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's -- what's the full sweep argument? I don't --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Full sweep of the commerce power.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, first of all, it's -- it -- the statute doesn't say full sweep. It says sweep, and that's in the findings of the ADA. It's reprinted on page 32 of petitioners' brief. And second of all, the definition of Congress, which doesn't contain that sweep language, is almost identical to the definition of commerce in McCulloch, which is on page 15, note 3 of that decision, and that definition, the United States argued in the McCulloch case, was not sufficient to extend U.S. labor laws to foreign-flagged vessels. It's important to understand the -- the potential international conflicts that extending the ADA to foreign-flagged vessels could create. There are more than 40 nations that have adopted anti-discrimination laws for the disabled. Three nations have -- have adopted laws for domestic vessels: Britain, Canada, and Australia. If a country like the United States extended its laws to foreign vessels that entered its ports, then other nations may well follow suit. And if you take a simple hypothetical example, the Queen Mary II traveling from South Hampton to New York, if you look at the guidelines that Britain has adopted for domestic vessels, those guidelines contain different structural and design requirements than the draft guidelines that the United States have promulgated. There are different requirements for door widths. There are different requirements for sloping. There's different requirements for the watertight compartments. There are different requirements about whether vessels have to be -- have accessible cabins all throughout the ship.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ When you say different, you mean you cannot comply with both.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that what you mean? Or -- or are those just minimums and -- and the United States would -- would comply with those minimums?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, I think in some you could and in others you couldn't. And -- and that's an important -- important point.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And incidentally just for the -- are -- this ship has -- these are regulations that help the disabled?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor. And -- and in many cases, it's not going to be clear which regulation is going to be more accommodating to the disabled and which is not.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could they work that out? That is, if two-thirds of our universe really is American-based, in terms of customers, and we're now only talking about conflicts in -- real conflicts that -- that affect, say, one-third of the universe, that's also true in areas like antitrust or others where the enforcement authorities get together and they try to write memoranda that -- that work this out in a reasonable way. Could -- could the same thing happen here if such real conflicts did emerge?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We don't think so, Justice Breyer.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We would take the same approach that this Court emphasized in -- in the McCulloch case, which is that kind of ad hoc balancing analysis would wreak havoc for the question whether a significant regulation like the ADA would apply to a vessel. How would foreign vessels know, when they enter U.S. ports, whether they have to undertake the extraordinary changes --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The answer would be yes, you do. You do have to, and then if there's some other authority that wants to get involved in this, the two authorities would work it out.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, the way that those issues are worked out in the international shipping context is through the International Maritime Organization. This organization has been responsible for crafting scores of conventions, hundreds of shipping codes, and it's already begun to address the issue of accessibility on ships for the disabled and the elderly. We cite the 1996 guidelines in our brief. Those guidelines right now are -- are not binding guidelines, but they could well become binding guidelines. And when an organization like the IMO addresses this question, it resolves --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's perfect because then the Government says that once it becomes a matter of binding international rule, anything that conflicts with that will be viewed as not reasonably achievable. So all you have to do is that and then there's no longer a problem with American law, according to them.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we don't think the readily achievable language in the first case in any way contemplates conflicts with international law. This Court has a separate canon that's almost as old as the country that it presumes Congress doesn't intend to interfere with international obligations or international laws, including customary international law, as you wrote for the Court last term in -- in the Empagran case. We presume that American legislatures give respect to the interests of sovereign nations when they write their laws, and we don't assume that Congress intends to intrude on the sovereign interests of other nations. And that's what extending the ADA to foreign-flagged ships would do. The Bahamian Government has a solemn responsibility under international law and under its own law to govern the construction and design of all flags of all ships that fly -- fly its flags. Article 10 of the Geneva Convention on the High Seas recognizes that flag states have responsibility for the construction and design of ships. Article 94 of the Law of the Sea Conventions specifies that flag states have responsibility over administrative, technical, and labor matters, including construction and design matters. These are precisely the sorts of matters that for centuries the flag state has been responsible for. And in the Brown v. Duchesne case, this Court recognized that, a case that dealt with the application of patent laws to the construction and design of a foreign-flagged vessels. There are going to be conflicts within -- between international law and the requirements of the ADA, but first of all, there's going to be confusion. It's been more than a decade since the ADA was passed, and we don't even have final regulations as to what rules apply. And in the meantime, foreign-flagged vessels are going to have to be reviewing the case law in the United States courts, determining on a vessel-by-vessel, design specification-by-design specification as to what standards apply. That's only going to create additional international discord and confusion. Petitioners proposed solution to this problem we think is telling. They urge this Court in their reply brief if there is a problem after the ADA is extended to foreign-flagged ships and other nations begin to follow suit and you have a crazy made -- maze of different regulations applying to construction and design, then at that point, the United States can go to the IMO and ask it to clean up the mess. With respect, we think they have it backwards. The purpose of the IMO and the international framework that exists for governing regulation of shipping is to establish a uniform set of rules in the first instance. The IMO has already begun to address the problem at issue in this case, accessibility for the disabled. They are available to address that in a multilateral fashion. And Congress, in enacting the ADA, gave no indication that it weighed any of the international repercussions of the action that petitioners urges the case -- petitioners urge the Court to take in this case. And we would urge this Court to return this matter to Congress. Congress is in the position to weigh the risk of international confusion, to weigh the potential for international discord and to address those matters as it sees -- sees fit. If there are no further questions.

03-1388 +++$+++ 3339 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. GOLDSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg, our position is the one that can accommodate your concerns. Theirs cannot. Just like in Empagran, where this Court built in comity considerations, relying on cases like Lauritzen that involved foreign-flagged ships, it said, look, even if the text of the Sherman Act or the FTAIA could literally reach it, in these cases that we don't think Congress could have conceived of, we're not going to apply the statute. But here, we have a situation in which this company has 95 percent of its cruises going in and out from the United States. Millions of people, and billions of dollars in commerce are affected by this statute and Americans that Congress had to have in mind.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Goldstein. The case is submitted.

03-1395 +++$+++ 3346 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case, like the Totten case almost 130 years ago, is at bottom an effort by alleged spies to obtain additional compensation for services rendered.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, do you take the position that the Federal Government couldn't enforce any provision of such an agreement either?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. That's correct, Justice O'Connor, with respect to the kind of espionage arrangements and contracts we're talking about.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, suppose -- suppose somebody, allegedly a former spy, is alleged to -- by the Government to have breached the agreement by writing and publishing a tell-all book about it.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice O'Connor, I think that actually points up the important differences between the way that the CIA deals with its employees and the way that it deals with its espionage agents like respondents are alleged to be.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, okay.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With respect to espionage agents --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would the Government be without any recourse if it was an alleged espionage agent?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe that's true, Justice O'Connor, because the espionage agents do not sign prepublication review agreements. They do not receive formal security clearances the way that an employee does. And unlike an employee, they do not have access to a broad swath of classified information that raises attendant counterintelligence concerns. And so if you think about the course of dealing that the agency has with its employees, the employees are able to sue the agency in court under, for example, title VII, and the agency can turn around and sue their employees to enforce things like the prepublication review agreement that was issue -- at issue in this Court's Snepp decision. So in the employment context, I think it's very difficult to say that there's an implied term of the employment contract that either side will not have judicial recourse.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what if the employment contract is with an American citizen to act as an espionage agent and nobody else knew about it. Would -- would that -- would he be treated as an espionage agent or as an employee?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If I understand your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, I think that individual would be treated as an espionage agent if it's just somebody for sort of a one-off assignment. And I think that -- that is illustrated by this Court's decision in Totten. I mean, William Lloyd, for example, was a U.S. citizen. He agreed with President Lincoln to engage in espionage activities in the south. And this Court held that when the estate of -- of Mr. Lloyd came to seek compensation from a court, that there was no judicial remedy to enforce that alleged agreement, and the remedy, if any, lay with the President's contingent fund.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I'd like your help on this. Your interpretation of Totten -- does it say that there is just no actionable contract, or does it say there's no jurisdictions like political question? I mean, you win under any of those theories, if we accept them. But which is it?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Kennedy, it's a difficult question to answer because I think there are a lot of different strains underlying the Totten decision, and I think there is --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but you need to get to whether there is -- do you urge dismissal for lack of jurisdiction in the district court or a dismissal on the merits? It's not clear to me at all.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice O'Connor, I think it's better understood as simply a rule of dismissal, that it's not really a pure jurisdictional defect. It's been referred alternatively as a jurisdictional bar or as a rule of dismissal, and of course, as this Court reminded us recently in the Kontrick decision, people tend to use terms like jurisdiction loosely in these contexts.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'm -- I'm not going away with a clear idea of your position.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do I -- do I -- does the Government file under 12(b)(1) like a jurisdiction, 12(b)(6), no cause of action? Of course, you'd probably do both, but I -- I want to know --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- what your best thinking is of what Totten means. It seems to me that this just means that there can be no contract formed under these circumstances.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, I think the general practice of the Government is to file under both. I believe that's what happened here. I think the fact that we file under both suggests that there is a little bit of confusion about it. I would tend to agree with you it's better understood as a rule of dismissal under 12(b)(6) because if you think about the Totten decision, there's really two strains to the decision. One is a recognition that the claim to relief necessarily depends on a fact that the law has always regarded as secret, and in a sense that case simply can't proceed. And that's very analogous to this Court's holding in Weinberger against Catholic Action. There's a second strain to the case, though, and that is that the very idea of walking into court and filing the action is inconsistent with an implied term of the contract or, indeed, the whole nature of the espionage relationship. And I think particularly if you emphasize that second strain of the Totten decision, I think it's better understood as a 12(b)(6) dismissal because what you're really saying is somebody is walking into court and they are effectively pleading themselves out of court because as -- if you look at this complaint here, it starts out with a recitation of the fact that these individuals allegedly engaged in espionage activities and that they were denied certain promises that were made to them after they carried out, quote, their end of the bargain.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If there's no cause of action, there's nothing to -- to claim on, what's -- what's the closest analogy? Is it like a promise to make a gift, which is unenforceable? Is there kind of a contract analogy that we can use?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I mean, I -- you know, one -- one way of thinking about it, but I think it's a very rough analogy, is it's almost like an unlawful contract. It's a contract that the law just doesn't recognize. And I think that -- that reflects the underlying reality of these cases, which is there is something inherent in an espionage relationship that when you enter an espionage relationship, you understand that you have no protected status under the law. I think that has, with respect, been clear in the -- not just in the Totten decision but from the very beginning of the republic. I mean, ever since Nathan Hale agreed to cross British lines as a spy, it was understood that he had no legal recourse, that he had a status that was not recognized at the law. And I think that is -- it has always been thus, and I think there is no reason to revisit the --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does -- does that mean -- the no legal recourse at all mean that you could torture an agent if you were dissatisfied with his work performance?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I don't believe that's true, Justice Stevens, and what I would distinguish is between a constitutional claim that an -- an agent -- an alleged agent might have that doesn't depend on the espionage relationship. As I would understand your question, I mean, it would -- there would be a -- a substantive due process claim that anybody could bring if the Government tortured them. They wouldn't have to allege that I had a secret espionage relationship with the Government and then they tortured me. That would be irrelevant to their claim.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could I -- could I bring you back to your -- your earlier discussion of a spy who is also a -- a Government employee? Are you telling me that he -- he cannot sue for his regular salary simply because the work he was doing was -- was espionage? I mean, he's -- he's a GS-whatever, GS-16, and the Government just doesn't send him his monthly check.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He has no recourse for that check just because he's been doing spy work?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3374 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, that's not the position, and -- and I -- and I apologize if I gave that impression in answering Justice Stevens' hypothetical. I understood to be the hypothetical that you had a Government employee who engaged in a separate spy endeavor, if you will, and then tried to sue to collect on the damages owed under that -- for that particular endeavor.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3375 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, not -- not for his regular GS salary.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3376 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. My -- my hypothetical was an individual who's not a Government employee but is hired by the Government to engage in espionage activities.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Exactly. And as I indicated to you earlier, Justice Stevens -- that in a sense that's not a hypothetical. That's the Totten decision itself. William Lloyd was -- or at least alleged that he was employed by President Lincoln to engage in those services. And in answer to Justice Scalia's question, if William Lloyd happened to be an employee of the -- of the Comptroller of Currency or something, he could still sue to get whatever remedies he had --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He couldn't get the 5,000 bonus for being a spy. Right?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly right. No bonus dollars for being a spy under those circumstances.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could you clarify on the employment question something else? It's -- it's in your reply brief and you say you're contrasting this type of claim with a title VII claim which -- in which you say that the Court in Webster relied on the CIA's historical practice of litigating employment disputes. The CIA's historical practice, not the Court's rulings. Are you suggesting that even with respect to employment litigation, it's up to the CIA to decide what its practice will be?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that the reason that -- that I think that the Government would have had almost no ability to invoke a Totten-type defense in Webster or in a title VII case is because of its course of dealing with its employees. And I suppose that if the agency completely changed its course of dealing with respect to its employees or entered a very different course of dealing with certain select employees, then a Totten defense might become available in those circumstances. But as I indicated earlier, I think if you look at the overall nature of the agency's relationship and rights vis-a-vis its employees, even its covert ones, that's a very different relationship than the agency has with respect to espionage agents. And again, that's because they enter contracts with them. Each side has certain litigation rights, and I think it would be a bit of a stretch for the Government to come in and say that there's an implied term of that employment agreement that forecloses a judicial remedy.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I guess the Government can't enforce -- cannot enforce these contracts either. Right? I mean, you take the good with the -- the bad with the good?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly right, Justice Scalia.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You've never sued a spy to -- who hasn't carried out his mission?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Certainly not -- I'm not aware of such a suit, and I've been told by the agency that it's impossible. And I think it just reflects the nature of these agreements, and it does -- it --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can -- can we go back to the -- another threshold question? You did press below and Judge Tallman urged that the reason this case can't be in the district court in California, or wherever, is it has to be in the Federal Circuit. This is a contract claim against the Government. Are you abandoning that position?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in fact we have abandoned it. We abandoned that position at the cert stage. We made that clear to the Court in our certiorari papers, and we don't renew any type of jurisdictional objection at this stage.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are you free -- are you free to abandon it? Is the -- is the Government's surrender of its immunity from suit for contracts, provided that the suit is brought in the Federal Circuit -- is that something that you are free -- Congress having said that, that the executive is free to say, well, we could take advantage of that, but we don't want to?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I think the answer to that is that it probably is jurisdictional in the pure sense and so if this Court disagreed with our view that there wasn't a Tucker Act problem, this Court could reach that issue and send the case back on the Tucker Act grounds. So maybe I could explain to you why it is that we think that there's not a Tucker Act problem, at least at this stage of the litigation. The Ninth Circuit's reasoning on this was a little bit oblique, but as I understand it, there were two parts to it. First of all, that there might be some kind of substantive due process claim here that did not depend on the contract but rather somehow stemmed from the fact that there was some endangerment of these individuals and that gave rise to some substantive due process right. And even if that claim, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, is not one that is formed on the contract or an implied contract, it seems to me that that's a claim that's clearly within the coverage of the Totten doctrine because it is inherent in the espionage relationship that the individual will be engaged in a -- in a situation where they will be endangered. And I think that was certainly true of William Lloyd in the Totten case. When he crossed southern lines, he was very much endangered, and that's something that wasn't lost on President Lincoln. In footnote 3 of our opening brief, we have a quotation from President Lincoln about the inherent dangers of spies crossing lines and the need for secrecy to protect that. So that's why I think that claim is properly understood as not being covered by the Tucker Act and not being required to be brought in the Court of Claims, but nonetheless a claim that is barred by the Totten doctrine. The other point they made was with respect to the specific regulations that the agency has internally, and they suggest that there might be a claim here that was based on the regulations independent of the contract. But in order for that claim to go forward, the Court would have to examine the unredacted version of the regulations. And even if the Court is right that there's a need for further proceedings on that question, it makes no sense to interpret the doctrine in a way that requires the Government to wait to assert a Totten defense until there is a jurisdictional question cleared up that actually requires discovery because I think what Totten recognized is -- is there is a need to dismiss the claim at the outset before any discovery because of the nature of the suit. So for those two reasons, we thought that the -- that the better view was that the Tucker Act problem was either not presented because of the substantive due process claim or not ripe and that we would pursue the Totten act.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that would make a lot of sense if you really felt that what Totten is is -- is a dismissal on the merits, just saying there's -- there's no contractual claim. I -- I mean, if you didn't believe that, if -- if you believed that what Totten says is we have no jurisdiction, then we'd have no problem and we could resolve all of the questions. But it seems to me if you believe that Totten is based mainly -- you know, it's a contract case and said the contract is just totally invalid, we shouldn't be reaching the contract issue. We should simply say that if -- if we agree with you, that there's no substantive due process claim here and -- and no claim based on the regulations. How do we get the authority to decide the -- the contract question?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think whatever the status the contract question has, whether it's 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), I think it's a -- it's a threshold issue and I think this Court under the Rohrgas authority can reach that issue at the outset. And I think it would be particularly perplexing to have a doctrine that said that when we have a suit that we know on the face of the complaint cannot be brought in any court, that we are going to not reach that issue in favor of trying to determine first which court it properly belongs in, when that inquiry in fact will get us into the exact classified information that we know at the outset the suit should not involve in the first place. And I think there is enough flexibility in this Court's Rohrgas decision to allow the Court to reach that threshold question first.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you're saying that if there's no contract, then there's no substantive liberty to protect under the -- under due process procedures.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I think that follows, Justice Kennedy. I think one of the difficulties with the constitutional theory that's advanced on the other side is it gives -- it seeks a right to enforce internal procedural handling mechanisms for claims that we know there's no legitimate expectation for their enforcement at all. And it seems odd that this would develop in a way where the procedural rights somehow trump the substantive rights, and we know from Totten that there is no substance here that can be brought forward in the courts. I think in this respect it is also important to recognize that, as a practical matter, an agent who's negotiating in the shadow of the Totten decision and the broader understanding that Totten reflects is likely to seek assurances not just about compensation but about how -- how their claims would be heard by the CIA and how they're going to get their compensation. And I think there's no particular reason to think procedural assurances should be judicially enforceable when the substantive assurances are not. Now, one other point to make about the nature of these agreements. Not only because of the nature of these agreements does the agency end up in a position where it cannot enforce these contracts itself through judicial actions, but it also ends up in a situation where it may have to give up-front payments that it otherwise wouldn't have to give and the like. So there are consequences to both sides of dealing in this way with these espionage relationships as effectively outside the law. But again, it has always been thus, and I think there is no principle in -- in any recent development that requires this Court to revisit the rule of Totten which, as I said, suggests an -- it reflects an understanding that date backs -- dates back much further. If I can make one other point, which is I think even though the Totten decision reflects something more than the state secrets privilege, because there's a more fundamental defect with a suit that's premised on an espionage agreement than just the fact that it tends to compromise secret information, it is true that applying the Totten rule of dismissal does provide a clear mechanism that protects confidential information. And I would analogize it to this Court's decision in Snepp where the Court adopted a constructive trust arrangement. The Court adopted that arrangement where -- where an employee who violated a -- a prepublication review agreement had to turn over all the proceeds to the Government. And -- and the Court adopted that remedy in favor of a damages remedy, and the Court did so to send a clear signal to the employees that there is no incentive whatsoever to violate the terms of these agreements. In the same way, having a clear rule of dismissal sends a clear message to espionage agents that there's no point in even bothering to file the suit in the first place. It will simply be dismissed.

03-1395 +++$+++ 3398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I just wanted to ask one. I don't remember whether the briefs discuss it or not, but is there a statute that prohibits the disclosure of secret agents like this and does that -- if so, does that have any relevance to this case?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, there is such a statute. There's a statutory provision that gives the authority. It had been with the -- with the Director of Central Intelligence. The recent Intelligence Reform Act has transferred it to the Director of National Intelligence. But it gives a requirement that the -- that -- that the director protect sources and methods. I think that that -- that statutory provision is consistent with the general notion behind the Totten doctrine, but I don't think it's --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And does the statute impose a penalty on anyone for revealing the name of a secret agent?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think it -- it certainly doesn't impose any kind of monetary penalty. There are, under certain circumstances, criminal penalties for the disclosure of classified information, but I think that the --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But is the identity of an agent a -- a type of classified information protected by the statute?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it is. It's protected both by the sources and method provision, and I think revelation of a source could implicate the -- the criminal prohibitions in the statute as well. And I think that this statute -- I think you can see the extent to which this -- this case implicates the core of the secrets that the agency has. This Court in the Sims case described the sources and methods protected by the statute as the heart of the intelligence community.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Clement --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And this case involves both.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the -- the argument made by the other side, which seems to me has some plausibility to it, is that Totten was decided in an age when courts were not as flexible as they are today. We -- we have procedures for matters being kept confidential by courts. We -- we allow hearings that are closed in matters that never would have been done before. And since, the argument goes, the -- the only purpose of Totten was to preserve the secrets, why can't we preserve the secrets that way? If and when it turns out that the prosecution of this -- of this suit would require a secret to be disclosed, we will terminate it or -- but -- but up until then, why -- why decide in advance? Why not take a -- take a run at it and see?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, there's a couple of points to be made about that. One, as this Court recognized in Reynolds -- in the Reynolds state secrets context itself, even the provisions of going forward, no matter what innovations have been made, the -- the provisions of going forward and handling classified information necessarily involve risks that the information will be disclosed. In the first place, both Totten and the state secrets privilege itself are premised on the notion that the information, if it is in fact privileged, is withheld from the case. It's an absolute privilege. So the idea is not that you have some sort of limited disclosure to the court personnel and to the ultimate fact-finder in the case and that's somehow all consistent with the state secrets privilege. To the contrary. Once a determination is made that a matter is state secrets, there's no further disclosure of the information. You -- the whole premise of state secrets is not that you try to prevent ultimate disclosure to the general public. It's that once something is privileged, you -- you treat the matter as privileged and you take it out of the case.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you're not making that statement with respect to anything that's classified. There was something in your brief, reply brief, at 18 and 19 in which you -- you cite Reynolds and you say the proper response to classified information in civil litigation is to disregard the classified information, not to order partial disclosure to court personnel. Are -- are you saying then in all of civil litigation if information is classified, then it's just out of the case?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I think there can be certain arrangements in certain civil litigation where the Government can agree with a party to proceed -- as part of their overall agreement, to proceed on the basis of classified information, but that would involve a very different way of -- of proceeding than the normal default rules. And I think absent some kind of agreement for the Government to proceed in that way, the default rule in civil litigation has always been that the privilege is just that. It's -- the matter is -- the matter is privileged and it's taken out of the case.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. But you lose. I mean, if -- if that matter is necessary for your case, don't -- don't you lose?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely not, Justice Scalia, not in civil litigation. And that's why the state secrets privilege is, I mean, quite a remarkable doctrine in the civil side of the case.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're talking about civil only.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Only civil.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm thinking of gray mail. Certainly in the criminal -- criminal area, that isn't the case.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly right, Justice Scalia.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You either cough it up or you lose.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, and a different bargain has been reached in the criminal context, and in that context to ameliorate the consequence of the sometimes difficult choice of revealing classified information or proceeding, the Congress has come through with the Classified Information Procedures Act. That only applies in the criminal side, though.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I just want to ask one question. Don't they have a claim interpreted favorably to them that this has nothing to do with a contract, totally nothing? Okay? But there happen to be some rules over there in the CIA in their books somewhere, which we've never read, and they say when we use a foreign person as a spy, we'll pay him some money or we give him something. We have some procedures. Now, we don't have to do that as a matter of contract. We don't have to do it at all, but we do it. And so there's a claim here that we want to see that they're following their own rules. They say Totten doesn't apply to that because Totten is about contracts. Our claim isn't about contracts.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer, I have two responses to that. The first is I think the -- that the Totten doctrine extends more broadly than just the narrow confines of the contract.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it doesn't extend to torts, does it?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would -- I mean, I would need a specific hypothetical. I can't imagine a tort that by its nature --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, you go --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- depends on the relationship.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You go ahead. You go ahead.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I can't imagine a tort that depends on its very nature on the relationship. But we're talking about regulations that, as I understand the other side's allegations, are regulations for handling secret contracts. So unless one can allege that they were a party to a secret contract or at least a secret relationship, there's no point in that individual even being in a position -- they wouldn't even have standing to challenge the regulation.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so you're saying if in fact, when you look at those allegations, they're about regulations for handling secret contracts, it's about a contract, but if there were to be an allegation that it has nothing to do with the contract at all, it's just a way we handle retired foreign spies, Smiley for example, or someone like that. It has nothing to do with it, you see. Then could they -- what would be the rules then?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I still think the answer would be that there would be no relief under that circumstance because their -- their -- still their claim to having any entitlement under those rules at all would -- I mean, you know, total strangers don't have rights under those regulations. Alleged spies would have rights under those regulations, and the very idea of walking into court and asserting your rights as an alleged spy is inconsistent with the entire relationship and the contract that gave rise to it. I would also point you to the Weinberger decision, Weinberger against Catholic Action, because there this Court applied Totten to not force the Navy to produce an environmental impact statement even though there were regulations on the book -- and the concurring Justices focused on those regulations -- where the Department of Defense said we do produce an environmental impact statement even if it's classified. So I think on the authority of Weinberger as well, the very fact that there are internal regulations on a subject, the entire subject matter of which is secret, doesn't give rise to judicially enforceable rights. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the time for rebuttal.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Burman.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3430 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: First, with respect to the question about the due process rights below, I would note that the Government does not challenge, and specifically said so in footnote 2 of the petition for cert and footnote 1 in their brief on the merits, whether there is a due process claim here. I would encourage you -- and I will come back to the due process question if you're interested. I'd encourage you to look at the respondents' appendix, pages 72 to 74, where the CIA employee described the fact that there are, in fact, regulations that are not limited to enforcing a secret contract. That is not our claim.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But they are regulations that the -- that depend upon the existence of a spy-principal relationship --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Actually we don't believe that's correct, Your Honor. We believe that --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, are you claiming that your -- your people are -- were not spies?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We allege that they were coerced into that relationship, but we do --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, however got there --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- they -- they -- your claim is that they're spies and that, therefore, whatever your procedural claims may be, whatever your substantive due process rights may be, as I understand it, depends upon the assumption of a spy-principal relationship.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do not agree with that, Your Honor.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We believe that PL-110 allowed the admission of people essential to the United States without any comment on whether they had formerly been spies and that these regulations do not require us to prove as an essential element even to the CIA, much less to the district court --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that they were spies for the CIA.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- you don't have to prove that they were spies, but you have to prove that -- that they had a contractual relationship with the United States. And the only contractual relationship you're asserting is the relationship of a spy.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We disagree with that, Your Honor.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do not believe -- and in fact, the Ninth Circuit went out of its way to make very clear to the district court that if we try to plead around and base a claim on a contract, the district court should dismiss that.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, wait. What -- what is the basis on which you assert these regulations are applicable to you --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to your client?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- we say that the -- we believe we can show, once we are allowed to proceed -- and it's premature at this time to decide whether we'll be successful in this or not. We believe we can show that the CIA has internal regulations that say as to PL-110 resettlees, we will provide continued financial and security support in these circumstances, a need-based standard.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and the agency comes in and says, prove that you're a PL-110 resettlee.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The agency --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and what is your response to that?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The agency has never --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your response is I was resettled because I was a spy.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. We don't have to say that. We can say we were resettled under PL-110, which they have to inform at the time the INS Commissioner that they were bringing in people as PL-110 resettlees. They're not required to tell the INS Commissioner that they were spies, just that they're essential.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What if -- what if the Government takes a slightly different tack and -- and you bring your essentially PL-110 neutral claim, and the Government says, the only relationship upon which this claim can be based by these particular Does is a spy relationship? We claim privilege, and on the basis of that privilege, we -- we claim dismissal. What is your response to that?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that were an essential element of our claim, which we believe it is not --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they're not saying it's an essential element in the sense that only a spy can make a 110 claim. They're saying that the only basis upon which you can make a 110 claim is the spy relationship. You have no other. How do you respond to that?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Hence the reason we brought the case as Does. A procedure that was not known for that purpose at the time of Totten, that their own information officer and their brief and their position in Webster admits preserves the identity, preserves the secret. They acknowledge --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, look, you're talking about procedural means. I want to know what your immediate response to their claim of privilege is. Are you going to say we weren't spies?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The advantage of the Reynolds procedure is if they had made the claim of privilege, we would know what they were claiming was privileged.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They are making the claim of privilege on the ground that the only basis for your 110 claim is or can be, on facts known to them, that your clients were spies. Do you respond by saying, yes, we were spies, or do you respond by saying, we weren't spies?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We respond by saying we have an entitlement to a fair process within the agency, a confidential process --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let's assume that you have a really obnoxious court -- (Laughter.)
03-1395 +++$+++ 3466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that wants a substantive response, do you respond by saying they're right, we're spies, or they're wrong, we weren't spies?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If their position is that they can't confirm or deny to the district court whether we were spies --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They are claiming a privilege on the grounds that the only basis for your claim can possibly be the spy relationship based on facts known to them. In order to defeat that privilege, you've got at least to start by saying, no, we weren't spies and we don't claim to be. Are you going to say that or aren't you?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We are not going to say we were not spies. We are going to --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then I don't know why you're not out of court on Totten.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because we are not claiming the benefit of a bargain to be a spy. We are not seeking compensation --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is a PL --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You are -- you are --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is a PL-110 settlee?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ A PL-110 resettlee allowed the CIA and the FBI to bring in up to 100 people per year that were deemed essential to the U.S. They could have been simply very important scientists who wished to defect.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. So you would say this --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They could have been any --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are -- are you claiming that your answer to Justice Souter's question is we will assume for purposes of this case -- we're not admitting whether it's true or not, but we're going to assume we're not spies --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We believe --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- because we win even if we're not spies because we are essential persons?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If we had made the Totten mistake of suing in our own name, we would be out of court, but we have sued as Does and we have said we are satisfied with the CIA concluding internally whether we are entitled to PL-110 status.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right, but my guess is -- well, he's pushed you and it sounds like it to me -- that the only basis on which you could say you were an essential person is that you're a spy.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We don't --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He's -- he's not a scientist. He's not a --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Since they have not contested our PL-110 status until a somewhat desperate comment in the reply brief, we have never had to face this question because there has been no question that we are PL-110 resettlees, and that as long as we do not disclose our identity, which we've been careful not to do, unlike Totten, there is no state secret that is -- is at risk.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if the question comes up, you're going to have to disclose the identity. I mean, if -- if it is controverted whether indeed you're -- you're a spy or not, then what do you do? Do you say, well, we'll -- we'll do it in camera? That's right? I mean, you -- you think that -- that a United States district court has all of these security facilities available as Langley? I mean --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- trust me, it doesn't.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do not believe that we have to have -- that we have to disclose anything to the district court to have standing as Does to seek a fair procedure within the CIA. At the time of Totten, the idea of having a Doe being able to sue was not recognized for a plaintiff who wanted to protect his identity. We have that now as of the last --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we have to change Totten? Because, look, what I'm now thinking is, A, if you're suing on a contract, you win because you're a spy, if you win. If you're suing on promissory estoppel, you win because you're a spy, if you win. If you're suing on PL-110, you win because you're a spy, and if you're suing on due process, you win because you're a spy. So no matter what, you can't win unless you're a spy. Now, they -- they have Totten, and it -- it -- that sounds to me as if you're there. And do we have to overturn Totten for you to win?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I do not believe so, but you should not expand Totten in the dramatic way the Government asks. And it does not counsel for you to expand Totten when they cannot define a clear line as to where this jurisdictional, which they use in the brief but abandon here -- they cannot explain to you why in Webster -- they argued on pages 37 to 40 of their brief for exactly the same interpretation of Totten that they are arguing now. They specifically said that it should not be up to the courts to look behind the scene of the privilege in Reynolds, and yet the Court rejected that position. In Hamdi, they said there cannot be a secret proceeding with due process and the courts cannot review whether we've made that available, and the Court rejected that. Things have changed since the time of Totten. That does not require overruling Totten, but it certainly does not counsel expanding Totten in the dramatic way that the executive asserts, a way that basically says to the Court you have absolutely no role in determining whether our assertion that the state secret is an essential element here is in fact the case and whether it truly is a state secret. We -- if there's anything we ought to be able to decide it's what our case is about. We may have loosely used bargain in the complaint, but the district court and the Ninth Circuit have now made it very clear that we cannot have a contract claim, we cannot have a due process, whether substantive or procedural, based upon a contract, we cannot have a promissory estoppel claim. The Ninth Circuit has decided all of that against us. What we still have, though, is a claim to a fair, internal agency procedure.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Attached to what? I mean, you can -- a fair procedure leading nowhere is not a claim. You have a right to a fair procedure because it's attached to some substantive right.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's what we haven't yet had the opportunity to prove as to what it is in these regulations. But if you would look at -- again, at the respondents' appendix 72 to 74, the agency's witness that they voluntarily made available, did not make any assertion of privilege, did not make any assertion that this was confidential asked, are there agency regulations that you know of that relate to the resettlement of these PL-110 people who are resettlees from foreign countries? Yes. Are there regulations that deal with the determination of the level and extent of benefits to be given resettlees? Yes. And are there agency regulations that deal with grievances by resettlees? Yes. We think no minimal due process allows them to tell us the wrong standard and not to give us notice and an opportunity to be heard in a confidential proceeding --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You still have --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- what's your best case for that? What's your best case for that proposition?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, certainly Matthews v. Eldridge.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because it sounds to me like due process in -- in the air.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We don't believe it is, Your Honor. We -- we don't know for sure until we are entitled to litigate the regulation.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. We know enough at the summary judgment stage for us to -- to decide whether the case can go forward or the dismissal stage.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there has been no summary judgment --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Or dismissal stage.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ At -- at the dismissal stage, our pleadings have to be accepted as true, and we believe that the pleadings sufficiently assert that there are regulations there that create a -- a property interest and that --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3504 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That create a property right?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3505 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the property right is the contract with the United States. I mean, you can't get away from the contract by calling it a property right.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do not believe there is a contract and we do not believe we have to rely on it. We were -- the Does were coerced into what they did. They do not seek compensation.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is your strongest case? I don't think Matthews addresses it. What is your strongest case for the notion that you have a property interest even though you don't have a contract?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Probably Perry v. Sindermann in the sense that there was clear that the contract was over but the Court indicated that --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that was the firing of a school teacher. There was --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3511 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was a nonrenewal.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- there was -- there was an interest in having your job, contract property, and interest in getting back salary, contract property. Not this case.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- what the Court actually, I believe, focused on there and in Goldberg v. Kelly was the question of whether there were regulations --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Goldberg v. Kelly, welfare benefits, money.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We believe this is in a sense the equivalent of a welfare benefit.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Perry v. Sindermann. Is that -- that's the nontenured teacher?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There's no property right there, I don't think. I've always taught that as a ground that it wasn't compared to Roth where there was. All right. So -- so -- but there was a First Amendment interest of some kind.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I believe the Court indicated that it would be possible if there were practices and policies that had been established that set substantive standards for continuing that there would be a property right in a fair procedure for determining that internally at the school.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're probably right if they have -- I see what you're saying.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We also believe there is a liberty interest. These people came to the U.S. in danger. The mere fact of labeling them essential to the United States and bringing them in in the PL-110 status, taking away their identity, giving them a false identity, false references, changing their occupations, all of those things we believe -- we have an argument -- created a liberty interest in continuation of the protection. It's the special relationship, the Dushane-type argument that the -- that the Ninth Circuit relied on. But I would hasten to add it is premature to determine whether we win on the merits, and the Government is absolutely wrong in their brief in suggesting that unless we can prove at this point that we can win on the merits, that we don't have standing. We have standing to make a claim for fair procedures. Those procedures may include confirming internally to the CIA our identity and they may include confirming whether we satisfy whatever the need-based standard is that the CIA has identified. We have made every possible effort to comply with the covenant that Totten imposed in a contract, a contract that we don't believe we have. We sued as Does. We have sought preapproval of every single filing. We had -- counsel that learned any confidential information were precleared by the agency. That is not what happened in Totten. Those are procedures, as Justice Scalia has suggested, that did not -- were not recognized at the time of Totten just like the due process claim was not recognized at the time of Totten. And it is a claim that can be done internally to the CIA.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You think that Totten would be decided differently today because of the -- our due process jurisprudence?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We believe that Totten didn't know to make a claim other than contract.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- that's not my question.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, we do.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose Mr. Totten is here today.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if there were regulations in the Totten situation that created some sort of meaningful standard that would be applied by an internal procedure, which the record shows here the CIA has an internal procedure, not just regulations setting out the standard, but a review process. We simply want to have a fair, internal procedure. This case really is not about the protection of state secrets, but the limits of the executive authority to unilaterally assert without any review by the court --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How would the court -- a court go about monitoring this fair procedure --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We -- we don't believe the court would have a role in monitoring the fair procedure. It would simply determine whether the procedure that the CIA has described in the court record already satisfied minimum standards of -- of due process. If the court found that it did not --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And then you -- you said that -- suppose you knew what it was on paper and then you wanted to complain to a court, that's not what they gave us. They said that in their regulations, but they gave us something much less.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's possible that the CIA would assert that there is some reason that it gave less than its regulations that would be a state secret. It's hard for us to imagine what that would be, but in fact that is open on remand for the -- for the CIA to argue that.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do these regulations just set forth a procedure or do they set forth some substantive entitlement?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They seem to do both. They -- we haven't, of course, seen them in full yet, but they set forth a procedure and then they also say that there is some sort of need, age, indigency, and health-based standard for continuing the support. And if you'll notice --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then it will be worse for them. I mean, they say, look, frankly we'd rather reveal the names of one or two spies than we would like to reveal our procedures for dealing with the spies we bring into the United States. It will take someone who reads those about 15 minutes with a computer to locate 400 resettled spies. That will be a terrible disaster.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that was an external process, but we agree it should be internal to the CIA, that the process for applying that standard must remain internal to the CIA. The Does share the interest in protecting their identity and the identities of others like them. We -- we believe that the Government --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's your answer? What is your response?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That there's no external -- there -- there will be no public knowledge of that information, that they can explain their -- they can apply their process internally, apply the need-based process internally, and that will not be litigated in the courts if they assert executive -- or state secret privilege as to that, and we assume that they would at that point. But we -- we agree --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the court would say you don't have a cause of action unless it knows what -- what these regulations say. Surely the regulations have to be disclosed to the court at least.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We -- we believe that's the case and they have not yet said that it would hinder the state secrets at all to disclose them, and they have disclosed quite a bit and said that the remainder they are holding back only a need-to-know basis. They have not asserted any state secret privilege with the remaining regulations. And we know, in fact, from the letter that is in the record from -- between the CIA and the Justice Department in which the -- there was basically an understanding that there would be regulations like this in order to make sure that these PL-110 resettlees did not effectively become wards otherwise on -- on the Government and that the CIA would continue some responsibility for them. The -- we are not aware of any case in which this Court has suggested that there is an obligation of the district court to look behind the use of Doe and determine in a public manner the identity of the person. That -- the Government seems to assume that they have some entitlement to have a self-inflicted harm that they would demand that the identity of the Does be disclosed publicly and that they're entitled to do that. We do not believe that that's a required part of the use of Does. And in any event, we think it is somewhat similar to the criminal context where, if the Government is going to insist on moving forward in some way that is an affirmative defense like that, they may well have a responsibility for not being able to defend their position if they, at the same time, say that the state secret privilege applies. But at this point, anyway, that has not been presented to the district court. We -- we find it strange that the Government so quickly now says, unlike what it argued in Webster, that there is this type of contract which is not subject to the jurisdictional bar, and that is a contract with their own employees when they tell us that those same employees are going to know a much broader swath, as Mr. Clement said, of secrets. If their rationale made sense as something that was so compelling that the Court should create a jurisdictional bar for what the courts would otherwise have the capacity and the competence to do, you would think it would apply in that situation as well. But the fact is they lost Webster, and so they have to try to say that there is something still very broad about Totten but explain away Webster, and they simply cannot convincingly do that. Webster was the same argument by them. Reynolds was the same argument by them, and they lost.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May -- may I ask you what is probably a stupid question? Why isn't the contract barred by the statute of frauds?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we haven't thought about that because we haven't proceeded on -- on the contract. There may well -- we -- it probably is.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And there -- we -- we -- but we do not proceed on the contract. The Does, in fact, do not underestimate the risks of disclosure of their identities and of their relationship with the CIA. Perhaps they put too much into the complaint describing at some length what they did, but the reason for that, I suggest, is understandable. It was subject to preapproval by the agency. Why not put the equities in there even though they're not essential elements of your claim and see if the agency approves them? The agency approved them. We should not be thrown out of court because we put into the complaint allegations which the agency admits using the Doe, do not threaten any secrets, and which are not part of the essential elements of our claim.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are all of these what you call 110 resettlees -- are they all CIA resettlees?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does not appear that they are.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Some of them State Department and --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ At -- at least -- my understanding is at least the FBI and perhaps the Commissioner of INS at the time for -- perhaps at the request of other agencies. It appears that all three agencies had the ability to create this exception to the normal immigration procedure. If the Does can show on remand that the CIA's regulations are as they allege and that PL-110 status generally, which is what the CIA witness McNair basically said, that many PL-110 resettlees are in continued danger because of the nature of which we brought them in, regardless of what they did before we decided to bring them in, or if they can show that in their particular situation there is a -- a special relationship of danger created, we believe we would have a substantive due process argument and a procedural due process argument. That is not today's question. The Government has agreed that for purposes of today's question, it should be assumed that we can make out a due process claim. That claim is --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not quite sure where the Government has said that. You talk about footnote 2. All it said was that they're not appealing the point that you have to go to the Court of Claims.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And also in footnote 1 in the -- in their brief on the merits to this Court. I think it's on page 7. My reading of that is that they are not challenging the due process analysis, and it would be premature to challenge the due process analysis at this time, which is what the Court said in Webster. We believe that our due process argument is stronger than the due process argument that was made in Webster, but the Court in any event said that's not what is -- what is before us at this time. And -- and we believe that that's the same situation now.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you agree --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm just wondering what --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Excuse me. Do you agree your due process argument does depend on having either a property interest or a liberty interest?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm just wondering what's, you know, some foreign -- I don't know who -- who the Does spied on, but let's assume -- you say they're in danger. Somebody may be interested in -- in the subject. What kind of security provisions do you have in your law office that would -- that would make them immune from the kind of intrusion that foreign espionage services --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In -- in general, we have not been allowed to take information outside of the agency. Even when we're in the clear --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not talking about the agency. Just about the name of your clients. I think it's -- there are countries interested in -- in, you know, who was spying on them.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That was their decision to trust us with that, and ironically under the Government's theory of this case, the Does --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but it may lead -- it may lead to other agents and -- and one of the problems about allowing suits like this is that this information about who the agents are will be brought to a lawyer, kept in his law office, and much more readily accessible to -- to foreign powers than -- than it would be at Langley.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And under the agency's theory of this case, there is nothing that stops the Does from making their identities public because there is no enforceable contract that the agency can enforce. The agency wants to keep Snepp. It wants to live with Webster, and the only thing it has left is to somehow carve out a rule that applies to these people who have done everything they possibly could, including not telling me who they are. Our files within our office do not identify them in writing, is my understanding, by name. I certainly am not aware of who they are. I know what's alleged in the complaint and nothing more than that. But certainly the risk of gray mail, the risk of the Does -- people in the Does' position disclosing something is totally irrelevant to the question of whether Totten creates some sort of bar that applies not just to a contract claim but to a claim where there is no contract, where it is not alleged that it is based upon a contract, and where the parties have done everything possible -- the Does, the plaintiffs, have done everything possible to honor the confidences that the Government wants to keep. Thank you, Your Honors.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Burman. Mr. Clement, you have about 4 and a half minutes if you need them.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3562 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, just a few points. And may it please the Court, just a few points in rebuttal. First of all, as I think Justice Kennedy's question indicated, there was no waiver of any due process argument. If you look at those footnotes, the only thing that's waived is the Tucker Act concern that we talked about earlier. Second of all, I think in thinking about this PL-110 claim, it's important to acknowledge, as I think Justice Scalia was suggesting, that it is the PL-110 claim to the CIA. And as I understand their argument, it depends on their being a significant difference between coming into court and saying I'm an unacknowledged spy and I'd like to sue the CIA and coming into court and saying I am an unacknowledged PL-110 resettlee with a claim against the CIA, please hear my claim. I would say there's no material difference in terms of all of the policies that undergird the Totten doctrine between those two. And I would note that even the Ninth Circuit recognized at 35a and 37a of the petition appendix that the respondents would have to establish a relationship with the agency. The final two points I would make is, first of all, they would like to make some benefit of the fact that they are suing as Does as opposed to the Totten case. I would make two points about that. First of all, presumably the reason that William Lloyd could use his name in the Totten case is because it was a suit by his estate and he was deceased, so he didn't have a concern about retaliation. (Laughter.)
03-1395 +++$+++ 3563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would also say that the difference between suing under Doe and suing under your name just makes clear that both sides to this litigation start with the premise that the fundamental fact of this litigation turns on a secret. They don't want their name revealed any more than we want the name revealed, and that just underscores how this is all about a secret, just as in Totten. The last point I would make is they asked you to take their pleadings as a given at this stage in the litigation, and I would ask you to look at those pleadings. The complaint is replete with references to the espionage relationship, and the complaint itself cites Totten or the Totten doctrine no less than seven times. I would suggest that if this claim is not Totten-barred, then no claim is. With that, I'd ask the court below be reversed.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. The case is submitted.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3568 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument in the case of Rousey against Jacoway. Ms. Karlan.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3570 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Yesterday in Koons Buick against Nigh, this Court emphasized once again that statutory interpretation is a holistic process based on common sense, that the reading of the statute should look at all the words to avoid a passing strange or an anomalous result when the text does not dictate it and the statutory history suggests otherwise.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That was a case I dissented in, wasn't it?

03-1407 +++$+++ 3575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I was a little bit surprised at your opening because it seems to me you have a strong textual argument you're now defending.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We do. A holistic reading of the text shows that section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What does a holistic reading mean? Can you stay within the --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- text and still be holistic?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not going to look outside the text at all. A holistic reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, which is on -- in the petitioners' brief at pages 1 through 2 --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What does the word holistic mean? (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it means read all the words in the sense that makes the most sense to you rather than plucking words at random or rather than looking at a word artificially. For example, when you look at a phrase like on account of in the Bankruptcy Code, as the Court did in North LaSalle, account means a lot of different things, but there it clearly meant because of, as it does in this statute.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So the antonym would be parsimonious or something like that?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it'd be partial, but I'm not sure.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, let -- let me ask --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- ask you this. The -- the statute does say that the right to receive a payment is on account of age, and that seems to me to be an argument somewhat in respondent's favor because the -- the payment has to be triggered by the age, if you read it that way, and it seems to me that's a fair way to read it.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, and I think payments are triggered by age because section 522(d)(10)(e) is a statute eminently about the protection in bankruptcy of retirement payments. For individuals --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the problem for the court below was that the person covered can ask for it in a lump sum and pay a penalty.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, and that's not --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and that isn't then on the basis of age. Am I right? Is that -- that was the problem the court had below.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, that's the problem the court had below. I think it's an illusory problem for the following reason. It's clear that the right to receive full enjoyment of payments under an IRA does not attach until one of the triggering events occurs. The trigger events are age 59 and a half, disability, illness, or for the estate, death. And that's the right that we're talking about here, and that's why --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, when you say full enjoyment, you -- you think when -- when I'm taxed on something, I -- I don't have full enjoyment of it? The only thing triggered by age, as far as I can tell -- the only thing triggered by age -- is your obtaining of a tax benefit. That's all. Once you reach a certain age, you can withdraw it without -- without paying the 10 percent tax.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, but the 10 percent tax here is designed and does, in fact, operate as a deterrent and a penalty.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'm sure it does, but -- but it's -- it's hard to accept the notion that simply because after a certain age I get a tax benefit, I'm receiving the money on account of my age. That doesn't make any sense to me.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, the way that I would view that is prior to age 59 and a half, you pay a penalty. And Congress put that penalty in there because the holistic sense, the full reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) is it is designed to protect retirement savings, replacement income of the elderly, the disabled, or ill people, once they get to the point where those triggering events, which are in 522(d)(10)(e), occur. Those are the same triggering events --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Ms. Karlan, the -- as long as this money was in the plan, it was shielded from bankruptcy, and there are -- there was not unlimited access even with the penalty when it was in the plan. One thing that I don't know and may be of some significance, did the Rouseys have a chance, even though they lost their employment, to keep their money in the plan where it would be shielded from bankruptcy or did they have to roll it over?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Northrop Grumman's policy is to require individuals who leave the company's employment to roll their pension plans into an IRA. The Rouseys tried to get work in Arkansas when they moved there. Had they gotten a job there that they were able to keep, which they were unable to do because of their health, they could have rolled that money back into an undeniably, completely exemptible.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Another employer's plan.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But they could not have kept it in this employer's plan?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. This employer did not permit individuals to keep the money in the plan. They were told they had to remove the money when they lost their jobs.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That was a term of the plan that it -- you can remain in it only so long as you're employed?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Apparently so.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are there any other plans that are -- are entities clearly covered by the statute in which the only effect of age is to enable you to avoid a tax?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Well, then --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me give you a couple --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- then you might persuade me.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me give you a couple of examples --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3611 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3612 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that I think will be quite familiar. A 401(k) plan allows you to get access to money before you turn 59 and a half on account of hardship, and you pay a 10 percent tax penalty if you do so. The Federal Government's thrift savings plan for Federal employees allows you to take a loan out of the plan and to pay the interest back into your own account before you turn 59 and a half, thereby essentially giving you free use of the money. If you don't pay the loan back, it's then treated as a -- as a distribution, and you pay the 10 percent tax penalty on it. So that if you read this statute to -- not to include IRA's, to deny exemption to IRA's, you read this statute to deny exemption to virtually all of the modern forms of defined contribution pension plans or savings plans.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3613 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. That was what I was going -- aren't most of the pension profit-sharing, stock bonus plans, and annuities similar to the IRA's in terms of allowing withdrawal on the payment of a penalty?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3614 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3615 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought they were all in the same boat. So what the effect of this rule is -- of the Ninth Circuit is that they would all fail to qualify --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, that's correct. You would render section 522(d)(10)(e) essentially a nullity.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, it's the Eighth Circuit. Excuse me.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3618 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. I -- I can see why you might have thought it was the Ninth Circuit. (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3619 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it might be wrong anyway. (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3620 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3621 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What is the percentage amount of the payments that are taken out of all IRA plans before people are 59 and a half?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3622 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in the Cilek case from the Seventh Circuit, which is cited in our brief, the court there cited statistics that suggested it was between 1.2 and 1.7 percent of funds in IRA's were removed early under the penalty process.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3623 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the -- the payment here -- it says -- the statute uses the word payment. So suppose you simply have an IRA plan but you don't take money out of it. Then is it exempt from bankruptcy?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would be because it's the right to the future payments and not just the present payments, Justice Breyer.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so -- but I'm trying -- what I'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take -- just reading it in English, it sounds as if a person were to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and pay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would not be a -- a payment because of age, but one that he took out after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty would be.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Justice Breyer. But in order to protect the ability to take money out after someone turns 59, you have to protect the corpus of the IRA now because otherwise, when he turns 59 and a half, there won't be any money there for him to take out. And that's why the exemption extends not just to present payments, as the Third Circuit erroneously held, but also to the corpus when it is necessary for the support of the debtor. And I can't emphasize --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Ms. Karlan, let me ask something about that very point because the statute says that to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor it's allowable.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice O'Connor.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are you aware of cases where the bankruptcy court has said, well, you don't need all that money? That's a big plan. You don't need all that. We'll just let you deduct X amount.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. We cite a number of them in both the opening brief and in the yellow brief on pages 19 through -- to 20, I think is where we -- where we talk about --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can we take this concrete case? Hers was something over $12,000; his, something over $42,000.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What was the claim here as to -- was part or all of that -- it would be some $54,000.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The claim was all that all of that was necessary. If I could give an example that I think Justice O'Connor might find instructive here. When a debtor, for example, is 40 years old, they generally require turnover of the entire IRA because people have time to earn the money back again. When the debtor has other retirement savings, for example, in a case from Virginia called Abate, because the person also had a 401(k) plan, they were required to turn over the entire IRA. When a debtor is able to work, even if the debtor is in his or her 50's, courts will often require exclusion of at -- will also require turnover of at least part of the IRA. In this case --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what do the courts do if they say, well, my client might be ill or something like that? It seems to me --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if the client is ill now, they get to keep it --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. They -- they say my client is able-bodied now, but we -- we need something because -- I don't know -- there's a history of family illness or something.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There isn't a reported case that talks about the possibility of future illness as a reason of exempting the money.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's -- I'm trying to figure out how -- how -- what the theory is. Is -- you say I have a right to receive payments because of age. And you say, well, here I have a body of money and 99 percent comes out of it after you're 60. 1 percent comes out before. So it's very tempting to say that that corpus there, of course, is a body of money that you're going to have a right to receive because of age because the practical effect of the 10 percent is -- is -- stops the -- the younger person getting the money. So does the case then turn on that? I mean, suppose -- suppose it were a 3 percent penalty and 40 percent of the people took out the money before they were 60 or a 1 percent penalty and 80 percent did it. Then should I reach the other result? I'm just trying to think of how does this analysis work. What's the right analysis?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would say at the 1 percent and 80 percent of the people are taking the money out, it wouldn't operate really as a retirement plan anymore. But if I can give another statistic that might be helpful in thinking about this. 18 percent of the participants in large 401(k) plans who are under the age of 50 are taking loans out against those plans today.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What percent?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 18 percent in one of the surveys. And yet, those plans are undeniably, absolutely exempt under the bankruptcy --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they're taking out loans against it. They're -- they're not withdrawing the money.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but the loans because -- for example, in the Federal thrift savings plan, the interest is being paid back into your own account, it's essentially as close to taking out the money as you can get.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I still don't have your answer to the problem that bothered me at the first. How -- how do you reconcile your positions with on account of language? If the -- if your clients can take the money -- just take the money out of the IRA at any time, then why is it on account of age?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it's not the -- if you look at the statute -- and let me just work my way through it with you. It's the right to a payment under a stock bonus, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan on account of illness. And the question is what does on account of modify there. I think the most natural and sensible reading of the statute is a plan that is because of age, a plan that is because of disability, and the like.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you say that payment doesn't -- on account of doesn't modify payment.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't -- I don't think you need to read it that way, and I think the most sensible reading here, especially given that the statute --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I think the logical reading is that it -- it modifies payment.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I'm not sure that it does, but even if it did, Your Honor --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Holistic for me. What -- what does it -- what does it modify? I mean, if you had to diagram it, on account of goes to what noun?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, this is again -- I know you dissented yesterday, but this is a less than meticulously crafted statute.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I thought I was being holistic yesterday, to tell you the truth. (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. Okay.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- but what does on account of modify?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think what on account of modifies here is the kind of plan out of which the payment is coming.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where -- where is that noun?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There are a variety of plans, stock bonus, pension --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The right to receive a payment under a stock bonus, pension --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- profit sharing, annuity, or similar plan or -- or contract. It's a plan on account of illness, an annuity?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Plans --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why -- why isn't it a right on account of?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's the right on account of.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think you can read it either way and you'll get to exactly the same result. So let me read it the way that you've been reading it, which is if you want to protect the ability of people who have IRA's to withdraw money on account of age, you have to protect the IRA now or there will be no money in it for them to exercise their right to withdraw on account of age.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but -- but there still is a right to take payments at any time.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice -- Justice Kennedy, we don't believe --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so then you're -- you're --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that that's actually a right.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under that, you're giving the -- the language that follows it no meaning.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's what I'm doing here, and the reason I don't think that's what I'm doing is because this statute clearly refers to IRA's by name as one of the plans that's entitled to exemption.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But as purely English -- as purely English, I read it as saying it's a right. What is that right? The right is a right to receive a payment on account of age. That's the -- a plan. That's the right. Now, your argument, I take it, was -- is that yes, it's true you also have a right under certain conditions to take it without respect to age. So what we have here is a plan that gives you both kind of rights.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's a kind that gives you a right to take it with a penalty and a right to take it because of age without a penalty. And thus, the question is, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind of rights covered? And the language doesn't answer it. So --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But under Justice Breyer's hypothetical, that's just like a savings account.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, because the savings account doesn't have -- I mean, the savings account doesn't have the -- the penalty. Isn't your argument that you've got to read the right as meaning a right without penalty, because if you don't read it that way, then every one of these other retirement instruments is likewise going to fail? Isn't that your -- your strong point?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's your strong point.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. That's -- that's our strong point and we're sticking with it. (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. Right -- it's not a right if you have to pay a penalty for it.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. It's not a right, as we say in the reply brief, to park on the sidewalk because if you pay the parking ticket, you can park there.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I think no matter how --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's a good argument. I like that.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No matter how you read the statute, it's designed to cover IRA's, and any reading of the statute that ends up not covering IRA's will also not cover many of the other --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why didn't Congress just put in IRA's along with the other things?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They did, Justice Ginsburg. They did in the last line of the statute.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but that's sort of an oblique way to get it there. I mean, why didn't they put it together with the other string of plans?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, my best guess as to why they didn't do that is they started drafting the exemptions statute in 1973 and they enacted IRA's in 1974, so they stuck it in at the end of the list. That's my best guess.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What your -- what your opponents say is that the -- the thing at the end doesn't prove anything because they're willing to acknowledge that some IRA's can be so structured that you cannot withdraw until -- until you reach a certain age. And if they're structured that way, they would be covered. So you had to mention 408 in the -- in the exceptions. What's wrong with that argument?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what's wrong with that, Justice Scalia, is that all IRA's are designed and they're administered on forms that the Internal Revenue Service sets out and you buy the forms to allow for early withdrawal. So under their theory, there has -- there is not now and there has never been a single IRA anywhere in the United States --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that had that inability to take the money out subject to penalty prior to the age 59 and a half.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do -- do we know that? I mean, couldn't someone -- I -- I don't think this is a very plausible basis for construing the statute, but just as a technical matter, couldn't someone go to the bank or brokerage firm and say I want to set up an IRA, but I want the IRA to be, in -- in effect, like an irrevocable trust in which withdrawals can only be made on certain, specific conditions? And couldn't someone, using both the IRA mechanism and a State irrevocable trust document, create an IRA that would be as restricted as -- as the circuit suggested it might be?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't necessarily think so for the following reason. IRA's are off-the-rack products. They're a basic consumer product that 40 million people buy. People don't usually negotiate the terms. If you did negotiate the terms, though, here's the second problem. Anytime you deviate from the form that the Internal Revenue Service gives you, which also gives you these rights to withdraw early subject to penalty, you run the risk that your plan will then be held to be a nonqualifying plan under section 408 of the tax code. You then lose the ability to deduct the contributions going in. You then lose the ability to defer the payments on the income as it accrues in the account. Now, to answer the last part of your question, one of the things that has occurred over the last, say, 5 to 10 years is more and more States are passing laws that essentially protect IRA's in bankruptcy and out, as a matter of State law, from any attachment by creditors. Why do they do that? Because they recognize that IRA's are a fundamental piece of the retirement system today.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And some don't. And the -- and the State systems vary.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, but only four States offer no protection to IRA's from creditors as opposed to --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As opposed to how many who do?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 46 States offer some kind of protection. 23 States protect them without limit in bankruptcy and out. 6 of them protect them inside of bankruptcy using the State exemptions as long as the amount is reasonable and necessary for the debtor's support.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's what -- with the purpose that we're talking about now --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- if it's only 6 that, faced with a bankruptcy, would shelter the IRA.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. No. 23 of them would protect all IRA's. 6 would protect all IRA's if the money in them is necessary to the debtor's support, an additional 6. 6 more would protect all the money in an IRA as long as it was deposited 120 days or a year or 3 years before the debtor filed for bankruptcy. 3 of them will protect all IRA's up to a dollar amount. In Nevada, the dollar amount is $500,000. 8 States use, as their State exemption law, an IRA that -- a statute that has exactly the same language as the Federal statute. 6 of those State statutes have been interpreted by Federal courts to protect IRA's.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But here there was no choice of picking up on the State?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's a -- there's a weird anomaly in Arkansas, Your Honor, which is Arkansas law does, in fact, protect IRA's, but the Federal bankruptcy courts in Arkansas have interpreted that law only to protect the IRA up to $500 because of a provision in the Arkansas constitution, article 9, section 2, that means that you can only save up to $500. So any bankrupt person in Arkansas who wants to keep any money in his -- in his IRA has to elect the Federal exemptions rather than electing the State exemptions.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And one train that we didn't finish before. You were explaining that in this case the entire $55,000 -- that entire sum would be needed -- would be necessary for the support of the debtors.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. The bankruptcy court did not rule on our claim that it was all reasonably necessary because they decided first that IRA's didn't come within the meaning of section 522.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you -- that was your claim, and I --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How did you come to that conclusion, that the entire amount?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if you take, say, $55,000 and you ask what sort of annuity could you purchase when you hit age 59 and a half with that money, it will be an annuity that, I would guess -- you know, I -- I hate to do math in my head like this. I'd guess it would throw off a couple of hundred dollars a month in additional income. And so if you ask will the Rouseys need that money for their support, I think the answer is yes because their only other support --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well. Oh, yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- is Social Security and a $2,000 a month defined benefit plan that will never go up and against which their Social Security will be offset. So when they start becoming eligible, as Mr. Rousey is about to be, for Social Security, that defined benefit plan reduces their benefits. So if the Rouseys are to have an old age in which they can afford to live in any kind of reasonable circumstance at all, they need this money.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3719 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I go back and just nail down one lose end in -- in an answer that you -- you gave to my question, can you set up a kind of irrevocable? I assume clearly from what you say is that there is not only no statute, but no IRS reg or ruling to the effect that you can make your IRA terms more restrictive without jeopardizing your qualification.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3720 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I was unable to find one, Your Honor.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3721 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why didn't the Government come in here, just as a matter of curiosity? We don't have an amicus brief here from the Government, do we?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- no, we do not have one, and I don't --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Government has no position on the matter.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I don't think they've taken a position here. I will say that in Patterson against Shumate, they referred to IRA's in a footnote in their brief, I believe, as pension plans under section 408.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There -- they never go bankrupt, so the position they usually take is against any exemption from the -- (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- well, that's correct. The United States trustee may have wanted them to -- I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Ms. McKiever.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3731 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: Pursuant to section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor's right to receive a payment is not exempt unless two requirements are met. First, the right to receive the payment must be on account of illness, disability, death, age or length of service, and the right must come from a specified similar plan or contract. Because neither of those elements is satisfied in this case, the petitioners' IRA's are not exempt.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3732 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it -- is it the case that other plans that are clearly covered by the text of this statute also permit early withdrawal for certain reasons?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3733 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes and no, and let me explain that. Yes, they do permit withdrawals based upon certain factors. Those are enumerated based -- based upon each individual plan. However, they do not permit withdrawals for any reason at any time for any purpose.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not a single one of them.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not a single one of them. Now, of course, I've not read every plan ever created, but none of the plans that I have ever seen, as the specified plans, the pension plans, the profit-sharing plans, any of those, allow withdrawal for any reason at any time.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you'd say that if one of them did, it would also not be covered.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. It -- it is thought --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What -- what --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I take it -- in -- in answering Justice Scalia, I take it from what you didn't say that none of the -- we'll call them kind of the paradigm example plans are, however, as -- as restricted as the language in this -- this statute would suggest that it had to be if you read it in a -- in a very literal way.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There are --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, they're all a little bit sinful, at least, even if they're not as sinful as -- as you say the -- the 401 -- the -- the IRA is.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- that is correct. The -- there probably are plans out there -- once again, there are so many plans. And those are created by financial institutions, by employers, by different entities. So therefore there are thousands of variations of those.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, why? Okay. Once you're down that road, you have conceded, as you must, that a plan that says you get the money because of age but you also can get the money without respect to age in certain circumstances can be a plan covered by the act. Now, that's the kind of a plan that's right in front of you. So, therefore, literally it falls just as much within the language as the other that you want to say even though that is literally true, this plan is very different from the others in terms of the purposes of the act. That's what I would like to hear because to me, I'm not so moved by holistic as I am by purposes, which is part of holistic. So -- so the -- the point that I would like to know is why, since ordinary people think of IRA's as pensions -- I do. I think of it that way. I don't know much about it. It's designed to help in the future, help when you're old and sick. But there is this extra thing in it which you point to. So why, in terms of purposes is this different from the others?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is different because this is the only kind of plan where you can access the funds at any time for any purpose. It is also --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I know that, but -- but -- and you do it with a penalty. We agree about the facts.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3746 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3747 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I want to know why that difference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or less 2 percent of the people do access it before they're 60, 59 and a half.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3748 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because the right to -- to receive the payment, the right to access the money at any time exists no matter if it is exercised or not, and it does not meet the language of the statute. The statute very specifically --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3749 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. I -- you've missed my point and I'm sorry. I put you on the wrong track with my following up. I shouldn't have.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. Yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My question is we all agree that there can be plans where you can get the money not having to do with age, and they fall within the language of the act, and indeed, you say some are covered. But this one you say is worse than the others in terms of the purposes of the act, and that's what I want to hear why.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because there is no causal connection between any of the factors that are enumerated in the statute and the right to receive the money. And that is --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask this question? Supposing instead of a 10 percent penalty, there was an absolute prohibition, would you agree -- on getting the money before you're 59 and a half, would then that qualify?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3755 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely, yes, it would.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3756 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, what if there were a 50 percent penalty?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Clearly, there's a point at which it would qualify as a prohibition more than just --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what is it that makes it a prohibition? Is it -- is it because the purpose is to deter withdrawals, or it is that it becomes economically unacceptable? What -- what is the reason for drawing the line somewhere above 10 percent?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The reason for drawing the line is because at 10 percent, as the Eighth Circuit has stated in -- in the Huebner case, it -- it said that it's a minimal penalty. However, there is still the unfettered access that's available.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what is the purpose of imposing any penalty at all?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would assume as a disincentive to -- to withdraw, but it's clearly not a prohibition, such as the -- the parking --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But 50 percent would not be a prohibition and neither would 90 percent.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It would not be a prohibition, but it would operate more as a prohibition than 10 percent.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it's a matter of degree rather than a difference in kind.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Clearly that -- it's a very difficult line to draw. I -- I can't make that call at this moment, but --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me the easiest black letter rule is no tax or some tax. I mean, if it was totally free like an ordinary bank account, then you'd be dead right. But the fact that for a -- an important purpose there is a 10 percent penalty put in seems to me puts it into the category of things that are -- you're not supposed to have an absolute right to get.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the -- the hallmark difference here is that it -- it is the only type of account that you can access paying the penalty for any reason --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I assume --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- regardless of the specified reason.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that -- that your answer to Justice Breyer as to why that makes a difference with regard to the purpose of the statute is that the purpose of the statute is to make sure that people have money for their retirement, and that if you can withdraw it for any reason whatever, there is no security that that money will be there for their retirement; whereas if you limit the reasons to sickness and -- and a certain other number of emergency reasons, the chances the money will be there for the retirement are much higher.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that -- that's --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't that the answer?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if that's the answer, excellent. So now we have -- (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- let's say --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Scalia.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let's try -- let's try a million percent tax and nobody in history has ever withdrawn the money. Now, would -- that you would say would fall within this.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Fine, yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. Now, if that would fall within this, going back to Justice Stevens, because that operates as a bar to prevent the bad world that Justice Scalia mentioned, why doesn't a tax that operates as a bar that's good enough to stop 98.5 percent of the people from withdrawing their money and having nothing left for old age -- why isn't that just as good as the million percent tax in a world that is imperfect?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because clearly the -- the access of money and the ability to use it prior to retirement, just as -- as Justice Scalia just stated, that allows the -- the debtors to -- to access freely for any purpose, clearly not showing that -- that it would be for retirement purposes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But attachment of the --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3783 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right, but it's acquired. Say -- say retirement, not old age. I mean, you know, 60 -- it's not that bad -- (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3784 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ 93.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if that is going to be your criterion, the -- the total freedom for any purpose, then why, if we accept your argument, why -- why don't we face sort of a daunting run or the courts face sort of daunting future? Because the -- the question then is going to be, well, what purposes are sufficiently close to old age to -- to allow for a continued exemption and how free may the purposes be before a plan falls into the IRA category. You told us a few moments ago -- and I'm sure you -- you were right -- that the kind of the paradigm example plans vary enormously depending on the terms in which employers set them up. So if -- if we say that the -- the dividing line is going to be between plans under which withdrawal can be for any purpose versus plans in which withdrawal is going to be somehow limited, then we're going to have to litigate an awful lot of plans. Aren't we?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not necessarily. The -- the line that we're really looking to is that there has to be a direct causation factor between one of the five specified factors such as on -- on account of factors, age, disability, death, length of service, and the right to receive the payment.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but typically these plans like 401(k) plans permit hardship withdrawals, and other plans that are mentioned in the act allow withdrawals for medical reasons or to buy housing or something like that. I mean, you -- we would just have endless cases trying to figure out what qualifies and what doesn't. It seems like such a hard line for you to try to draw here.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And every plan that I know of allows withdrawal if you terminate employment.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's typically --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In fact, that's what happened to these people. So I just don't see how your argument is going to --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the -- the ability to access the funds, oftentimes with termination, has to do with the length of service, the years in service because they accumulate and oftentimes are not payable at the full percentage. They're not fully vested until that time. Also, with the -- when there are multiple factors existing in the right to receive the payments, each multiple factor can be a cause of the -- of the ability to reach the money. When there are no meaningful factors imposed, though --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't it simpler to just recognize that these plans are covered despite the right to withdraw and then rely on the provision in the statute that only permits the deduction to the extent reasonably necessary for the support? I mean, that -- that seems to me a fall-back position that's provided for in the statute.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understand that -- that may appear to be correct, but the problem with that is that as -- taxpayer status is not the hallmark in this case of if it is or is not exempt. Therefore, all types of accounts, whether they are truly retirement accounts or -- or if they're just savings accounts, could potentially qualify under this statute. If -- if you want to open it up and -- and allow all kinds of accounts to be exemptible under 522(d)(10)(e), the problem is that there is no limit on what can be potentially exempt under that statute.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. Well, obviously, it's -- it's governed by the statutory provision that it has to be a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of, and so on.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3797 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it includes IRA's apparently because of the last provision in the statute referring back to individual retirement acts under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3798 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The section 408 reference is -- does not in any way expand the exemption. In fact, it is a further condition to place on the -- the exemption. First of all, section 408 sets out only the minimum requirements for an IRA to qualify as a -- as a tax-favored plan. That --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3799 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ms. -- Ms. Karlan says she doesn't know of any -- of any IRA that did place a -- a restriction which would bring it within that exemption even though the ordinary IRA wouldn't be within the exemption. Do you know of any IRA, a single IRA that -- that has a provision in it restricting withdrawal?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3800 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely. Those are customizable plans. Any person can go into --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3801 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They can, but do -- do you know that there's -- there's one out there? I don't know --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3802 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I do know of several out there.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3803 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You didn't just draw one up for this case, did you? (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3804 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I did not create one for this case. No, I did not. But they -- they definitely exist. In fact, in the Andersen case out of the Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, the debtor had an annuity and prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition, she elected that she would only receive periodic payments based upon her age, and that was found to be exempt by the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel because that qualified. The payments were based upon her age, and it was then a similar plan because she could not access the funds at any time but only for the specified reason such as age.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3805 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was that -- was that an IRA that she had? It was an IRA?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3806 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My understanding is, yes, it was under section 408(b) was -- that's my understanding based upon that case.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3807 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me -- let me ask you. Maybe this is irrelevant, but were -- were these restrictive IRA's that you're aware of set up under those terms in contemplation of bankruptcy? If the answer is no, why would anyone so restrict his -- his IRA?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I do not know if that one specifically was, but no. These have not been set up through --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3809 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But why -- why would anyone do that? They're -- they're qualified without these restrictions. Why would anyone want to cut off his -- his rights to -- to withdraw?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3810 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Clearly to protect the money potentially for retirement and -- and just as --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3811 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, like setting up a personal spendthrift trust?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3812 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3813 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I want to make it tough so that I -- I will not be tempted to withdraw. Is that the motivation?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3814 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that would potentially be a motivation because clearly the money is there readily accessible at any time to -- to buy anything that the debtor chooses throughout their life. So someone who's 30 or 40 years old can liquidate their -- their IRA account, whereas with a pension or profit-sharing plan, they don't have that kind of access --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Should we put any weight on the title, on the name? I mean, I -- I can't but thinking it's an individual retirement account. Was Congress trying to fool people? (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was the Federal Trade Commission? Should they investigate? What -- I mean, the -- the -- I think of it as an account that's basically aimed, at least Congress thought it was aimed, at retirement, which has usually to do with age.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the -- the name is clearly not determinative. Also, Congress in the -- in the --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm reading the statute and if I were voting on it and put in the 408 reference and think of the word individual retirement account, is there any -- I would have thought, knowing not that much about it, that of course, they'd be included. Now, is there any indication, when people passed this, that they didn't think they would be? Any -- any reference in the terrible words, legislative history, that might shed light on it?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. First of all, Congress did historically reject, first of all, just tax-favored status overall, such as what an IRA account is. An IRA account is set up just for tax-favored status. Congress set forth, instead, the (d)(10)(e) -- 522(d)(10)(e) requirements that -- that are much more stringent in the requirements of the traditional IRA.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3820 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, are they? Because there was one statement -- I think it was in Ms. Karlan's brief -- that the Fifth Circuit said profit-sharing plans permit participants to withdraw up to the entire amount on payment of the penalty. So a profit-sharing plan, which was one of the ones on the list, seems to be substantially identical if you can also take out, whenever you like, as long as you're willing to pay the penalty.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3821 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a misnomer that that's a -- a right to payment. That is rather the right to borrow as a loan. And a loan is very different than a right to payment. They have the right to borrow the funds. However -- for example, in the New York Police Department pension plan, which she referenced in the reply brief, the police officers can borrow up to 90 percent of their pension plan funds. However, they -- as long as they're employed there, they have to continue to repay that.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What -- what if they don't repay it? What's the sanction?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is a 10 percent penalty. However, as the bankruptcy --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what -- where -- where would the -- where would the principal repayment come from? I assume it would come from deducting whatever the balance was from the -- the person's account.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That would be correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3826 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, we call it -- the -- the loan feature then boils down to a -- a withdrawal subject to a periodic repayment obligation, but if that obligation is not satisfied, the bottom line will be exactly like a withdrawal because they will simply deduct whatever the balance is from the person's rights under the plan.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Plus 10 percent you say.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. However --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it's just -- just like an IRA.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but this is in the bankruptcy context, which makes it completely different. The bankruptcy filing of a chapter VII bankruptcy is a picture in time. At the time that the debtor files the bankruptcy petition, you look to the assets that the debtor has possession of and the interest that the debtor has at that moment. There's also, for some things, a 1-year look-back period. But because it's a picture in time, it's what the -- the debtor can reach is what the -- the bankruptcy trustee looks to, the types of assets that -- that the debtor owns. This is very different than the pension plan which, of course, the debtor could not have -- have exhausted to pay the creditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, but any other type of account would be there, would be present at the retirement. But because they could have liquidated their IRA's to pay off their creditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee steps into the shoes of that debtor and has the ability to reach the funds that the debtor can potentially reach. There are other exemptions, of course, set forth in -- in section 522(d), you know, for a home or jewelry, but the assets that are not exempt are readily available to repay creditors, for -- for the benefit of the creditors. Therefore, that -- that makes it significantly --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Subject to the 10 percent if the bankruptcy trustee does that?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the penalty still has to be paid even if it's the trustee who takes money out to pay the creditors, on your view.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. Yes, they do. They do. Additionally, the petitioners' IRA's are -- by allowing unfettered access, are unlike any of the other plans because the petitioners' standard IRA is much more like a savings account. It's not any form of deferred compensation. They can't look to that to fill a salary void after they retire because the money may not be there. Unlike in the pension plans or a profit-sharing plan, they could have liquidated those funds prior to their reaching any age or any illness that -- that may befall them.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there -- there is no penalty attached to withdrawing from a savings account, and there's also no limit on the annual contribution.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. That is correct. That is correct. But the -- the key here --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me just get -- get straight what -- what the -- what the universe of plans we have in front of us here. Do you assert that there are no other plans, clearly covered by this statute, that permit withdrawal for any reason but with a penalty?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. None of the specified plans listed, the -- the ones enumerated.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would permit withdrawal for any reason whatever provided that a penalty is paid.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ None of them is like that.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ None of them is like that. They all have specific factors. There has to be a causal connection between the ability to access the money. Additionally, it's very important that -- that an account or plan that qualifies under the statute -- it has to be determined on a case-by-case basis. And there's no question that there are definitely IRA's that -- that could and do qualify for this exemption. It is, instead, that --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3843 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do -- do you disagree with Ms. Karlan that this is -- this is a standardized product so the people, the Rouseys of this world, really couldn't get a tailor-made IRA? They would have to take the standard product.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3844 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not -- that's not correct. There are many customizable products that are -- are out there. In fact, for example, when employers set up different kinds of plans for their employees, they go and they can choose from many different options. For example, they can choose if they even have a -- a loan provision built into a -- a 401(k) or a pension plan, just like the IRA. They -- they can be customized because section 408 only sets forth the minimum requirements for it to qualify for tax-favored status. That -- that is an Internal Revenue Code section, and it does not in any way prohibit additional factors being placed into the plan. Rather, it allows the -- the individual or the employer because some -- there are two different types of IRA's that can be set up by an employer -- to go and customize those so that they could potentially meet the statutory requirements.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3845 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ These -- these other plans that allow you to withdraw for certain reasons but not for any reason -- what happens if you withdraw for any reason?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3846 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3847 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is the sanction against -- I mean, you just go in. You withdraw the money for -- for a reason that is not allowed by the employer plan. What -- what is the sanction?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3848 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My understanding is that -- is that you cannot access the funds for a reason not allowed by those plans, that that is prohibited. And that -- that is similar to Ms. Andersen's IRA in the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel case. She could no longer reach the funds in the -- she could no longer reach the corpus of the account. The -- the lump sum of money was there for her retirement years. Whereas, in the IRA situation, the money is not protected at any time. There's no prohibition at all whatsoever on withdrawing the funds from the account other than the payment of the penalty. But whether an account or plan qualifies under the statute, it -- it -- you look at the language of the plan on a plan-by-plan basis. The petitioners' argument renders the terms of the statute superfluous because, first of all, it is dissimilar from the enumerated plans, and secondly, it is not on account of any factors that the money can be reached. The right to receive the payment is not based upon any factor other than the -- the account holder wanting to withdraw the funds.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3849 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The right to receive 100 percent is -- is dependent on a factor, isn't it?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3850 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, it is.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3851 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. At least as to the 10 percent that would be penalty, there's no right to get that money unless you have a certain age.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3852 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. Unless you have -- or another factor such as for education or for a home loan, something like that. There are several different reasons that you can -- you can reach the money and not pay a penalty. However, the penalty is not -- is not the deciding factor. It's their ability to access the funds at any time that -- that makes that a right of payment. It's not a right of payment without a penalty. It's just that the right to payment exists at all times.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3853 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You don't dispute that -- that it's a very small percentage of people who have IRA's, in fact, exercise the right to withdraw, given the penalty.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3854 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- that -- that is -- appears to be correct. I don't have those exact statistics, but yes, that -- that appears to be correct, that they have -- that they may not exercise that at -- in great numbers. First of all, going back to the causation factor about the -- the ability of the debtors to withdraw the funds for any reason or no reason, this Court in the 203 North LaSalle case determined that on account of must mean because of, and that -- that is a key point here because if the debtors can reach the funds for any reason, it is not because of any other factor. And in the LaSalle case, this Court found that that reading, the because of reading, absolutely applies to this section of the -- the Bankruptcy Code, that means that the result is that a direct causal connection is required between the right to receive the payment in the on account of requirements. In -- in this case there is no causal connection whatsoever between the right to receive the payments and -- and any of the factors enumerated in the statute.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3855 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The words, on account of, in this -- this statute are sort of unusual, no matter how you construe them, because really the payment is on account of the years of service or it's on account of a lot of things. You may become eligible at a certain time. It would be better if it said a payment for which you became eligible for one of these reasons because the payment isn't really on account of all of these things. You may get the same amount whether you're disabled or not depending on what the terms of the plan are.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3856 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. There are, of course, always some other factors, such as you have to first deposit the money, you have to become eligible. But once those barriers are passed, then -- then the right to receive the payment has to be at least -- one of the causes must be one of these factors. And it has to be enumerated in the plan. It cannot be for any reason, but must be an enumerated reason in the plan. And the -- with the penalty, only the avoidance of a penalty is based upon the -- the age of the debtor or the -- or any of the factors. It's -- section 522(d)(10)(e) is void of any reference to the tax status or to the right to receive the payment without penalty. It's only the right to receive the payment overall.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3857 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does your argument draw a ring around IRA's? It was suggested that if your argument prevails, then these other plans would be affected as well.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3858 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Only to the extent that -- that they are not payable for any of the reasons enumerated in the statute. If -- if they are available for payment at any time for any reason, then -- then they would not qualify. But the specified accounts, so long as they're payable for -- for one of the factors and that there's a direct nexus between the right to receive the payment and -- and the factors, then -- then they would qualify for the exemption. It is not, by any stretch, all IRA's. It is just the types that -- currently that the petitioners would have or that people would have that would allow the access at any time for any purpose. So it's not that the trustee is looking to have IRA's not be eligible for exemption. It's just the types of accounts from which all the funds can be withdrawn at any time for any purpose. There are many qualifying IRA's that do exist, that can exist. It's just that people have set these up from standard plans allowing them access. Whether they access the funds or not is not the key, but the ability to access the money because it doesn't meet the statutory requirements. There are several IRA's, though, that can and do meet the statutory requirements. It's just that the petitioners' don't. The case law in the Eighth Circuit was well settled, prior to the filing of this bankruptcy, that for approximately 12 years, that the definition of similar plan or contract did not include IRA's such as this, and that the on account of factors had to be satisfied to claim this exemption. The -- the debtors knew or -- or potentially should have known that -- that their IRA's were likely not exempt out of Eighth Circuit at the time that they filed because of the way that -- that these had been construed for a long period of time. So that they could have set up accounts that did qualify for such exemption, but -- but they did not restrict their access in that way. Thank you.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3859 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Ms. McKiever. Ms. Karlan, you have about 7 minutes. You're not required to use it all.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3861 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm going to retire early. (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3862 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the first point is that there are two rights under IRA's: the right after age 59 and a half or upon death or disability or illness to withdraw the money without any kind of penalty; and there's a second little exercise, an entirely subsidiary right, which is the ability to withdraw money subject to a penalty earlier. The existence of that second entirely subsidiary, almost never used right -- and the statistic on this is in the green brief at page 23 -- means that the real essence of an IRA is it is a plan on account of age. The second point. As this Court said last year --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3863 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You don't really have a right to receive it on account of age. You have a right to receive it without a penalty on account of age.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3864 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, at the age of --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3865 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It isn't the right to receive the money that depends on your age. It's the right to receive the money without paying a tax.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3866 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's a right that's very important because let me give you just a mathematical example of the difference.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3867 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is a right that's important, but it's not what the statute says. The statute says --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3868 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The statute gives that right.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3869 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the right to receive a payment on account of, among other things, age.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3870 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you do have that right. You also have another right. But the existence of that second right doesn't negate the first right. The statute doesn't here, for example, as section 522 or section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code does, use the word solely to say you -- a plan is eligible only if you have solely the right to receive on this --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3871 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but it lists the other reasons: on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service. And -- and, you know, when you have a list like that, you would think that the right to receive the money for some other reason doesn't -- doesn't qualify. I mean, I would think that that's --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3872 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That might be your first thought, but then --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3873 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or -- or at least -- at least some other reason that isn't closely related to those.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3874 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, but I think even if that were your first thought, you would then get to the implication that many of the Justices have been pressing today, which is the implication of that for all plans is tremendous because all plans give -- well, I shouldn't say all plans, but I should say the vast majority of other plans, 401(k) plans, profit-sharing plans, and the like, do give you early access to your money, and that's valuable to you. That's why in section --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3875 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it true that none of them give unfettered access? They're all qualified in some fashion. Do you agree with that?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3876 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the qualification of hardship has been interpreted by many employers to say, you want to buy a house and you can't otherwise? That's a hardship. You want to sent your kid to school and you can't otherwise? That's a hardship. You have huge, you know, consumer loans and you could consolidate that? That's a hardship. So it's not as if IRA's operate differently from everything else in the system. That's why --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3877 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, yes. You -- you don't have to make up a hardship. You just say I want the money. Okay, you want the money? Here's the money.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3878 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that's --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3879 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't even have to lie about the hardship. I mean -- (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3880 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I need the money. I don't have the money. That's a hardship. If you -- if all you have to say is the magic word hardship, I think that's why we would say IRA's are similar plans or contracts because this Court has made it clear similar is not the same thing as identical. So if similar reasons allow you to withdraw, that's enough. And that's why in section --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3881 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In any of these other plans, can you get the money so long as you're willing to pay a penalty?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3882 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As I read the New York City --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3883 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Without any qualification for disability, illness. No. I just want the money. Give me the money and I'll pay you 10 percent. Is there any plan that works like that?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3884 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know, but the New York City Police Department plan appears to work like that. You can take the money out if you pay the 10 percent penalty.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3885 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Has any judge ever taken the view that -- adopting Justice Scalia's approach, that while you can't put the whole IRA -- exempt the whole IRA, but you can exempt 10 percent of it?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3886 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not to my knowledge.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3887 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At least you ought to get that much, it seems to me, under his -- his analysis.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3888 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We'd be happier with 10 percent than nothing, but no judge has ever read the statute that way. The second point is a point that comes out of this Court's decision last year in the Till case where the Court said, look, you want to pick a manageable line, a line that's straightforward and familiar. And here's one that I'll give you that comes directly from the text of section 522(d)(10)(e), which is you should hold that section 522(d)(10)(e) permits the exemption of all plans or contracts that qualify under section 401(a), section 403(a), section 403(b), or section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, which IRA's do. And this may have led to some of the confusion, I think, between counsel in this case, which is in the Andersen case, although Ms. Andersen was receiving money under section 408, it was not a 408 individual retirement account. It was, instead, under section 403(b), an individual retirement annuity. So there are, as far as we know, no individual retirement accounts, the things you put money into while the money accumulates before you're ready to retire and you transfer it into an annuity that are customizable. And indeed, for the kinds of debtors who need the protections of section 522(d)(10)(e) the most, the unsophisticated people who are putting their money away in an IRA because their pension plan either doesn't exist at all or isn't adequate for their retirement, the idea that they would understand to go in and negotiate at a bank for a customizable IRA strikes me as quite implausible. That's why we think the most sensible reading of the statute here is to exempt IRA's when the money in them is necessary for the support of the debtor. Thank you.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3889 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. The case is submitted.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3893 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll now hear argument in the case of Muehler against Mena. Mr. Phillips.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3895 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: At issue in this case is the safety of police officers when they attempt to execute a search warrant in an inherently unsafe situation.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3896 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask one preliminary question, Mr. Phillips? Do we have before us here any question at all about qualified immunity?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3897 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we do believe that a qualified immunity issue is bound up with the underlying merits. It was addressed that way by the Ninth Circuit because --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3898 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it wasn't -- it wasn't in the questions --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3899 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This Court --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3900 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- on which we granted cert?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3901 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This Court in Procunier treated the qualified immunity issue as part and parcel of the underlying merits of the case and -- and, in fact, skipped over the question of what 1983 meant in order to address the qualified immunity issue. And presumably --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3902 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How -- how --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3903 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the Court could do the same thing here.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3904 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do we do it? It goes right to the heart of this from you, the qualified immunity thing, for the reason that if you look at the facts and circumstances, it sounds to me like a somewhat close question as to whether the police did or did not exceed the reasonable bounds -- reasonable bounds. Now, if it's a close question, you have a jury verdict against you, and -- and then I think, well, yes, but I begin to come -- become disturbed if I think of qualified immunity. I mean, it isn't that clear. So -- so having read through the thing, I -- I preliminarily start by thinking, well, it could have been excessive force, I mean, given -- you know, I'm using that in quotes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3905 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3906 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The jury said it was. Who am I to say it wasn't --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3907 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I mean, this -- this --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3908 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in that situation? But qualified immunity. So now, what do I do?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3909 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in the first instance, it's reasonably clear to me that you're not bound by the jury's determination here. This Court has already --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3910 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- don't we have to give any weight at all to the jury finding there or --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3911 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With respect to the historical facts of the case, who did what to whom, of course, you have -- that -- that's subject to clearly erroneous review. On the issue of whether or not the conduct at issue here is reasonable, that's an issue of law or at least a mixed issue of fact --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3912 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, a lot of it may depend on the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3913 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- and law that this Court has decided as de novo.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3914 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- on the music as to handcuffing and what did they say and what was the atmosphere and what was the garage really like and how risky was it that there be gang members in the outhouses and -- and all kinds of stuff that you might sense from the testimony.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3915 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it seems to me that -- Justice Breyer, that the answer to all of those questions go to the core of what it means to exercise unquestioned command of the situation, which is a pure legal standard that this Court adopted a quarter of a century ago in Michigan v. Summers. And that's a question of law. To be sure, there are lots of elements of it, but what my position would be -- and obviously the officers' position in this case -- is that in exercising unquestioned command, you can accept all of the facts as you've just described them and none of that is excessive because it doesn't expose anyone to anything other than what is necessary in order to achieve complete control under the circumstances in order to ensure the protection of the individual officers and -- and candidly of the other individuals who were being -- being detained, all four of them, under these circumstances.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3916 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Have you responded to my initial question? Have you said all you want to say about qualified immunity?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3917 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice O'Connor. My -- my basic answer to that is that this Court already addressed that issue in Procunier. It considered that the qualified immunity issue was part and parcel of the issue, even though it hadn't been presented in the question presented, and indeed, I think in this case it's actually a -- a stronger argument that qualified immunity is in this case because that is the way that the Ninth Circuit specifically addressed the issue. It looked at under Saucier. It evaluated whether or not qualified immunity was appropriate and -- and did the two-part test, the first part being whether it was a constitutional violation and the second part whether or not it was reasonable under these particular circumstances. So if I -- if I cannot persuade you that this is constitutional, which obviously I -- I hope I can do, it seems to me absolutely unquestioned that there -- that what the officers did here under these circumstances were perfectly reasonable.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3918 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what is the -- what is the function of a jury in this case? What does the jury verdict stand for? And the jury doesn't return a special verdict and says we find X, Y, and Z. It finds whether the police exercised excessive force, and that's all we know from the jury verdict. Other -- I think what you're saying is that these cases should go off on summary judgment or even a demurrer. You assume all the facts as the plaintiff alleges them and then the Court decides whether that adds up to unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3919 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I'm not saying that that would be true in all cases. I do think in this particular case you did not need to have a jury verdict. We would have been prepared to stipulate to the facts as they were found ultimately and -- and giving the benefit of all of the inferences to the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3920 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't know the fact -- what facts were found because all we have is in the jury verdict that this was excessive force. Period. That's all.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3921 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's just a conclusion of law, Justice Ginsburg. So the -- the facts that you know are the facts as they're described --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3922 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's like was --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3923 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- by the respondent's brief.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3924 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the defendant negligent. Is that more or less a conclusion of law? We don't know in what respect from the jury verdict. And here, were these police officers acting -- did they use excessive force.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3925 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we know precisely what they did. They kept her in handcuffs throughout the duration of the -- of the search. We know that. There's no -- there are no additional claims as to having mistreated her physically.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3926 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wasn't there a fact issue as to whether she was handcuffed for -- even for a short period after the search had been completed?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3927 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think there is a factual question like that because I don't think that question was presented to the jury, and it was certainly not the basis on which the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict in this case. There -- there was never an argument made to the jury that this -- that this extended beyond the -- the period of the end of the search. The argument that was made to the jury was that the search should have -- should have been limited to the room where the suspect was -- was a resident or that the police should have made a decision somewhere in the -- before the end of the 2-hour search that she was no longer a threat to them. And then they were arguing that -- that it even went a little further in terms of the timing of it. But they never asked the jury to find that that 15 minutes was the basis for a Fourth Amendment violation in its own right.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3928 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if -- but if it made a difference as a matter of law, what -- what should we assume about that extra 15 minutes? Do we assume that they found the facts in the way that the -- a plaintiff argues them or that you think they are?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3929 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think if the jury had been asked to make that finding, that you -- and -- and the jury determined that there -- that it was unreasonable, then I think you'd have to conclude that the 15 minutes were, in fact -- that it did, in fact, go beyond 15 minutes. I do think there is still a legal issue as to whether that's de minimis under the circumstances. But -- but I agree. I mean, obviously there is a role for the jury's findings, and you have to give them a certain amount of respect. But on the core questions of reasonableness and suspicion and whether or not the police exercised unquestioned command and what those terms mean, this Court has already decided that in the Fourth Amendment context it has to decide those issues as a matter of law to regulate the conduct of all police officers and not simply do it on the basis of whatever a particular jury would say in a particular circumstance.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3930 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, in doing it as a matter of law here, should we give consideration to the fact that in this case, if -- if I remember correctly, one of the officers testified that had they followed normal protocol, once they had, I think his phrase was, secured the building, the -- the main building --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3931 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the -- all of the grounds actually.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3932 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that the whole compound?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3933 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3934 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that they would have -- they would have taken off the immediate restraints, and he wasn't sure why they didn't. We -- do we -- do we consider that when we're crafting our statement of law as -- as to what is or is not excessive?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3935 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think if this Court could determine that, as a matter of course, the -- the standard operating procedures in a particular way, that might certainly inform the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis. That -- I think what's important to keep in mind in this context, though, Justice Souter, is we're talking about four individuals who are being detained under these circumstances, and each of them poses a distinct issue for the police officers under the -- under -- when trying to decide how best to proceed. One of them had been found with marijuana in his possession. One of them had been determined to be an illegal alien, and the other two were individuals about whom the police knew virtually nothing. So, you know, is it possible that police procedure, generally speaking, when you're talking about a single occupant of the residence, oftentimes concludes that he can take away -- you can remove the handcuffs? That may be, although I don't think there's much in the record here to -- to reflect that. But what the police said here -- and I think it's extraordinarily important. Officer Muehler testified that if something had gone wrong, if either a police officer had been injured or one of the occupants of that house had been shot or otherwise harmed as a -- in the context of executing the search warrant, the first question that would have been asked is what was the least that could have been done to prevent those injuries from occurring. And he said to himself and he said it quite rightly -- and it's a rule this Court ought to embrace under the unquestioned command theory of -- of law -- is that if we keep them in handcuffs through the duration of a reasonable search, we will make our way through the search much more rapidly, much more efficiently in order to minimize the detention and we will eliminate -- and I mean, literally eliminate -- the entirety of the risk either to the individuals themselves, the occupants, the detainees, or to the police under these circumstances.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3936 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. I take it you obviously don't want us to -- to come down with a kind of a finicky version of -- of excessive force as the touchstone, and I take it you don't want us to come down with simply a blanket rule saying that essentially the police can do anything in -- in restraining occupants so long as it is not wantonly cruel. Somewhere in between. Do you have a -- a statement that would be the kernel of the holding that you want?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3937 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm -- I'm quite comfortable with the way the Court analyzed it in Michigan v. Summers, that the officer is not required to evaluate the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure. That is, you -- you have a categorical rule that allows you, in the ordinary course, to do whatever is reasonably necessary in order to --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3938 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But in the facts there, there were no handcuffs. He -- he was just detained. So --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3939 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand that, and -- but my -- my position is that handcuffs don't materially affect the detention under these circumstances other than to assure what the Court said, which is unquestioned command of the situation.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3940 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- I mean, I don't -- would -- would you say handcuffs are per se lawful for -- for purposes of applying Summers?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3941 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but it's important to put that in context because Summers is a narrow exception to the -- not an exception. It's a narrow circumstance under the Fourth Amendment. You have to have a search warrant. It has to be a validly issued search warrant so that we know that there has either been a crime that's likely to be taking place in the premises. It only -- it only extends to the residents, occupants of the house, and it's only when the search is for contraband, not just for any evidence. So, for instance, when the police go the 60th time to Michael Jackson's estate to go try to find evidence of whatever is going on there, I don't think it's reasonable to go in and handcuff Michael Jackson and anybody else who happens to be on site.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3942 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it doesn't -- why is contraband magical? Wouldn't -- wouldn't your point be when -- when the reason they're investigating gives cause to believe that there may be physical danger --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3943 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3944 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- from letting people wander around?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3945 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- absolutely.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3946 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which is the case with contraband, but would be the case for many other reasons as well.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3947 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think the important point here is that we're talking about guns. These are gangs. These are guns. This is a circumstance that is inherently more dangerous than any other circumstance the police are likely to confront.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3948 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But would you be happy then with a holding that says just what you said? We reaffirm Summers and -- but Summers said special circumstances or possibly a prolonged detention might lead to a different conclusion in an unusual case. And the only verdict part that I think we're concerned with here -- it was not about four people. It was one person, Iris Mena, and in respect to Iris Mena, the jury found that there was a violation of her -- of her Fourth Amendment rights. And as to her, you could have found -- you said -- I don't know if you misspoke. You said it could be more than 15 minutes. In looking at it, I was certain whether they kept her for 15 minutes more or more than 15 minutes more, maybe up to an hour more beyond the time that the search ended and kept her in handcuffs, both after the time they had secured the place and also after the time the search ended. Well, that would seem a basis for the jury's verdict and consistent with Summers.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3949 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- it could have been a basis for the jury's verdict if they had, in fact, put the issue of whether or not they were detained --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3950 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Mr. -- Mr. -- but may I point out that the judge's instructions did put that issue to the jury at page 203. A police officer is required to release an individual detained in connection with a lawful search as soon as the officer's right to conduct the search ends or the search itself is concluded, whichever is sooner.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3951 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. That -- I understand that, Justice Stevens, but the point we made in our reply brief is there's not a shred of evidence in this record and it was never argued to the jury that this search -- that -- that her detention lasted beyond the period of the search in this case. Indeed, counsel for the police officers specifically said in his closing argument, there is no issue but that she was released at the time of the -- that when -- as soon as the search was -- was ended, the -- the warrant was executed.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3952 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I wonder why the judge gave this instruction then.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3953 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because -- because what he's -- well, you know, it's a reasonable instruction.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3954 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And why -- why there was -- there was a special verdict of sorts, not a detailed one. But the two questions, question 5 and question 6, on page 255 of the joint appendix --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3955 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3956 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ One question concerns whether the force was excessive, and the other one is, do you find that she was detained for a longer period than reasonable? Those two questions -- my first is a procedural question. Did counsel for the defendants object to the jury getting -- those two questions being submitted to the jury?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3957 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Ginsburg. We didn't. And -- and --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3958 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it seems to me that the judge is asking the jury in these questions, one is whether there was a -- a detention, was force greater than was reasonable under the circumstances, and whether the duration was longer than reasonable under the circumstances.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3959 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. Justice Ginsburg, you have to put that in context. The argument of the plaintiff in this case was that the detention should have ended at either of two points: after they had completely cleared the area and made it safe, or alternatively, at some point after that when they had asked her questions and determined that she had no particular involvement with Mr. Romero. Their argument was anything after that was unreasonable, and that's what the jury certainly found, was that that was the reasonable break point. Our argument is that's not consistent with the notion of unquestioned command and -- and is wrong as a matter of law. And there is no evidence -- no evidence. There was no testimony that she was kept for a period beyond the execution of that search warrant. It's very important to understand that.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3960 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you're saying that the -- the mere fact that it -- it went to the jury, even went to the jury without your objecting to it, does not mean we have to listen to what the jury said. Is that -- is that --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3961 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. If it's wrong as a matter of law, that's -- then that's absolutely right. But there was no evidence in this case that they kept going. The only thing he said was, he -- he didn't remember. That was -- the question was put to the police officer. Was she kept beyond there? He said he didn't remember. He wasn't even the police officer who was involved in it. There's not a shred of evidence of that. It's totally made up. It wasn't their theory of the case in front of the jury. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3962 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You might save your time. Yes. Mr. Shanmugam.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3964 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: When executing a search warrant to investigate a violent crime, officers may routinely use reasonable restraints on detained occupants in order to exercise unquestioned command over the situation and to facilitate the orderly completion of the search. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the officers' use of handcuffs in this case violated the Fourth Amendment. Under the standard for excessive force claims first articulated by this Court in Graham v. Connor, as informed by this Court's decision in Michigan v. Summers, the degree of force used here was not excessive. The same considerations that justified the detention of the occupants in Summers, most notably, the paramount concern of ensuring the safety of the officers and the occupants themselves, will ordinarily justify the precautionary use of handcuffs during the detention.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3965 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then this case should not have gone to the jury on the basis of what you said --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3966 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3967 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- because you -- you just said that this -- the handcuffs -- the circumstances -- the circumstances here were reasonable as a matter of law.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3968 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. It is our view that as a matter of law, the officers would have been entitled to prevail on the constitutional issue with regard to excessive force. And it's worth noting, I think, that the officers did move for summary judgment. They also orally moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence, and that motion was denied. Now, we also believe that the jury, quite frankly, was given insufficient guidance on the excessive force issue, and to turn to the jury instruction cited by Justice Stevens at page 203, it's quite clear that the jury only received one very general instruction on Summers detentions.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3969 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- well, has the -- the objection to the instruction been preserved here?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3970 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Perhaps an argument could be made that it's fairly included within the questions presented. There was an objection made at trial and an objection made before the Ninth Circuit as well, but our fundamental position is that the jury was simply given insufficient guidance on the excessive force issue. This instruction --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3971 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But on the -- on the question whether they preserved the issue, I -- I took it, implicit in what you said a minute ago, that yes, they did not object to the submission of the question. They did not object, in effect, to an instruction or giving of an instruction as such.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3972 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3973 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But they -- they had moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence, and that's enough to preserve the issue?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3974 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that's true. It is true that they didn't object to the specific special verdict set of questions. I think they proposed slightly different language. But ultimately I think our primary submission is that as a matter of law on these facts, no constitutional violation occurred.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3975 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ When you -- is your objection that the jury wasn't given enough guidance on excessive force, or is it that the -- that the ultimate issue of excessive force is not a jury issue?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3976 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We would concede, I think, Justice Scalia, that the issue should go to the jury where there are disputed issues of historical fact. We would submit that there are no relevant --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3977 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but is -- is excessive force an issue of historical fact any more than -- than unreasonable search or unreasonable seizure is an issue of historical fact?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3978 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there are certain --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3979 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's historical fact how long you held the person, whether the person was in handcuffs, but the ultimate question was, you know, is this force excessive. Is that any different from the question as -- of was this seizure unreasonable? If you submit the one to the jury, you may as well submit the other.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3980 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, those facts may be disputed in a particular case. We would submit that they really weren't disputed here, but there may actually be a dispute where the officers would say, yes, we used handcuffs and the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3981 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So when --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3982 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- or no we didn't use handcuffs.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3983 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- when you know all those facts, you're willing to send it to the jury to say, given all of these facts, it's up to you to decide whether unreasonable force was used or not.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3984 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We believe that it is --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3985 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's not a matter of law.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3986 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- a mixed question of fact and law, and once the historical facts are established, it is essentially --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3987 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why -- why any more so -- why any -- any more so than -- than whether it's an unreasonable seizure?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3988 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we would submit that it is no different from the question whether officers had probable cause or reasonable suspicion on any given set of historical facts which this Court held in Ornelas was a question subject to de novo review, over your dissent, admittedly. And we believe that the primary rationale for the rule in Ornelas also applies here, namely that officers do need to have a consistent set of substantive guidelines by which they can judge the validity of their conduct.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3989 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are -- are you saying that the only basis on -- on which the jury could have ruled for the homeowner here, the -- the respondent, is that she was handcuffed for too long?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3990 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We believe that that certainly is the primary issue that was at stake. And in fact --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3991 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think you have to say that. Otherwise, we have to uphold the jury verdict, if we can assume that the jury might have thought, well, you know, the handcuffs -- the police had a right to do that, but she was held too long, she was -- they -- they yelled at her, she was taken into a -- a place that was uncomfortable. If -- if that's true, then we have to sustain the jury verdict.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3992 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that the handcuffing was the key factor at trial, and I think that the best evidence of that, quite frankly, is that respondent in her proposed instructions referred only to handcuffing in her excessive force instruction. Unfortunately, that's not part of the joint appendix. It is part of the record.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3993 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. But the instruction that was given -- and one was read that's in the briefs -- it seems to me a -- a perfectly good instruction.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3994 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that that's true, but I think that the instruction didn't really provide any guidance on excessive force specifically. It was really an instruction with regard to the reasonableness of the detention more generally, rather than with regard to excessive force specifically. It was not a Graham v. Connor type instruction.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3995 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, then it seems to me it was the plaintiff's obligation to submit a clarifying instruction and to bring this -- the denial of that instruction here.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3996 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there were objections to the instruction below, and all I can say is that perhaps an argument could be made -- and perhaps Mr. Phillips will make the argument on rebuttal -- that it is fairly included within the questions presented.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3997 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know how you can -- you can say that the only thing that was before the jury was the handcuff when the -- there was evidence that she was treated very roughly in -- in the first instance, she was woken from her sleep, she wasn't told that they were police, she thought they were robbers, and she feared for her life. That doesn't drop out of the case and what the jury was asked to determine.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3998 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, it was the primary issue before the jury, and to be sure, there were other issues. I think that the other relevant use of force was the initial detention at gunpoint, but -- and those -- and I would add that those are the two factors on which the Ninth Circuit relied in affirming the jury's verdict. Our submission is that both with regard to the initial use of force and with regard to the continued use of force, the justifications of Graham v. Connor support the officers' use of force in both instances.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3999 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but may I just ask a sort of very basic question? One of the instructions reads, a detention may be unreasonable if it -- if it is unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or if it involves an undue invasion of privacy. Now, are you telling us that you think the answer to that question is a question of law that the judge should provide rather than the jury?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4000 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Assuming that that instruction is correct -- and that might very well be a valid instruction --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4001 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it was correct.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4002 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It may very well be a correct instruction --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4003 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4004 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- with regard to a challenge to the manner of the detention itself. In that instance, then the jury does have a certain amount of leeway, but I think even then the teaching of Ornelas --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4005 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then it's not a question of law. The answer to whether it was unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or involved undue invasion of privacy, is that a question of law or a question of fact to the jury?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4006 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is a mixed question of law and fact, and the jury's job is --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4007 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's a mixed question?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4008 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The jury's job is to -- to resolve the underlying factual issues and then --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4009 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I understand the historical fact, but I'm -- I'm questioning you about the conclusions that you draw from the unreasonableness, degrading, and so forth. Is that partly to be decided by the jury or entirely by the judge?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4010 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We believe that that actually is ultimately a judge issue in the same way that the issue of whether or not probable --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4011 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So this instruction should not have been given.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4012 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4024 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where -- where is that testimony?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4025 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The testimony -- Officer Brill's testimony? Is actually -- they cite joint appendix number -- on 75 where he says he doesn't recall. On the next page, in joint appendix number 76, he's asked -- they continue to ask the question. And isn't it your memory that about 10 or 15 minutes after that, Iris Mena was released? That would sound consistent. And that's 10 or 15 minutes after 8:57. In addition, Ms. Mena testified that she was kept between 2 or 3 hours, and that was actually consistent with prior testimony by the videographer herself, who testified in deposition and was impeached at trial, that it was 2 or 3 hours that the search lasted. The -- the point being -- and if you take the distance between Officer Muehler's testimony and Officer Brill's testimony, Ms. Mena was -- was kept in handcuffs at the end of a very long detention in handcuffs, for a period of approximately 27 to 33 minutes, if you don't even take Ms. Mena's testimony into account. And one of the ironies of the case is that there's testimony that Mr. Romero, the actual target of the case, was released at 8:45 at the time the search ended. And so while this --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4026 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But not from these premises.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4027 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. But in fact, this was a -- the search warrant was for two premises. He was picked up at his mother's house. And in fact, Officer Muehler had -- was -- was to radio the start of both searches, and so there was --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4028 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the -- the -- I thought that this poorhouse, or whatever it was called -- that the warrant covered weapons that were there.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4029 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4030 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That they were looking for weapons.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4031 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They were looking for a gun.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4032 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They were not looking for a gun at Romero's mother's house, were they?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4033 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4034 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did they have a warrant, a search warrant?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4035 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the warrant covered -- I think they were looking for the gun wherever it was found, and -- and the -- I believe the warrant --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4036 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, this was a -- this was a pretty extensive search warrant that they had.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4037 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4038 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did they have something like that, the same kind of warrant for the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4039 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's the same warrant I believe, Your Honor, in terms of -- we don't have -- there's not a lot of information in the record about --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4040 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, wasn't -- I thought that this warrant referred to a particular address, a particular house, not -- not any house where one might find Romero.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4041 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no. It -- it referred to the two houses, one on Cimmaron.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4042 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, was the other house his mother's house?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4043 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. The location number one is his mother's house, 2646 Cimmaron, and that's -- and Officer Muehler and this team was in charge of both of these searches pursuant to the same warrant. They had information that -- the reason they did that is that they had information that -- that he lived in this poorhouse, that he rented a room from the Menas at the poorhouse, and that he also visited his -- his mother from time to time.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4044 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then that would make it even more curious if the place where the dangerous man was wasn't searched extensively and -- and the mother -- nobody was put in handcuffs, and yet for this -- they knew pretty soon that Romero wasn't on the premises.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4045 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they knew right away.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4046 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. And that's, I guess, your -- your point, that the place where the dangerous man was is not --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4047 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that that explains one of the reasons why the jury imposed punitive damages here because they -- they knew that at 8:45, at the time that Officer Muehler said that the search was over and all the officers were out of the house and -- and everything was done, that Mr. Romero was cited and released for marijuana possession. And at the same time, from 8:45 until sometime after 9 o'clock, probably as long as 30, maybe longer, Iris Mena was sitting in a cold, damp, converted garage with her hands behind her back.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4048 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You might be able to keep your verdict, I -- I think. But I think the problem here is the Ninth Circuit -- you go to the Ninth Circuit and you say, you know, there was excessive force here on anybody's definition for reasons that you say. And -- and the Ninth Circuit says, oh, it was a clear violation of the Constitution and we'll tell you why, and then they give some reasons. And two of those reasons are, A, four and a half pages written the reason that this was unconstitutional is because they asked her questions about her immigration status, which you -- I don't think you even raised. Maybe you did. But anyway, that's -- that's the bulk of the -- of -- of -- that's the bulk of the analysis. And -- and these are the words that I think they're objecting to. And by any standard of reasonableness, Mena was -- the -- the officers should have released her from the handcuffs when it became clear that she posed no immediate threat. And that was long before the -- the -- because she wasn't a threat. And that was long before the end of the search. And what their point is on that is, you know, if that's the rule, that's going to interfere with our SWAT teams because they can't operate that way. They -- they can't evaluate the individual. They put the individual -- if there are guns and gangs and danger that she'll grab a gun, they put her in handcuffs, and they hold her there for the search for a couple of hours, then they release her. Now, that's their argument. So they're objecting not so much to -- to the fact they have to pay $30,000 -- or they may object to that. But they're -- they're objecting to the holding of the Ninth Circuit, and if they're right on that, then I guess we have to send it back and say, do this over again, though I'll be sorry about that and maybe there is a way not to do it. But -- but I want to know your view of what I see as those two issues here, that the Ninth Circuit's analysis was wrong.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4049 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I mean, first of all, I'd -- I'd say that the -- the Court could affirm the judgment in this case and the verdict in this case on the ground that we --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4050 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but then we can't really reach the issue. That's a possibility. I see that.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4051 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And in fact -- and I -- I think that would be the appropriate thing to do.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4052 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but then suppose that the reason that this case is here is because of the implications --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4053 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4054 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- of the Ninth Circuit's analysis --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4055 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4056 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- not necessarily the extra 30 minutes because I see your point on the extra 30 minutes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4057 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think -- I think that there -- I would divide my response to that, Justice Breyer, into two parts really. On the questioning issue, I would just say that that -- that was not an issue that was presented to the jury for its verdict as a separate Fourth Amendment violation. It wasn't. And we didn't argue it in the Ninth Circuit. What we did -- we did say in our -- in our brief to the Ninth Circuit that she was questioned about her immigration status about an issue that was unrelated to -- to Summers detention. We did say that.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4058 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we could say is their opinion -- that's their opinion. It's beside the point, et cetera.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4059 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. So, I mean, I -- I think on questioning, you know, we -- we haven't been pushing that issue.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4060 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if two of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit gave are in our view incorrect, why wouldn't we reverse and remand for them to do it without -- to make the judgment without taking those two factors into account?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4061 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think what -- first of all, it's a separate alternative holding. What they said is that there was a separate Fourth Amendment violation while they affirmed on the basis that we actually won on. The jury found that she had been detained longer than was reasonable and with more force than was reasonable. This is a jury verdict. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that. And we've argued in our brief that if the Court did something on questioning, it would really be issuing an advisory opinion in this -- in this situation. And, you know, we've -- we've argued the point and we're prepared certainly to argue about the merits of that question because it's obviously an important question. In our view, the questioning issue should be governed by the more traditional Terry kind of idea that you can't question when it goes beyond the scope of the limited purposes of the intrusion, but we also understand that that's contested.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4062 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4063 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4064 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- well, it does seem to me that --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4065 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Excuse me.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4066 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it does seem -- seem to me that the Ninth Circuit's opinion is questionable on -- on this key point of when she had to be released. The officers should have released her when it became clear she posed no immediate threat and did not resist arrest.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4067 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4068 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that is critical to its holding.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4069 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4070 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that implies that they have a -- a duty at the outset to determine whether -- what her status is rather than to go around looking for guns and -- and to secure the premises. That's -- that's one of my concerns with that.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4071 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I would have a different position on that. First of all, I think that the judgment can actually be affirmed on the first ground regardless of this issue because it was a -- a jury verdict and -- and the damages were asked for either/or in terms of question 5 or 6.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4083 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. They searched that room. So the room was searched before they went there. They searched all the rooms. They searched Ms. Mena's room and found absolutely nothing there. And -- and the testimony -- and this goes to Justice Souter's question.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4084 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did they -- did they search the individuals too to make sure --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4085 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4086 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I assume they did.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4087 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, yes. They -- they searched the individuals. They -- they -- you know, they completely made sure that -- that when they put them in that back room, there was nothing in the room. There was nothing on the individuals. There was nothing that -- that could cause them danger. And -- and the jury, I think, was entitled to -- to look at those facts and -- and to hear the facts and to see the facts --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4088 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How did the qualified immunity question get resolved here?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4089 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4090 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what -- what role did that play in all of this?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4091 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, at the -- at the district court level, the -- the district court heard a rule 59. But one of the things about this case is it was tried right around the time that Saucier v. Katz came out, and in the Ninth Circuit, there was a question about who got to decide qualified immunity. This was June 2001 actually. And so there was a rule 59 motion about whether the proper standard of qualified immunity had been applied. The district judge, looking at the facts, found that there were facts to sustain the verdict, including evidence that Ms. Mena had been kept after the end of the search. The district judge found that. And then in -- in the Ninth Circuit, of course, the Ninth Circuit's published opinion deals with qualified immunity on both of these issues. And basically the -- the qualified immunity -- on the -- on the over-detention claim, I think they've conceded that there just isn't any justification for -- I mean, a de minimis exception doesn't extend to 30 minutes. I mean, that -- this Court has debated whether 15 or 20 is too long on a -- on a Terry stop when there's actually reasonable suspicion. Here, there's nothing to hold her. With respect to the handcuffing issue --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4092 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it clear that it was 30?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4093 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think in viewing the light most favorable to the verdict, I think the Court has to assume that -- that the jury could have found an hour. But what I'm saying is based on the officer's own testimony alone, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, it's at least 27 to 32. And so you've got something that just could not possibly be considered de minimis under any kind of exception. And -- and that's why they fought it on the facts. They haven't even made an argument on the law at any point in this. And with respect to handcuffing, I think our position on the handcuffing is that Summers, first of all, doesn't deal with handcuffing. And the other side has consistently tried to equate detention with restraint. And I think what -- what Summers indicated was that this Court was willing to allow people to be detained during the course of a search for three specific reasons. And when balancing the nature of the intrusion against the justifications, this Court specifically said it was endorsing a limited intrusion, and that it wouldn't be very much different asking someone to sit around --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4094 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Doesn't that just go to the point that it's not clearly established at least?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4095 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, no. I -- I don't think that is the case, Justice Kennedy, because in -- in -- Summers doesn't authorize what they did. Graham certainly talks about having to justify force based on a -- on a Fourth Amendment analysis. And Franklin v. Foxworth, which is a Ninth Circuit case that happened before this case, the Court, first of all, used the -- the analysis that we have argued is appropriate based on Summers and Graham to decide that a particular Summers detention was carried out in an unreasonable manner.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4096 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but that was ill individual, a single individual --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4097 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4098 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- unclothed, et cetera --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4099 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I -- I understand that the facts were more egregious, but the -- the Court's analysis for a reasonable officer from a qualified immunity standpoint -- for a reasonable officer reading that opinion, you draw at least three conclusions I think. One is that the proper analysis to determine whether handcuffing or some additional form of restraint is -- is allowed has to be decided under the kinds of justifications that Summers provides and under a Graham analysis when it comes to force. And there's lots of cases that -- that allow officers to do that. Lots of lower court cases. In fact, our view is all the lower court cases follow that kind of analysis and just come out differently depending on the facts and circumstances confronted. The second thing, the -- the point about the disabled person and the particular facts made that case particularly egregious, and the Ninth Circuit said those were additional factors, not the line. The Ninth Circuit didn't say that the constitutional standard was particularly abusive or egregious. It -- it applied traditional Fourth Amendment analysis. And finally and I think very important and not dealt with maybe in the briefs as much as it should be is that the Ninth Circuit in -- in Franklin rejected a blanket handcuffing policy. That's what the policy was in Portland. The Portland police department had a policy that said you are to handcuff everybody until the search is over. And the Ninth Circuit said you can't have that kind of policy because Summers and -- and Graham require it to be individualized justification for that -- for an additional intrusion beyond the limited intrusion that's allowed in Summers. And in fact, in Summers, the Court went out of its way to say to compare with what the Court was allowing to what it -- to -- to the circumstances in Dunaway, to -- to circumstances that start to look like an arrest. And I don't know how much more intrusive you could be than what these officers did to Iris Mena, and I think that's one of the -- the issues here. If -- if the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what do we do if we think the Ninth Circuit was off base in -- in whether Mena could be questioned about her immigration status?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I think that --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That seemed to be an important part of the Ninth Circuit's rule.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's certainly -- it's certainly an alternative ground. It's not -- it doesn't affect, I think, our verdict. And so I think what -- I mean, I suppose the Court could dismiss that question as improvidently granted, could say to the court that it -- that it should reverse that part of the ruling.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4104 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It might be useful to say they were wrong in --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4105 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that -- you -- you could say that. I mean, I would -- on the merits of the question, I -- I would like to -- if we were reaching that, I would argue that the Ninth Circuit -- that -- that there is -- there should be a limit on questioning in a -- in a Summers detention, and the Court should apply the kind of Terry analysis that the majority of the -- the circuits apply.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4106 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What -- what will do if we thought the Ninth Circuit was egregiously wrong on that and that its opinion was, to use the most polite word, disingenuous when it talked about a garage? That -- that was somewhat off-putting to me when it was a converted garage with a bed.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4107 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I mean --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the jury --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- their theory of the case, and that's what the Ninth Circuit said, is yes, we do have that affirmative obligation.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the jury answered the -- just the general question, was the duration unreasonable, and the jury said yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not of the search. Of her detention.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, of her detention. And that was based on the jury's determination that we had detained her beyond the period we had done the sweep.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So if the district court got it right and the Ninth Circuit wrote a poor opinion, why should we upset the judgment in the case? In other words, if what we had here was a trial that was okay, a district judge that behaved -- gave a proper charge, then the Ninth Circuit writes an opinion that doesn't seem to deal with what the district court and the jury decided.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the -- the court of appeals' obligation here was to evaluate our argument that we should -- we were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court of appeals put forth what it regarded as the most legitimate bases on which to affirm the judgment in this case. The fact that neither of those withstand serious scrutiny, Justice Ginsburg, seems to me to be a basis for reversing the Ninth Circuit and allowing the matter to go back at this point. And -- and that is exactly what this Court does in -- you know, said it will do in Ornelas, that it is a de novo review. Punitive damages, exactly like a punitive damages cases. Juries make punitive damages determinations every day and every day courts of appeals and trial judges review those damages awards de novo because they -- because the question is not just what are the historical facts -- that you give deference to the jury on -- but on the fundamental question of what is the rule of law that will govern the police officers in the execution of search warrants in circumstances like this. They need protection, Your Honor. Thank you.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Phillips. The case is submitted.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4129 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We will now hear argument in Gonzales, et al. against Raich. General Clement.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4131 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Through the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has comprehensively regulated the national market in drugs with the potential for abuse. And with respect to Schedule I substances, like marijuana, that have both a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in treatment, Congress categorically prohibits interstate trafficking outside the narrow and carefully controlled confines of federally approved research programs.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Mr. Clement, the -- I think it is reasonably clear that Congress spoke very broadly in the Act, and the question, for me, turns on whether Lopez and Morrison dictate some concerns with its application in this context.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, I don't think either Lopez or Morrison casts any doubt on the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act, and I think, in particular, that's because the decisions in Lopez and Morrison cited, with approval, cases like Darby and Wickard, and preserved those cases. And, of course, the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy did so, as well.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but in Wickard, of course, you had a wheat grower, a small farmer, and his wheat did, in part, go in the national market. You don't have that here. As I understand it, if California's law applies, then none of this home-grown for medical-use marijuana will be on any interstate market. And it is in the area of something traditionally regulated by states. So how do you distinguish Morrison? And how do you distinguish Lopez?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice O'Connor, let me first say that I think it might be a bit optimistic to think that none of the marijuana that's produced consistent with California law would be diverted into the national market for marijuana. And, of course, the Controlled Substances Act is concerned, at almost every step of the Act, with a concern about diversion, both of lawful substances from medical to non-medical uses and from controlled substances under Schedule I into the national market.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in looking at this broad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of California will enforce its law? I mean, if it turns out that it isn't and that marijuana is getting in the interstate market, that might be a different thing.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4137 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, on this record, I don't think that there's any reason to assume that California is going to have some sort of almost unnatural ability to keep one part of a fungible national drug market separate. And I think Congress, here, made important findings that you've alluded to, not just that there's a national market, not just that the intrastate and the interstate markets are linked, but that drugs are fungible, and that because drugs are fungible, it's simply not feasible, in Congress' words, to regulate and separately focus on only drugs that have traveled on interstate commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4138 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, General Clement, what if we were to assume -- I'm not saying this is -- that the District Court could find that there is a narrow segment of the market in which they could prevent diversions, and they had -- say they made such findings. Would we have to disregard them, or say they were irrelevant?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think you would say they were irrelevant, Justice Stevens, and that's because --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But then why do you need to rely on the possibility of diversion?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, because I think it is a reality, in responding to Justice O'Connor's question -- I think that in -- obviously, in all of these commerce --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yeah, but in my hypothesis, it's a nonexistent reality.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in your hypothetical -- and if I could turn to that -- I still think the analysis would not turn on whether or not the truth of the supposition that diversion could be prevented, because this Court, in a series of cases, including Darby, Wickard, Wirtz, and Perez, has made clear that the relevant focal point for analysis is not the individual plaintiff's activities and whether they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but whether the class of activities that Congress has decided to regulate has such a substantial effect. And, in this case, there's no question that the overall production, distribution, and possession of marijuana and other Schedule I substances has a profound effect on interstate commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4144 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's not an interstate commerce that you want to foster. I mean, in these other -- in these other cases, Congress presumably wanted to foster interstate commerce in wheat, in Wickard v. Filburn. Congress doesn't want interstate commerce in marijuana. And it seems rather ironic to appeal to the fact that home-grown marijuana would reduce the interstate commerce that you don't want to occur in order to regulate it. I mean, you know, doesn't that strike you as strange?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4145 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, no, it doesn't, Justice Scalia, but let me respond in two ways. First of all, I think it's been clear, at least since the lottery case, that Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce includes the authority to prohibit items traveling in interstate commerce and to declare something contraband in interstate commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I would suggest that it is a perfectly rational exercise of Congress' judgement to treat marijuana and other Schedule I substances not just as contraband in interstate commerce, but as contraband simpliciter, as contraband for all purposes.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's quite a different rational than from Wickard v. Filburn. I mean, it seems to me you're not -- you're not appealing to the fact that it has a substantial impact on interstate commerce. You're appealing to the fact that the power which Congress has to prohibit the use of goods carried in interstate commerce cannot effectively be implemented without this law.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think there's some truth to that, Justice Scalia, but let me say this. I think what I'm saying is, I'm taking the rational that this Court accepted in Wickard, and I'm applying it to a different regulatory regime. Here, Congress --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you're applying it to the opposite kind of regulatory -- you're applying it to a regulatory regime in which the government wants to prohibit this subject -- substance from being sold or -- in interstate commerce. And if you just follow the litter -- letter of this law, this marijuana won't get into interstate commerce. In fact, it would reduce the demand for marijuana, because it would supply these local users and they wouldn't have to go into the interstate market.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, if you took a look at the Controlled Substances Act, itself, and read it literally, you'd assume that there was absolutely no market, period, in Schedule I substances. But the reality is, there's a $10.5 billion market -- illegal market, albeit -- but market in marijuana in the United States, on an annual basis. So --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But to the extent that this statute has any impact, it will reduce the purchase in the interstate market and confine these to locally grown marijuana.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, first of all, Justice Stevens, that's only true if there will be no diversion, to get back to --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then I'm assuming -- my hypothetical is that California could pass a law that would prevent diversions from occurring.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in the same way that the Federal Government has had trouble stamping out the marijuana market entirely, I think California is going to have parallel problems in absolutely preventing diversion.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But just --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I suppose some -- one answer to that case is the Perez case, with loan sharking.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, absolutely, Justice Kennedy. And, in that context, what this Court said is, even though it was focused on what was going to be an -- both in that case and generally, an interstate activity, Congress did not have to just look at the particular plaintiff's effect on interstate commerce, but, rather, the effect of the entire class of activities. And if I could --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, as Justice O'Connor brought out earlier, all those cases -- Wickard, Perez -- they all involve a commercial enterprise. And, here, we're told this is different, because nobody is buying anything, nobody is selling anything.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think the whole point of the Wickard case was to extend rationales that it applied previously to commerce to activity that the Court described as economic, but not commercial. And I think the production and distribution and possession of marijuana is economic in the same way that the production of wheat was in the Wickard case.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you're -- no, I was going to -- your whole point, I take it, is that the two particular patients in this case are simply -- simply cannot be taken, for our purposes, as representative in the fact that they are getting the marijuana by, I think, growing it themselves or being given it. You're saying, you cannot take that fact as a fact from which to generalize in deciding this case.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly right, Justice Souter, and that is the logic, not just of me, but of this Court's cases, in cases like Darby and Wickard and Wirtz and Perez. And I point to the Wickard case, in particular, only because it, too, involves a non-commercial enterprise or a non-commercial production of --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I do take issue with that. As I read the record in Wickard, it involved a small farmer. A portion of his wheat went on the interstate market. It also was fed to cattle, which, in turn, went on the interstate market. He used some of it himself, but part of it was commercial. I think Wickard can be distinguished on the facts.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice O'Connor, it could be -- I mean, any case can be distinguished on the facts, of course, but I think what's important is, this Court, in Wickard, itself, recognized that the case was -- it was only interesting because a portion of the regulated wheat involved wheat that was going to be consumed on the farm. And --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The other portion is a matter of [inaudible] interstate commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's true, Justice O'Connor, but this Court, basically, in its opinion, Justice Jackson, for the Court, put aside -- to one side all of the grain that was going to go in interstate commerce, since that's easy under our existing precedents. This case is only interesting, he said, because it involves wheat that's going to be consumed on the farm. And he specifically talked about both the wheat that would be fed to the animals, but also the wheat that would be consumed by the family. And what he said is, the intended disposition of the particular wheat wasn't clear from the record of the case. And, by that, I take him to mean that it wasn't relevant to the Court's analysis in upholding the Agricultural Adjustment Act to the wheat at issue there. And it's important to recognize that the way the Agricultural Adjustment Act worked is, it applied to all the wheat that was grown in excess of the quota, and so it applied to the wheat that was used by the family for consumption of their own bread. And, nonetheless, this Court upheld that as a valid Commerce Clause regulation. And so I think, by parity of reasoning, all of the marijuana that's at issue and covered by the Controlled Substances Act, whether it's lawful under state law, whether it's involved in a market transaction or not, is fairly within the Congress' Commerce Clause --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And is --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- authority.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- this a harder or easier case than Wickard when we know that, in Wickard, it was lawful to buy and sell wheat, and, here, it is unlawful to buy and sell marijuana?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Kennedy --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does this make your case easier, in a sense, or --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it does, Justice Kennedy, because, as I said earlier, in responding to a question from Justice Scalia, I think if you're talking about a context where Congress has the undoubted power to prohibit something in interstate commerce entirely, and has exercised that power, so it treats something as effectively contraband in interstate commerce, and then takes the complementary step, especially in light of the fungibility of the product, and says, "We're just going to treat this as contraband simpliciter." I think that judgement by Congress has a very definite link to interstate commerce and its unquestioned authority to regulate interstate commerce. And I do think there's a sense in which when Congress is regulating the price of something, there's certainly a temptation to excise out relatively small producers and for Congress to say, "Well, we can still have effective regulation if we regulate the vast majority of production." But with respect to something that's unlawful to have and is -- and has very significant risks precisely because it's unlawful, any little island of lawful possession of non-contraband marijuana, for example, poses a real challenge to the statutory regime. It would also, I think, frustrate Congress' goal in promoting health. And I think the clearest example of that is the fact that, to the extent there is anything beneficial, health-wise, in marijuana, it's THC, which has been isolated and provided in a pill form, and has been available as a Schedule III substance, called --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there's --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- Marinol.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- but there is, in this record, a showing that, for at least one of the two plaintiffs, there were some 30-odd drugs taken, none of them worked. This was the only one that would. And it -- Justice Souter asked you about these two plaintiffs. The law can't be made on the basis of those two plaintiffs. But let's suppose that you're right, generally. If there were to be a prosecution of any of the plaintiffs in this case, would there be any defense, if there were to be a federal prosecution?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we would take the position, based on our reading of the Oakland Cannabis case -- and, obviously, different justices on this Court read the opinion differently and had different views on the extent to which the medical-necessity defense was foreclosed by that opinion -- I would imagine the Federal Government, in that case, if it took the unlikely step of bringing the prosecution in the first place, would be arguing that, on the authority of Oakland Cannabis, the medical-necessity defense was not available. But I think, in any event, what is important, at this point, is that we don't have a prosecution; we have an affirmative effort to strike down the Controlled Substances Act in an injunctive action. And I think, in that context, certainly Justice Souter is right, that this Court's precedents make clear that one doesn't consider only the individual's conduct, but the entire class of activities that's at issue. I think, in this regard, it's also worth emphasizing that a deeper flaw in the Respondent's argument, that California law is somehow relevant here or the fact that their conduct is lawful under California law, is that there's a mismatch between what California law makes lawful and what might be considered relevant for arguing that there's an attenuated effect on interstate commerce. Because the California law makes the possession of marijuana for medical use lawful under state law, without regard to whether that marijuana has been involved in a cash transaction or has crossed state lines. And so, if Respondents are right on their Commerce Clause theory, I don't see how they can be right because their conduct is lawful under state law or because their -- that marijuana use is medical. If they're right, then I think their analysis would extend to recreational use of marijuana, as well as medical use of marijuana, and would extend to every state in the nation, not just --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- those states that made it lawful.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Doesn't it depend on how you define the "relevant class of activities"? Is it the entire class that Congress ought to regulate, or is it a narrower class, in which the Plaintiffs contend that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to a particular very narrowly defined class? And is it ever permissible to define the class narrowly to escape a -- the broad argument that you make?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't think that is permissible, Justice Stevens. I think that's what this Court's cases in Wirtz, in Darby, in Wickard --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you're saying that this statute could never have an unconstitutional application.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under the Commerce Clause, I -- that's exactly right, that would be our position. It is constitutional on its face, and it -- and because of that line of authority, an as-applied challenge can be brought, but the legal test that's applied in the as-applied challenge is one that considers the constitutionality of the statute as a whole --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, in Morrison, did the Court's opinion not say that Congress cannot justify Commerce Cause -- Clause legislation by using a long but- for causal chain from the activity in question to an impact on interstate commerce? I mean, the Court certainly made that statement.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, absolutely, Justice O'Connor, but --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which cuts against what you're saying.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, with respect, I don't think so. And I'd say two things about it. One, this Court, in Morrison and Lopez, was very important to emphasize -- thought it very important to emphasize two things: one, that the activity there was non-economic in a way that differentiated it, even from Wickard; and, second, the Court also made it clear that the regulation that there -- there was not essential to the effectiveness of an overall regulatory scheme. And I think, on both points, this case is on the constitutional side of the line that separates the Lopez and the Morrison case.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The argument on the other side is that this limited exception is a non-economic use -- growing for personal use, under prescription --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand that -- I understand that's their argument, Justice O'Connor, but I don't understand how this Court, in Lopez, could have said that Wickard involved non-economic activity if this activity is not also covered. You're talking about --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Involved economic activity.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry if I misspoke. Economic activity. Because what you're talking about here is the possession, the manufacture, the distribution of a valuable commodity for which there is a ready -- unfortunately, a ready market, albeit an illicit market.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If we rule for the Respondents in this case, do you think the street price of marijuana would go up or down in California?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would be speculating, Justice Kennedy, but I think the price would go down. And I think that what -- and that, in a sense, is consistent with the government's position, which is to say, when the government thinks that something is dangerous, it tries to prohibit it. Part of the effort of prohibiting it is going to lead to a black market, where the prohibition actually would force the price up. And there is a sense in which this regulation, although not primarily designed as a price regulation -- the Controlled Substance Act, I think, does have the effect of increasing the price for marijuana in a way that stamps down demand and limits the -- and in a way that reduces demand. And I think that's all consistent with Congress' judgement here. And if I could return for a second to the point about Marinol, what's important there is that the process of manufacturing of Marinol, and isolating the one helpful component, does two things. One, the manufacturing process allows there to be a safe use for one of the components in marijuana. But it also provides an unambiguous hook for Congress to exercise its Commerce Clause authority. And yet the overall regime of trying to get people to use more healthful substances, and not use things like crude marijuana that have harmful effects, is undermined if Congress can't also address that which is more harmful, but is distinct only because it is capable of being locally produced. And that's exactly what crude marijuana is.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In other words, the statute is -- it trumps the independent judgement of the physicians who prescribe it for the patients at issue in this case.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think, in responding to that, Justice Stevens, I would say, obviously, for purposes of federal law, the idea of medical marijuana is something of an oxymoron, because the Federal Government treats it as a Schedule I substance. Now, notwithstanding that, some doctors may make a different judgement about a particular patient; but that's something that this Court, I think, has previously understood, that the federal regulatory regime does not allow individual patients or doctors to exempt themselves out of that regime.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that's the import of the Rutherford decision with Laetrile.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think there could be any state of facts on which a judicial tribunal could disagree with the finding of Congress that there's no acceptable medical use? Say they had a -- say there was a judicial hearing on which they made a contrary finding. Would we have to ignore that? Would we have to follow the congressional finding or the judicial finding if that happened?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it depends on the exact hypothetical you have in mind. I think the -- the judicial finding that I think would be appropriate, and this Court would not have to ignore in any way, is a finding by the D.C. Circuit that, in a particular case where there's a rescheduling effort before the FDA, that the underlying judgement of the FDA refusing to reschedule is invalid, arbitrary, capricious. That's the way to go after the finding that marijuana is a Schedule I substance without a valid medical use in treatment. This is not a situation in -- and your hypothetical might respond to a different statute that raised a harder question, where Congress made such a medical finding, and then just left it there without any mechanism to adjust the finding for changing realities. But, here, Congress made it clear that a process remains open to reschedule marijuana in a way that gets it onto Schedule II or Schedule III. And I think it's wrong to assume that there's any inherent hostility to the substances at issue here. I mean, the FDA, for example, rescheduled Marinol from Schedule II to Schedule III in a way that had the effect of making it easier to prescribe and more available. But I think what's going on with the FDA is an effort to try to counterbalance the risk for abuse, the risk for diversion, with these other considerations of getting safe medicine --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Have there --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- available to patients --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- have there been any applications to change the schedule for marijuana to the FDA?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There have been a number of those petitions that have been filed. There was one recently rejected, I think as recently as 2001; it may be 1999. There was also a series of, kind of, a four- or five-iteration effort to change the rescheduling that culminated in a D.C. Circuit opinion in the early '90s. So there's definitely been these efforts. But on the current state of the -- of the record, there just is not a justification for changing the schedule. And I think both of the briefs talked a little bit about the Institute of Medicine's study about the medical efficacy of marijuana. And I think one thing that's important to keep in mind that that study comes to a conclusion about is, whatever benefits there may be for the individual components in marijuana, that smoked -- smoked marijuana itself really doesn't have any future as medicine, because -- and that's true, I think, for two reasons. One, there's something like 400 different chemical components in crude marijuana that one would smoke, and it's -- it just, sort of, belies any logic that all 400 of those would be helpful. And a big part of the process of medicine, generally, is to take raw, crude material that somebody could grow in their garden, and actually have people who do this for a living get involved in a process of synthesizing and isolating the beneficial components, and then manufacturing and making that available. The second reason that smoked marijuana doesn't have much of a future as medicine is, as I think people understand, smoking is harmful; and that's true of tobacco, but it's also true of marijuana. And so the idea that smoked marijuana would be an effective delivery device for medicine, I think, is also something that really doesn't have any future as medicine. What does have a future for medicine, of course, is an effort to synthesize and isolate the beneficial component. That's been done with Marinol. It is true that some people have difficulty tolerating the pill form that Marinol is available in. And there's ongoing research to try to figure out different ways to deliver that substance. But there is, in a sense, a little bit of a -- and the Institute of Medicine's study has about five pages discussing Marinol, and it makes the point that there's something of a tradeoff. Because one of the downsides of Marinol, as opposed to marijuana, is that it takes longer to get into the bloodstream. But that's also one of the reasons why the FDA has made a judgement that Marinol is less subject to abuse, because it takes longer to get into the drug-stream, and so it doesn't have the characteristic of street drugs that tend to be abused, which is a very quick delivery time between the taking of the substance and the time that it has an effect on the system.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I go back to your point a few minutes ago about -- it was, sort of, a categoric point -- you, in effect, said, "If this argument succeeds with respect to medical use of marijuana, the next argument is going to be recreational use, and there's no real way to distinguish between them." Wouldn't this be a way to distinguish between them? That in deciding what class you are going to -- or what subclass you're going to consider from which to generalize, you simply ask the question, "What good reasons are there to define a subclass this way?" In this particular case, the good reasons to define a subclass of medical usage are the benefits -- whether you accept the evidence is another thing -- but the benefits which the doctors say that, under present circumstances, you can get from smoking it, as opposed to taking the synthesized drug. There's no such argument, I would guess, in favor of recreational marijuana usage as a separate category. And, for that reason, isn't there a -- isn't there a good reason to categorize this as narrowly as the Respondents are doing here, just medical usage, without any risk of generalizing to recreational usage?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think that it would be a good idea for this Court to get on a path of starting to second-guess Congress' judgement about defining a class of activities --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That may -- oh, that may be, but it seems to me that that's a separate argument, because you're -- you were arguing before that if you recognize medical usage, you don't have any way of drawing the line against private recreational usage. And I'm suggesting that you do have a reason for drawing that line, and it's the benefit for medical usage, if you accept the evidence; whereas, there is no reason to categorize recreational usage separately, and that seems to me a category argument, rather than a respect-for-Congress argument.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Souter, I have no doubt that this Court could draw a line. I think it would find it very difficult to police that line over the broad variety of cases. I think it would find it every bit as frustrating as policing the line in Hammer against Dagenhart that this Court abandoned in Darby. With that, I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Barnett.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4209 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I have two points to make. First, the class of activities involved in this case are non-economic and wholly intrastate. Second, the federal prohibition of this class of activities it not essential -- is not an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. If you accept the government's contrary contentions on either of these two points, Ashcroft v. Raich will replace Wickard v. Filburn as the most far-reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, on your first point, can't we infer from the fact that there's an enormous market, commercial market, for any given commodity, that simple possession of that commodity is a form of participation in the market?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It can be, or it might not be. If you possess an item that came from the market or is going to the market, simple possession could easily be a part of the marketplace. But if you're in possession of an item that you've made, yourself, that is disconnected from the market -- it didn't come from the market and it's not going to the market --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but it's fungible.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- the fungibility issue is in this case, but the -- but a -- the fact that a good is fungible does not make it a market good, and it does not make the possession of that good an economic activity. Or --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you know, Congress has applied this theory in other contexts. One is the protection of endangered species. Congress has made it unlawful to possess ivory, for example. It doesn't matter whether you got it lawfully, or not; or eagle feathers, the mere possession of it, whether you got it through interstate commerce or not. And Congress' reasoning is, "We can't tell whether it came through interstate commerce or not, and to try to prove that is just beyond our ability; and, therefore, it is unlawful to possess it, period." Now, are those -- are those laws, likewise, unconstitutional, as going beyond Congress' commerce power?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not if they're an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut, unless those activities are reached.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, why is that different from this?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because this class of activities -- because it's been isolated by the State of California, and is policed by the State of California, so that it's entirely separated from the market --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isolated and -- I understand that there are some communes that grow marijuana for the medical use of all of the members of the communes.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That class of activities is not before the Court. That is actually before --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but it's before the Court when you -- when you raise the policing of the problem by California, and saying it's not a -- it's not a real problem, you brought it before the Court.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that class of activities could be -- could be -- if this Court limits its ruling to the class of activities that is before the Court, that class --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which is -- which is what?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which is --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ An individual grower?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ An individual who is growing it for her -- him- or herself, who has -- or has a caregiver growing it for her --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Gee, what basis --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- for --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- what basis is there to draw it that narrowly? I mean, I guess if we -- we could say people whose last name begins with a Z. You know, that would narrow the category, too. But why does -- why does that make any sense?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, we believe it makes sense because we are talking about a classification of activities that has been identified by the State of California, and which is rational to distinguish from --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, but California hasn't identified individual growers. Communes are okay, as far as California law is concerned.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's not entirely clear whether communes are okay, as far as the California laws are concerned.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why wouldn't it be?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because if, in fact, commercial activity is taking place, if buying and selling is taking place --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, they're not buying and selling. I mean, you can't prove they're buying and selling. There are just a whole lot of people there, with alleged medical needs.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, I don't understand. Is there any authority in the commerce cases for -- an X, which is there in the middle of a state, and it doesn't move one way or the other -- now, Congress' power does extend to the X if the state doesn't say something about the X. But if the state says something about the X, then Congress' power does not extend to it. That's hard for me to accept, because I don't see -- whether it's commerce or not commerce, whether it affects something or doesn't affect something, doesn't seem to me to have much to do with whether the state separately regulates it, and I can't find any support at all for that in any case.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The support would come from the exception to Lopez and Morrison that the government is urging that the Court adopt, that the Congress can reach non-economic activity that's intrastate, that's wholly intrastate, if doing so is essential to a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut if they can't reach it.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, here, they say -- look, I take it you're using this because I was going to ask you. You know, he grows heroin, cocaine, tomatoes that are going to have genomes in them that could, at some point, lead to tomato children that will eventually affect Boston. You know, we can -- oil that's never, in fact, being used, but we want an inventory of it, federally. You know, I can multiply the examples --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and you can, too. So you're going to get around all those examples by saying what?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ By saying that it's all going to depend on the regulatory scheme, what the --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- purpose of the --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So now what you're saying is, in a Commerce Clause case, what we're supposed to do is to start to look at the federal scheme and the state scheme and see, comparing the federal scheme and the state scheme, whether, given the state scheme, the federal scheme is really necessary to include this. That's a task, and I'm trying to make it as complicated as I can in my question. [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I see it very well. Here is what they say. They say that, "By the way, a hundred-thousand people using medical marijuana in California will lead to lower marijuana prices in the nation. Bad. And, second, when we see medical marijuana in California, we won't know what it is. Everybody'll say, 'Mine is medical.' Certificates will circulate on the black market. We face a mess. For both those reasons, it does have an impact," they say. Now, what's your response?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you've raised at least two different practical issues. One is the fact -- the number of people who are in the class, and the second is the ability to identify whether they properly belong in the class. As for the number of people, we are talking about a very small number of people. They say a hundred-thousand. They get their figures from the National Organization from Reform of Marijuana Laws. Our figures in our brief come from the government. The figures show it's a very small fraction of persons that would be involved. And their argument is basically -- and the logic of your hypothetical is premised on -- the more people that go into the illicit market, the better for federal drug policy, because that will drive the price up. You have to -- what we're take -- we're doing is, we're taking people out of the illicit drug market, which then, under your hypothetical, would lead to a reduction -- and Justice Kennedy's suggestion -- would lead to a reduction in the price of the illegal market, which, the opposite would be, they're -- it's good for federal policy to have more people in the illicit drug market, because that's going to drive the price up.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, we don't want more people --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course not.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- in the illicit drug market. [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course not.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And we don't want low prices, either. [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the -- but the -- but the scheme of -- but the class of activities that have been authorized by the State of California will take people out of --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So, normally I would have said, it's up to Congress to figure out how to -- the way that -- you have one going one way, one going the other way, and balancing those factors would be for Congress. That's what we'd normally say.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you say all that stuff is not for Congress; that's for us.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, within this exception -- the threshold issue -- I do want to make sure that I focus on this -- the threshold issue, which is the issue that has occupied most of our time so far, is whether the activity here is economic or non-economic. The government claims it's economic, we claim it's non-economic.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what it is, is, it's non-economic, and it affects the economic.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. So the threshold issue that is -- that -- upon which Lopez and Morrison terms -- turns is whether it's economic or non-economic.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I should have thought that regular household chores of -- say, performed in an earlier time mostly by women, was classically economic -- washing dishes, making bread. And now you say growing marijuana isn't?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you accept the government's definition of economic, then every -- then washing dishes, today, would be economic, and that --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but even --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- would be within the -- within the power of Congress to reach.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But even if we accept your definition of economic, I don't see that it is a basis upon which we ought to make a category decision. You say it's non-economic because one of these people is a -- is a self-grower, another one is getting it from a friend for nothing. But I don't see what reason that you have given, or any reason that you haven't given, for us to believe that, out of -- now I'm going to assume, for the sake of argument, a hundred-thousand potential users -- everybody is going to get it from a friend or from plants in the backyard. Seems to me the sensible assumption is, they're going to get it on the street. And once they get it, under California law, it's not a crime for them to have it and use it. But they're going to get it in the street. Why isn't that the sensible assumption?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they have an -- they have a very strong incentive not to get it on the street, because getting it on the street is going to subject them to criminal prosecution, under both California and federal law, as well as the --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah, but the -- it's also the case that approximately 10 percent of the American population is doing that every day, if I accept the figures in the government's brief, and they're not getting prosecuted.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But we're talking -- in that case, we're talking about people who are using it for sport, for recreation. We are talking about a class of people here who are sick people, who don't necessarily want to violate the law.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if I am a sick person, I'm going to say, "Look, if they're not prosecuting every kid who buys, what, a nickel bag or whatever you call a small quantity today, they're not going to prosecute me, either." I mean, there's not going to be any incentive, it seems to me, to avoid the street market.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The government, in their brief, asserts that the -- that the possession statute that currently exists provides a deterrent effect, which is why they -- which is their explanation for why they failed to enforce the possession statute that they say is so essential to the --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If one --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- regulatory scheme.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- if one takes your view, that this is non-economic activity, so it's outside Congress' commerce power, then explain to me why, if you have someone similarly situated in a neighboring state, somebody whose doctor says, "This person needs marijuana to live," but that state doesn't have a Compassionate-Use Act -- it's just as isolated -- no purchase, no sale, grown at home, good friend grows it -- and yet you say Congress could regulate that, if I understand your brief properly.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor, because there's the -- that's the second step of the analysis. The first step of the analysis is the economic/non-economic. If you don't -- if the Court stops there, then they could also apply in these other states. But then if the Court adopts --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if you -- if you buy that -- so your first answer is, yes, on your first argument, it would be equally impermissible for the feds to regulate medical use anywhere.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. Now you're going to have some limiting --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But a limiting principle is the one that I -- was identified by the Court in Lopez in which the government is asserting that if it's an essential part of a broader regulation of economic activity to reach this activity, then it may be reached. And the difference between states in which there is a state law enforcement that's confining the class, and that there is a discrimination between legal and non-legal use, is completely different from a practical enforcement standpoint than a state in which there is no differentiation. Just think of the existence, for example, of identification cards, which the State of California is going to be issuing, like driver's license cards.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah, but it doesn't right now, and that doesn't make the scheme less valid, in your view.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, because -- but this is the sort of regulation -- the sort of effectiveness of the regulation that will be at issue and which is, in fact -- I believe the Court should be in the position of trusting the State of California to be able to administer its regime. There is no regime in other states to trust, and, therefore, the argument that it is necessary to reach that activity, and a lot of other activity in states in which the states are not attempting to pursue the health of their citizens -- the goal of preserving the health of their citizens this way, that would fall under the exception which this Court suggested in Lopez --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is a new framework, I take it, and it's very interesting. And one of the things that interests me -- I guess, on your framework, Lopez should have come out my way. [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's essential to regulate guns in schools as part of a national gun-control regulatory scheme.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, that's the reason why that exception has to be narrowly treated, so it doesn't reach your result. [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that exception were treated as broadly as you suggested that it should be in your dissent in Morrison, then the game is up, the exception will swallow the rule, and Lopez and Morrison will be limited to their facts.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought we didn't need to reach all that here, for the reason that the connection here, which is an enforcement-related connection and a market-related connection, is actually, I have to confess, a little more obvious and a little more close than what I had to -- what I had to say in Lopez to -- was the connection between guns, education, communities, and business. So I would have thought, given the -- and I believe that, you know -- but, I mean -- but that was far further than this, which is just direct.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But this case is completely unlike those cases. This case is completely isolated. In Lopez, that gun probably did come through interstate commerce, not that I believe it should have made any difference, but it probably did. Here, we're talking about substances that don't. So there's just no literal connection between this class of activities and this interstate market.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we didn't decide that, in Lopez, on the basis of whether the gun had come in interstate commerce. If the statute in question had applied only to guns that had been transported in interstate commerce, the case might have come out differently.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- no doubt, Your -- I -- and I wasn't suggesting otherwise, Justice Scalia. I'm just suggesting that, here, we have -- exactly, that if there had been that interstate connection in Lopez, the case might have come out different. There is no interstate connection whatsoever in this class of cases. None. The only way to make it an interstate connection is through some sort of hypothetical economic substitution effect in which somebody who's doing something over here is going to have an affect on somebody else who's doing something over there. There is no connection.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sounds like Wickard to me.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Wickard, Your Honor --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I always used to laugh at Wickard, but that's -- that's what Wickard said.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Wickard --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Had he not eaten the wheat, it would have been in interstate commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Had that case been about eating wheat, that case would never have arisen.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's what it was about, as far as the Court's analysis was concerned. To be sure, there were a lot of -- there was a lot more use of the wheat on his farm, other than just human consumption, but it seems to me the analysis of the case said, "You take it -- you take it out of the stream of commerce by growing it yourself, you make it unnecessary for your -- to buy it in interstate commerce."
03-1454 +++$+++ 4294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's -- the entire analysis -- the entire proof that the court relied upon in Wickard was proof of the economic impact of home-consumed wheat on the farms. And by "home-consumed," it did not mean eating at the family -- at the family table; it meant feeding to your livestock and then putting it -- your livestock --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Strange phrase, to mean "feeding to livestock"?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ "Home-consumed" is feed it to your pig?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, yes, that's exactly what --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4300 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that's exactly what that general term -- how that general term was used in this case.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4301 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what the Court said, I take it -- and I have quoted a lot of the language there -- it says that the wheat farmer's consumption of home-grown wheat, not the part that went in -- quote, "though it may not be regarded as commerce" --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- end quote, still can be regulated, quote, "whatever its nature," so long as, quote, "it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce." Now, that's the language, and I take it that Justice Scalia is exactly right, I thought, from that language, it's about the analysis, home-grown wheat, which is not economic, having an effect on something that is.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With all respect --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which is not commerce. Sorry, not commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With all respect, what -- that's -- I was about to make that --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the Commerce Clause speaks in terms of commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. Right. What the Court was using here was the narrower -- the traditional definition of "commerce" that Justice Thomas has been urging this Court to adopt. And they were saying that, "We are not going to limit ourselves to that narrow definition of 'commerce.'" It would include, for example, agriculture and production. That's all going to be reachable, even though it's not commerce, in the traditional sense. But what we would call it today, and I believe what the Court correctly called it, in Lopez, was "economic activity." Production is economic activity. Manufacturing is economic activity. But -- it's not commerce, but it's economic activity that can be reached. And that is the activity -- that's not only the activity that Farmer Filburn was engaged in; that was the activity that the statute was aimed at. The statute --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, why is this not economic activity, if you use the term in that broad sense? This marijuana that is grown, just like the wheat that was grown, in Wickard, since it's grown on the farm, doesn't have to be bought elsewhere, and that makes it an economic activity.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What made it an economic activity in Wickard was the fact that it was part of commercial enterprise, that it was being used on the farm -- not in interstate commerce, but part of the commercial enterprise of the farm.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Again, I don't think that's -- that faithfully represents what the opinion said. I think the opinion covered -- including the amount that he consumed himself, and his family consumed.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- look, I -- for whatever it's worth, it's worth remembering that the statute exempted small commercial farms. People who had backyard gardens weren't even included within the regulatory regime. The regulatory regime was about regulating or stopping or restricting the supply of wheat that got into the market, or that could have --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did the opinion make a point of that?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Pardon me?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did the opinion make a point of that?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it was mentioned in the opinion. It was not -- it was not a major point of this opinion. But --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think it was a point of the Court's analysis at all.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could I -- could I --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could I ask this question. What is your view with respect to the impact of the activities concerned in this case on the interstate market for marijuana? Is it your view that it will have no impact, that it will increase the interstate demand, or decrease the interstate demand? So there are three alternatives. Which is the one we should follow?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I pick "trivial impact"? [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but if it -- "trivial impact," is it a trivial impact that enhances the price of marijuana or decreases the price of marijuana, in your view?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The only effect it could have on the price would be a slight trivial reduction, if it has any effect at all, because it's going to withdraw users from the illicit drug market. And to the extent that they are now in the illicit drug market -- and we don't know whether they are or not --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that would reduce demand and increase price, it seems to me. It's the other way around.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it would reduce demand and reduce prices, I think. But --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you reduce demand, you reduce prices? Are you sure?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, you're right. You're right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your whole argument for triviality, though, goes -- your whole argument for triviality, though, goes back to your disagreement with the government about how many people are involved, because I take it you accept the assumption that the more people who are involved -- if there are millions and millions, it is unlikely that this licensed activity is going to be without an effect on the market. So the whole argument boils down to how many people are going to be involved. You don't accept the government's 100,000-dollar figure. Let me ask you a question that would -- that would get to, maybe, a different number, and that is, do you know how many people there are in California who are undergoing chemotherapy at any given time?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I do not know the answer to that.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't that number going to be indicative of the demand for marijuana?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It could be, Your Honor, but that also illustrates --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if you -- if you accept that, then there's nothing implausible about the government's hundred-thousand number, is there?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But whatever -- I don't know, because I don't know the number of people using chemotherapy. But whatever the number --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How many people are there in California? What's the population?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thirty-four million.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4337 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Kennedy.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4338 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Lots -- lots -- [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- lots and lots. They -- a hundred-thousand cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy does not seem like an implausible number. And, in fact, if that number is a plausible one today, its plausibility reflects, among other things, the fact that there is a controversy as to whether California's law, in fact, is enforceable, or not. And the reason -- there is reason to assume that -- if we ruled your way, that that number would go up. So, if you accept that line of argument, then your argument, that the effect, whatever it may be, is going to be trivial, seems to me unsupportable. Am I missing something?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, two things. First of all, whatever number it is, it's going to be confined to people who are sick, who are sick enough to use this. That is not an infinitely expandable number, the way, for example, recreational activity is, where lots of people could just decide to do it. We're talking about people who qualify, on a physician's recommendation, for this particular activity. That will limit the number. But the amount of the people -- the effect on commerce only matters if the Wickard v. Filburn aggregation principle applies to the class of activities in this case, and it does not apply to the class of activities in this case if they are non-economic, as we assert that they are.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well -- but that is circular reasoning, because the whole -- your whole argument that it's non-economic is based on the claim that there are -- the numbers are so few -- the number of people involved, from what you could generalize, are so few that it would not be reasonable to infer an effect on the market. If there would be a large market effect, it makes no more sense to call this non-economic than Filburn's use, non-economic.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4342 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Lopez and Morrison stand for the proposition that activities that simply have an effect on the market are not necessary -- that does not make them economic. This Court rejected that proposition, that just because an activity has an effect -- an economic effect makes the activity, itself, economic. It adopted a principle that's less than --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4343 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Remote, remote, remote economic effect.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4344 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was inference upon inference upon inference. That's not what we're talking about here.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4345 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But just -- just have it -- just -- whether an activity is economic, you have to look to the activity, itself, and an economic activity is one that's associated with sale, exchange, barter, the production of things for sale and exchange, barter. This whole Court's jurisprudence since The New Deal has been premised on the ability to tell the difference between economic activity, on the one hand, and personal liberty, on the other.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But your whole jurisprudence in this case is premised on the assumption that we have got to identify the entire range of potential effect based on the particular character of two individuals in their -- in their supply of marijuana. And the whole point of this argument is that that does not seem to be a realistic premise on which to base constitutional law.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The premise of our -- the premise of our economic claim is the nature of the activity involved, not necessarily its effect, but the kind of activity it is. The idea -- for example, you -- prostitution is an economic activity. Marital relations is not an economic activity. We could be talking about virtually the same act. And there is a market overhang for -- from private sexual relations to prostitution, but we don't say that because there is a market for prostitution, that, therefore, everything that is not in that market is economic. We look at the activities, and we --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'd like to ask you one question about the activity --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- which was brought up before, and I just -- I've never understood this. I'm not an expert. I don't honestly know, if I really think about it, despite all the papers and so forth, whether it's true that medical marijuana is helpful to people in ways that pills are not. I really don't know. So I would have thought that the people, like your clients, who have a strong view about it, would go to the FDA, and they would say to the FDA, "FDA, take this off the list. You must take it off the list if it has an accepted medical use and it isn't lacking in safety." The FDA will say yes or it will say no. If it says yes, they win. If they say no, they can come right into court and say, "That's an abuse of discretion." The Court says yes or no. If it says yes, they win. If it says no, it must be because it wasn't an abuse of discretion, in which case, I, as a judge, and probably as a person, would think it isn't true that marijuana has some kind of special use. So that would seem to me to be the obvious way to get what they want. That seems to me to be relevant to the correct characterization. And while the FDA can make mistakes, I guess medicine by regulation is better than medicine by referendum.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So that's -- I just want to know why.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, first of all, that whole process wouldn't dictate what the power of Congress is to reach this activity --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's all true, but as long as that hasn't been done, don't I have to take this case on the assumption that there is no such thing as medical marijuana that's special and necessary?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If has been done, maybe I shouldn't make it.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- I would simply ask Your Honor to read the amicus brief by Rick Doblin, in which it describes the government's obstruction of scientific research that would establish the safety and efficacy of cannabis by denying supplies of cannabis -- of medical -- of cannabis for medical experimentation. And then I'd ask Your Honor to read the Institute for Medicine's report, that both the government and I -- and we have relied upon in our briefs. There has been no impeachment of this report by the National Academy of Sciences on the medical effect. And what they say is that the -- that what information we have is that cannabis does have a substantial medical effect. Smoked cannabis does carry with it harms associated with it, as the -- as General Clement correctly pointed out. It does carry with it these ancillary harms. But when people are sick and people are suffering and people are dying, they may be willing to run the risk of these long-term harms in order to get the immediate relief, the life-saving relief that cannabis has demonstrably been able to provide. I'd just ask Your Honor to look at that, which is in the record.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are prescriptions, under California law, limited only to those people with life-threatening illnesses?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They are limited to a list of illnesses that are in the statute.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Some of the illnesses --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Some of which are life-threatening and some of which are not, Your Honor.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In one -- in one plaintiff's case, I think, there isn't a life-threatening --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor. She has -- she has severe back spasms and pain that cannot be controlled by conventional medicines. She's a law-abiding citizen. This goes back to the issue of what the -- incentives there are that are created by this. This is a law-abiding woman, who has never been interested in the illicit-drugs market.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I just ask you one procedural question?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And this is -- this is a suit for an injunction. And it -- basically an injunction against a criminal prosecution.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And seizure --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- of these plants.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and there's an old saying, in equity, that courts don't enjoin criminal prosecutions. So how is your injunction suit appropriate, given that old saying meant that you have to make your defense in the criminal proceeding and not enjoin this operation?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it is -- it is an -- we're seeking an injunction to prevent the enforcement of the statute against these two persons, which includes forfeiture, which has already happened in this case. We've already had Diane Monson's plants seized by the Drug Enforcement Authority. That is not something that we -- that we -- that has anything to do with criminal prosecution, and yet that puts at risk her supply of medicine, the supply of medicine she needs to get by, to relieve her suffering. I see my time is up. Thank you.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Barnett. General Clement, you have four minutes.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4380 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument now in No. 03-1488, Ulysses Tory v. Johnnie L. Cochran. Mr. Chemerinsky.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4382 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Good morning. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The injunction in this case violates the most basic principles of the First Amendment. It's a prior restraint. It's a content-based restriction on speech. It's vastly overbroad. It even restricts the speech of those who are not a party to the lawsuit, such as Petitioner Ruth Craft. The injunction in this case is inconsistent with this country's unique and profound commitment that speech by public officials and public figures be open, robust, and uninhibited. One way in which the injunction is clearly unconstitutional is in restricting the speech of those who are not a party to the lawsuit. For example, Ruth Craft is expressly restrained from ever speaking again about Johnnie Cochran even though she was never named as a party to the lawsuit. And, in fact, Cochran's attorney admitted at the beginning of trial, she wasn't a part of the lawsuit.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How about you? You're in trouble too, aren't you? (Laughter.)
03-1488 +++$+++ 4384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I am, Your Honor. This injunction is so broad that if I talk about Johnnie Cochran or this case on the sidewalk in front of this Court or pass out copies of the brief or speak to any reporter, I am violating the terms of the injunction and I could be held in contempt of court.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, you speak about the injunction, and the injunction has three parts. I thought that you were not challenging -- at least the question presented doesn't suggest you're challenging -- the first one that concerns distance, the 300 yard from Cochran or his place of business, and the third one, which is an anti-harassment provision. Do I understand correctly that it is only the second one that you're challenging?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. The question presented is that the injunction is unconstitutional. One of the reasons why the injunction is unconstitutional is that it's based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment. All of the statements that were uttered by Mr. Tory are opinion protected by the First Amendment. There is not the requisite actual malice. And so it's our position that the injunction itself is unconstitutional.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But your question is preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, and the first and third provisions of this injunction do not prohibit all future speech.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. It's our position, though, that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment, and we believe that the question presented is that the injunction is impermissible in its restriction of speech.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that isn't what you've said in the question presented. Why shouldn't we be limited to answering the question presented? And that would leave the other parts there.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, of course, you're limited to the question presented. Our position, though, is that the injunction in its restriction of speech is unconstitutional. And one of the reasons why the injunction is unconstitutional is that all of the speech that occurred in this case is speech that's protected by the First Amendment.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but you understand Justice Ginsburg's question surely, and I would imagine that even if you prevail, nothing we would order would affect the first and third parts.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, certainly we believe that the injunction is most clearly unconstitutional in its overbreadth. We believe also and separately the injunction is unconstitutional because injunctions are not a permissible remedy in a defamation case, especially concerning public officials and public figures. But it's also our position that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment, and thus, the injunction violates the First Amendment.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but that doesn't --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, is it true that your client intends to go on defaming Mr. Cochran?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4395 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. We don't believe our client has ever defamed Mr. Cochran. We believe that all of his speech is just opinion.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4396 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does he intend to continue making the same comments that he made before?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4397 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ His exact words were that perhaps he would continue to express his view that Mr. Cochran owes him money.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Now, let me ask you this. Under your theory, if -- if the defendant is judgment-proof, does respondent have any remedy at all if the statements are defamatory?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What is it?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is, of course, a remedy. Since we're dealing here with a public figure, there is the remedy of expressing views which this Court has said in Gertz v. Welch is available to a public figure. There is a damage judgment that's available. Certainly, Your Honor, there can't be a different rule --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if -- if the defendant is judgment-proof, what good does that do?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, there is a damage judgment that forever would be available against the person. And it cannot be, Your Honor, that those who are poor will have injunctions --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- well, your -- your answer should be to Justice O'Connor there is no effective legal remedy under your theory of the case.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, I disagree with that.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, you -- you say he has the remedy of -- of counter-speech. We're talking -- that's really that doesn't answer the question. The question is, is there anything he can get from the courts other than a damage remedy, and your answer I think is no.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor. From the courts, he can get a damage remedy but I don't accept that a damage remedy is inadequate just because a person may be poor. The damage remedy will be that they'd be collected for the person who gets assets in the future. Also, as I was saying to Justice O'Connor, it can't be --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- it seems to me that that really avoids the problem -- the problem. So suppose we disagree with you about that. Then it's true that there is no -- there is no legal remedy that he can get.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But then, Justice Kennedy, it can't be the rule that poor people have their speech enjoined, but those with assets can continue to speak in the future.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it also can't be the rule that poor people can defame ad libitum and -- and people who have money cannot. I mean, that's -- that's not a fair rule either.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, but that's why there would be, of course, the ability of a court to issue a damage judgment. There are many instances in which damage judgments can't be collected.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's worthless against a -- against a person who has no assets.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's true everywhere in the legal system, Your Honor. And I would also argue here that none of Mr. Tory's statements were defamatory. I would point --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now that's another one that is in your brief. You say that these were statements of opinion not fact. But that surely is not presented in your question. You -- you don't -- there were findings made that these statements were defamatory, and your question presented does not seem to me to encompass at all the question whether these statements were defamatory.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would disagree, Your Honor. The question presented is whether this injunction, that forever stops speech, violates the First Amendment. One reason why --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not -- not this injunction. The question presented is whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation -- in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment. There's no suggestion in that that you claim that in this particular case there was no defamation. I -- I just don't think it's fairly included within the question.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, what I am saying is that the question presented does ask whether this injunction, which permanently restricts speech --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, it doesn't. It says whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure violates the First Amendment.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We would argue --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's nothing about this particular injunction which is based upon speech that is not defamation. There's nothing in there about that.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, our position is that question asks whether an injunction violates the First Amendment, and certainly it is about this case. And our position is that all of the speech that was expressed in this case is opinion. And it's important --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Now, if that's so --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- well, there really -- there are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer is a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell us that that's not defamatory, I mean, I -- I think we should just proceed on -- on some other basis for this argument. We have other questions to discuss.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. But, Your Honor, I want to just respond to that. The exact statement there was -- and I'll quote it for you and it is on page 54 of the joint appendix. Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief. Can a lawyer go to heaven? Luke 11:46. Your Honor, this Court has said, for example, in Greenbelt Cooperative that charging somebody with blackmail is expressing opinion. In Letter Carriers v. Austin this Court said calling somebody a traitor is opinion.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. That -- that -- what you've quoted many -- much of this I wouldn't repeat in polite company. You've reported one of the most mild, and in fact there are two findings. One, this is not just defamation. It was an action for defamation, as well as a tort of invasion of privacy. And there is a finding, first, that this was done intentionally to create a negatively charged and ominous environment, and this is not a matter of speech-related issues. It is simply the use of false and defamatory and privacy-invading communications, or worse, or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for -- for desisting from that type of activity. All right. Now, those are the findings against you. So suppose I agreed with you hypothetically that that, with all these findings, is nonetheless protected by the First Amendment. All right? Now, suppose, in other words, you convince me of that. Now, I want to know how to write my opinion on that assumption to protect what I was worried about yesterday, that a woman who has a boyfriend or a husband is being continuously harassed in -- with methods similar to this one. See, it's easy to transpose those two cases which are both on my mind. And I want to know if in your opinion that these restraining orders, which try to prevent this kind of thing, among others, are unconstitutional, if there's a way of distinguishing them, if you could possibly win on what theory. And what I'm trying to get you to do is to say is it absolute. Are there limits? If so, what?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would suggest three different ways in which you could write the opinion that distinguished the case. The first is that this injunction is vastly overbroad, that even if there can be an injunction to say that Ulysses Tory and Ruth Craft can never again say anything about Johnnie Cochran in any public forum, that I can never speak about Johnnie Cochran would violate the First Amendment. A second way of distinguishing is that defamation is different, that when the First Amendment was adopted, the clear history was that above all it was to prevent prior restraints, and that injunctions were not permitted in defamation actions. That's quite different than a harassment action. And third, as I've argued, what makes this different is the basis for this injunction is speech protected by the First Amendment. With regard to the findings that you referred to, you mentioned two. The first is invasion of privacy. Your Honor, the only privacy claim in this case was false light invasion of privacy. California law is clear. When there is a defamation action and a false light claim, the false light claim is automatically dismissed as duplicative when it's based on the same fact. The second basis you pointed --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, this case comes up to us from a California appellate court. Surely they know California law better than we do.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, but they did not base their decision on the privacy claim because California law is clear that when it's false light invasion of privacy brought together with a defamation action, the false light claim is dismissed. That's a California case, Couch v. San Jose Unified School District.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we're not going to debate among ourselves over what California law is.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4430 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. All I'm saying is it's important to be clear about what the privacy claim is. As I was saying to Justice Breyer, there may be privacy claims that give rise to injunctions. Harassment claims may give rise to injunctions, but not the privacy claim in this case which was just about false light, which even the California Court of Appeal admitted is treated together with defamation.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose this picketing had taken place in front of his house, every day in front of his house.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, under Frisby v. Schultz, that would be a different situation. Under Frisby v. Schultz, this Court said --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Well -- well, then this -- this argument you're making, oh, never, never, the sky is falling and so forth, I -- I think we have to be more precise here. I think if it were in front of his house, it would be different. If he had alleged $10 worth of monetary damages, it would be disparaging the quality of his services, which would be a trade libel, and the Restatement at least -- I don't know California law -- says that you -- would you agree that you can enjoin a trade libel --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that disparages quality of goods to the serious injury of a -- of a business?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Actually, Your Honor, the vast majority of cases have held that you cannot have an injunction for product defamation. And so I think while that's a different and more difficult question, most courts have said no even there. And Your Honor, I'm not saying there can never be injunctions. But I am saying that this Court has said there's a very strong and heavy presumption against injunctions, and that never, not once in the 214-year history of the First Amendment, has this Court ever upheld an injunction as a remedy in a defamation action. And, Your Honor --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if -- if this under -- the underlying claim seems to be that Mr. Cochran is essentially being blackmailed; that is, this -- this -- your client wants tribute to go away. And you say, yes, but it's defamation. It's a defamation action. Therefore, damages is the only remedy. Is there nothing that one can do to stop another from engaging in blackmail?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, there is. If this was blackmail or extortion, Johnnie Cochran could have filed a criminal complaint with the police. He could have civilly sued for blackmail or extortion. But, Your Honor, this wasn't extortion.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What kind of a jurisprudence is it that a person can go to jail but that he's freed from an injunction? I mean, why -- why do we do this?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Your Honor, that's because this Court has said that injunctions of speech are even worse than criminal penalties. I would refer this Court --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but why -- is that true in every case? I mean, take the timid person who's not sure -- I know the law doesn't protect the timid person in the first area, but let's -- let's assume the timid person is not sure. So he wants -- he wants to get an equitable ruling first, declaratory judgment. He -- and he would take an injunction. That's certainly much easier than going to jail.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, I'd remind you of this Court's language in the Vance v. Universal Amusement where the Court said presumption against prior restraints is heavier and the degree of protection broader than against limits on criminal penalties.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I know, but I'm asking you why that -- why that should be. If -- if you asked a person not familiar with our jurisprudence, which is worse, having an injunction that you can argue about or going to jail, I -- I think they would say that going to jail is worse.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, in terms of the First Amendment, there are reasons why an injunction has always been regarded as worse.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Always? Do you want to apply that to an harassment action too against a woman who has the restraining order? No restraining orders in divorce cases in case they're against speech because even if violence is threatened, even if -- et cetera. I mean, how -- how far do you want to push that principle?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't want to push the principle at all to harassment. I believe that injunctions are completely appropriate in harassment actions. I think it is quite important to note that the California harassment statute expressly excludes speech which is protected by the First Amendment as being a basis for harassment. The history of the First Amendment is different. To go back to Justice Kennedy's question, it's always been thought that an injunction strikes at the very heart of the First Amendment because, as Justice Scalia pointed out --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why can't we say that speech that is -- is being used for extortion is different, just as speech which is being used for harassment is different? And just as you can get an injunction for the latter, you ought to be able to get an injunction for the former. Not all speech, but only when speech is being used to -- to extort money.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, there can be an injunction for extortion, but this was not extortion. There was never the criminal complaint. There was never the civil action. And it didn't meet the requirements for extortion. Your Honor, California law, Penal Code section 518, defines extortion as, quote, the obtaining of property from another with his consent induced by a wrongful use of force or fear. There wasn't the wrongful use of force or fear. Now, it may be that Ulysses Tory was speaking --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Here I think there was -- why isn't there a use of fear when, you know, you're afraid of this person destroying your business by calling you a liar and a cheat? Wasn't Mr. Cochran afraid of that -- of that happening?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, this Court is required to do an independent review of the record under Bose v. Consumers Union. There's no indication that Mr. Cochran suffered that fear from Mr. Tory being outside. It's true that Mr. Tory may have believed that he was owed money by Johnnie Cochran and was also trying to encourage Mr. Cochran to pay. But this Court has said in cases like NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware speech does not lose its protective character simply because it may embarrass others or coerce them into action.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, the district -- I mean, the trial court made certain findings and I'm looking at page 42 of the joint appendix. The first is that these statements were actually made for the purpose of inducing Cochran to pay Tory amounts of money which Tory was not entitled. That's one finding. And then finding 24, despite repeated requests, Tory has refused to cease picketing unless he was paid money -- a monetary settlement by Cochran. And then 27 that says this is simply use of false and privacy-invading communications to coerce or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for desisting from that type of activity. And those sound like findings. It's true that the label of extortion has been put on it, but it certainly does sound like the -- that the purpose of the speech was to extract money not owed.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, since this is a defamation action, not an extortion action, the rules under the First Amendment for defamation have to apply. Under the rules of the First Amendment for defamation, injunctions are not available to public officials or public figures.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, so this finding -- the court shouldn't have made these findings? It was irrelevant?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I believe that the --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was there an objection to the testimony that established this?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Tory, who was appearing pro se in the trial court, from the very outset objected that he was being held liable for speech protected by the First Amendment.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but it seems to me -- and I think what bothers me is -- is what bothers Justice Kennedy. It seems to me that the argument you just made is an argument that given the pleadings in this case, the findings that Justice Ginsburg just quoted really were irrelevant findings, that they should not have gotten -- that the court should not have gotten into extortion and so on and should not have provided a remedy for extortion, quite apart from the fact of whether it's an appropriate remedy, constitutional or otherwise. And that, it seems to me, is -- is something that we -- we are not here to touch. That's a question of California law. What we are here to touch is, number one, whether the injunction is overbroad with respect to pure speech, and maybe we are here -- that we have a question about the -- the breadth of the case we took. But maybe we are here to determine whether there can be an injunction against blackmail or harassing activities. But I -- I think we're not here to decide whether California could have gotten to the question of blackmail, harassment, and injunction for that. Do you agree with that?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. I certainly agree with the first point. One issue before this Court is whether this injunction is overbroad, and it clearly is in terms of the breadth of speech that's regulated and whose regulated. But as to the second point that you make, this is a defamation action, and thus the issue before this Court, clearly presented in the question presented, is whether a permanent injunction can be issued in a defamation case remedy when the plaintiff is a public figure.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it can certainly -- the -- the issue is certainly before us as to whether such an injunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure and simple. But the findings that Justice Ginsburg has -- has read and part of the order in question here seems to go beyond pure defamation. It goes to the kind of demonstrative activity which plausibly is found to have been in aid of extortion. And that, it seems to me, is an entirely different question. We may -- I'm not saying we will, but we may agree with you that it's overbroad. We may agree with you that as to pure speech, you can't enjoin it. But that doesn't necessarily mean that every part of this injunction is wrong, and it seems to me it is irrelevant as to whether the -- the State of -- the courts of California should have reached extortion.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would disagree in this way, Your Honor. Bose v. Consumers Union makes clear that when it is a defamation action, this Court and every appellate court has to do an independent review of the record.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With respect to the defamation, pure and simple. I agree with you. We -- there is a heightened standard of review, but I don't think that addresses one way or the other what the standard should be when an action in the State courts has been treated as an action both for defamation and for extortion or harassment.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, it was not treated here as an action for extortion or harassment --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand. Mr. Chemerinsky, let me put the question this way. Suppose a State does not have a civil action for extortion. It provides criminal remedies but no civil action for extortion. Why does the Constitution not permit us to treat, in that State at least, a civil action for defamation which has within it elements of distortion differently from pure defamation?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I would say the history of the First Amendment is different. A State can create a civil action then for extortion at the urging of this Court, but if you open the door to injunctions in defamation cases, then there's the possibility that in any defamation case, somebody might plead something about extortion, and injunctions will not be rare but will be the norm.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask this -- may I ask this question? Supposing the only thing he did was to carry a sign that said Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief, and the trial judge finds that is false, and he's carrying it in a sign, could the trial judge enjoin him from carrying that sign in front of Johnnie Cochran's office?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, because the law is clear that injunctions are not a permissible remedy in defamation cases.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What's the best authority you have for that proposition?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Near v. Minnesota would be the best authority where this Court said clearly that injunctive relief should not be awarded in a defamation case.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Add to Justice Stevens' -- add to Justice Stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he's losing some clients.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, even -- yes, Your Honor. But I don't think that changes the hypothetical in terms of enjoining the defamatory speech.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would you add too that he's judgment-proof?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, again, as I said to Justice O'Connor, I don't think it can matter whether he's judgment-proof because we can't have a different rule that we allow poor people's speech to enjoin and not wealthy people.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're saying -- you're saying that a State cannot constitutionally prohibit someone from making false statements in front of the business that causes the business to lose money.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, there are other causes of action that may allow that. If it could be --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So I'm -- my question is, is this constitutional to prohibit this conduct?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not in a defamation action, Your Honor.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that's not the question.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what is your authority for that proposition?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I would say that the authority comes from the fact that never in 214 years has this Court ever upheld an injunction in a defamation case.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Have we ever set aside an injunction that did that?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, not under those facts.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Have we done it either way?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. That's correct, Your Honor.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Have we ever -- have we ever considered a case where there's a strong element of extortion involved?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would say yes, extortion for Austin v. Keith. There was speech to pressure, and yet this Court said even though the speech was to pressure, it's still protected by the First Amendment. I'd like to save the rest of the time for rebuttal, if that's permissible.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Very well, Mr. Chemerinsky.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Cole, we'll hear from you.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4492 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court: For years, Mr. Tory has relentlessly targeted Johnnie Cochran with a pattern of defamatory speech in a public forum for purpose of causing Mr. Cochran to pay Mr. Tory money in tribute for ceasing from this unprotected activity. He admitted at trial he intended to engage in this conduct. He was doing it just so he could be paid money, and when asked if he would continue to do so, he stated he would.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, do you -- do you defend the injunction in its entirety?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, the -- the -- Mr. Chemerinsky didn't have too much chance to -- to get very far into it, but one of his points was that there was -- quite apart from any injunction against picketing, harassment, et cetera, there was an injunction simply against speech on a given subject directed to a lot of people with no limit of time. With respect to that last aspect, do you defend the injunction?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. First of all, I don't believe it was directed to a lot of people. As this --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it was directed, number one, to a named person who was not a party to the case, and it was directed to agents and employees of -- of the named party. So, I -- I assume that Mr. Cochran probably has a fair number of agents and employees, so it does seem like a large number of people.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I believe this Court said in Madsen that that would raise an abstract controversy that Mr. Tory doesn't have standing to attack the injunction for other persons who are not before the court. No aider or abetter has ever been served with this injunction. Ms. Craft has never been served with this injunction. Only Mr. Tory. So I don't believe --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let me ask you a law school question. In -- given the injunction on its face, with that breadth, is that injunction defensible with respect not to picketing, not to harassment, simply to speech in a public place?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I defend the injunction, and respondent defends the injunction on the ground that it is conduct that was being enjoined --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I asked you --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- from the use of unprotected speech.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to exclude the -- the issue of conduct. I said forget the injunction for a moment with respect to picketing, with respect to harassment, and we'll say with respect to blackmail, since that has come up. Forget that. Simply take the portion of the injunction that enjoins speech by these people, associates, agents, et cetera. On the subject matter of the injunction for all time, do you defend that injunction?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4504 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, we defend the injunction.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4505 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let's take specifically the words of the injunction. It's against orally uttering statements about Cochran, just orally uttering statements about Cochran.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You say that someone can be enjoined --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Based upon the unique facts of this case, Justice Ginsburg, I say somebody can be enjoined. I don't say that in the abstract.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you can't square that with the Near case at all. I -- I mean, the -- the injunction on its face in part 2 has the appearance of being overly broad.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But in Near, they set forth certain factors, and those factors included that it was not a private redress of private wrongs. The information was of legitimate public concern. Neither of those elements are present in this action.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4511 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You don't know that.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You don't --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You don't know what future speech is going to be. His future thing may be, you know, Johnnie Cochran shouldn't be elected mayor of San Francisco. That would be a -- a question of public concern.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, Justice Scalia, what I'm relying on is the fact that he has engaged in 3 years in a pattern of continuing, repetitive conduct.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what -- what you're saying is that an -- an injunction can be overbroad based on past wrongful conduct. And there is simply no authority for that proposition.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not suggesting that this injunction is necessarily overboard based upon that proposition because I believe there are --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But we have just pointed out that it -- that it -- it prohibits lawful, harmless, truthful speech.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I disagree with that, Justice Kennedy.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it does on its face. I mean, it is clearly overbroad. Now, what should we do about that?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if you're asking me, based upon the breadth of the injunction, what I -- if -- if there was -- are you asking me what I would do to modify the injunction? You could merely strike -- you could leave intact paragraph 2 and you could strike simply subsections (ii) and (iii) as being unconstitutionally overbroad.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, let -- let me ask you about that. Let's -- let's assume, for the moment, that a majority of the Court would find that some of these provisions are overly broad. Is there any authority that tells us what to do next? This is not like a statute where we have to save the statute. Do we have any obligation to save the injunction? Send it back and let it be done. Let it be done all over again. I mean, why -- why should we rewrite it up here? Do you have any authority that requires us or permits us to do that?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. In -- in Madsen, Justice Kennedy, you struck -- the Court struck certain provisions as being unconstitutionally overbroad and left certain intact. So there's no reason why you can't look at this injunction, which clearly does not attack paragraph 1. The -- they do not attack paragraph 1. They do not attack paragraph 3. They only level their attack at paragraph 2, and paragraph 2, by striking subsections (ii) and (iii), would then be limited to the exact conduct in issue, which is picketing.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So -- so if -- before leaving that point, what the injunction prohibits is that Tory and those acting in concert, cooperation, or participation with him from, in a public forum, orally uttering statements about Cochran. All right. That's what it says. Now, do you think that if Tory or someone acting in cooperation with him says, I've had a change of heart, Johnnie Cochran is a marvelous person, and he says that on television -- do you think that individual at that time has violated this injunction?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely not.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely not. Because? Because?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ First of all, that's --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It said the words. They violated the words. It was a statement, but he has not violated the injunction because?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because I don't believe that's a public forum.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, no, no. He does it in a public forum. In fact, he hires Disney Hall. (Laughter.)
03-1488 +++$+++ 4530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And moreover, he gets on stage and announces it. Okay? There's no problem about a public forum. So, now, why doesn't it violate the injunction?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your -- Your Honor, I believe there are alternative channels of communication here.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I thought what you were going to say -- but you're not. So I'm very interested in that, and I'm glad I asked. I thought you were going to say when it says uttering statements, it means statements of the kind or identical to those we have identified earlier in this opinion.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I was --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, now, you haven't said that. I said it, and I think it's too late for you to say it. (Laughter.)
03-1488 +++$+++ 4535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think I said it when I said there was a continuing pattern of repetitive conduct under Pittsburgh Press, over 3 years that that was the conduct that he has engaged in. And that was clearly the purpose of this injunction, Justice Breyer. We know that. And the purpose of the injunction is to enjoin conduct that's designed to extort money from Mr. Cochran.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In more than one case, we've said that an injunction has to be precise and clear and not leaving things to the imagination.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think this is precise and clear. Based upon the breadth of the injunction, it's very clear. Based upon this man's prior repetitive conduct of defaming Mr. Cochran with unprotected speech for the purpose of attempting to extort money from him --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's -- it's --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But nothing in the injunction refers to prior conduct.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. It's --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The injunction just speaks for itself. It doesn't say what -- doing what you used to do or anything like that.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The injunction --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You cannot picket Cochran or Cochran's law firm. Period.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If we restricted the injunction to specific words used such as you cannot picket Johnnie Cochran's law firm and say he's a crook, liar, and thief, the response will be that he'll come up with five new words to defame Mr. Cochran for purposes of extorting --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, maybe there are different grades of specificity. Maybe it doesn't meet precisely the same words, but I think there are other ways to draft it that say no picketing. Period.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there could be no picketing for purposes of -- no -- which contains defamatory speech for purposes of extorting Mr. Cochran. But --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All I'm suggesting is just draft it -- just excising (ii) and (iii) from paragraph 2 would not necessarily solve the problem completely. Because subparagraph (i) says picketing Cochran or Cochran's law firm, which is a pretty broad prohibition.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I would disagree based upon the prior -- continuing course of -- of repetitive conduct and the fact that this -- over a period 3 years, once a week, this man spent 3 to 4 hours a day of his time defaming Mr. Cochran at his law office. When we enjoined him from doing so at his law office, he moved it to the Los Angeles Superior Court. And I think the fact that Mr. Cochran is a public figure actually favors the breadth of this injunction. If this was not a public figure, then the public forum issue would not be as effective. But because Mr. Cochran is a public figure, the only way he gets protection is in the public forum because this gentleman could move his picketing down to west L.A., Santa Monica Boulevard, nowhere near a courthouse, and to a public figure he can inflict the same damage to reputation. And that is the problem we were contending with in attempting to draft an injunction that was not overbroad and yet could control Mr. Tory --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- you did draft this injunction. It wasn't the -- an inspiration from the judge unaided by your advocacy. Is that so?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This -- the terms of this injunction.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Were aided -- were aided by my advocacy, Your Honor.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Aided and abetted.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well said, Justice Rehnquist. What I'm suggesting here is Mr. Cochran would have been faced with -- he has no remedy. Injunctive relief is the only remedy. And he would be faced with a multiplicity of actions --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why? Why couldn't he just be enjoined from -- from similar defamation? I mean, this -- this enjoins him from -- from true speech. At least he could -- he could have been enjoined from in the future defaming Cochran in the same manner. And if he did that, then -- then he could be punished.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think we would be -- that injunction then would be attacked on being vague or ambiguous, that Mr. Tory wouldn't have sufficient notice as to what he was allowed to say and not allowed to say. I guarantee you that was --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if -- if that's so, then maybe Mr. Chemerinsky is right. We -- we shouldn't have injunctions. If you're saying that injunctions can't be narrowly tailored, it seems to me that you're playing right into the argument that the petitioner is making.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I think they can be tailored. I just don't think they can be that narrowly tailored. And I don't think in this case, which I believe that the test we should be applying if we're going to balance, is this -- there's no need for this injunction to be drafted in the least restrictive means. I also continue to advance the argument that this -- the facts of this case are unique. It's the use of speech to engage in unprotected conduct. This -- this conduct is not protected by the First Amendment. The conduct of attempting to extort money from Mr. Cochran is not protected. If that is not protected, then I believe we can craft --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You can -- you can certainly have, you know, some unprotected speech in connection with extortion, like give me $5 million or I'll shoot you. But that -- this was a far cry from that. In other words, it isn't just addressing the victim and saying give me something. It's denouncing the victim, which gets into free speech here.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It certainly does, Justice Rehnquist. But what I am suggesting is there was no remedy for Mr. Cochran that would have avoided a multiplicity of actions other than to draft the injunction in a form that would preclude Mr. Tory from engaging in the same conduct without regard to whether it was -- and to let him know clearly -- give him a safe harbor as to what he could and could not say.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the injunction isn't limited to the same conduct.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4562 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I don't think it needs to be because of the pattern and practice that this man has engaged in over 3 years. And if we take the example, which is so he has a change of heart and suddenly he now wants to praise Mr. Cochran and that's become his -- and he's going to promote him as mayor of San Francisco, he can certainly go into the court and modify the injunction.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought he lived in L.A. (Laughter.)
03-1488 +++$+++ 4564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think he'd like to get him up to San Francisco. (Laughter.)
03-1488 +++$+++ 4565 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He can certainly seek to modify the injunction, and that, as I pointed out in a subsequent letter brief, there's -- California doesn't adopt the collateral bar rule. And therefore, he has a check and balance in this case. Under People v. Gonzales, 12 Cal.4th 805, the collateral bar rule has no application in the State of California. So in the unlikely event that Mr. Tory was engaged in speech praising Mr. Cochran, one, and two, in the -- in the more unlikely event that someone was going to attempt to cite him for contempt for engaging in protected speech, he could contest, under First Amendment grounds, the enforcement of this injunction in the State of California because the collateral bar rule has no impact.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4566 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm -- I'm baffled by that. What you're saying is that the injunction -- we're just all wasting our time? The injunction doesn't mean anything?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4567 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no, no. Justice Kennedy, all I'm saying is --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I fell off the track here.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All I'm -- all I'm saying is that if the collateral bar rule was in effect, you would waive your right to contest. You don't have a right to contest the constitutionality of the injunction on First Amendment grounds or constitutional grounds when it's seek to be enforced against you. That's not a defense in a contempt proceeding. California does not adopt that rule. Therefore, Mr. Tory can always -- if he is engaged in protected speech, he can easily contend --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, yes, but he's different from other citizens because he's at -- he's at risk of a contempt citation.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't dispute that.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, his speech is being chilled with -- with respect to protected speech.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there's nothing unusual --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So the collateral bar rule doesn't help you at all because he's subject to a contempt citation.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He's subject to it, but there's a check and balance there in terms of when you balance, the potential remedy for Mr. Cochran -- what -- what is going to give Mr. Cochran the remedy he needs? And if we balance that against the -- the breadth of this injunction, I think we have to look at -- one of the biggest concerns about prior restraints, when analyzed in terms of injunctions, is the collateral bar rule.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it would be so easy. I mean, it's virtually no burden. I take it what you're saying is that this injunction in paragraph 2 at its heart is aimed at in public forums, keeping insults suggesting he was a crook against Johnnie Cochran unless you pay me $10,000. Then I'll stop. Okay? Now, at its heart, that's what it's aimed at.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's exactly --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you are saying if in fact it's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a defense. It would violate the First Amendment. But since it's so easy just to write those words we just said right in paragraph 2, why shouldn't the judge have to do it? It's so easy. Say this is aimed at the heartland just as I said it and you said it, and it doesn't apply outside of it.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I have no dispute with that, Justice Breyer. I agree that was the whole purpose for the injunction. That's the basis of the injunction. And you could always remand for further proceedings, consistent with any opinion you would write, that the injunction has to be tailored to -- to deal with defamatory conduct, which is designed to extort or with the intent to extort. And I --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's what he's arguing. You're -- you're conceding that it's overbroad.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm saying if this Court -- well, I'm gleaning the impression that this Court thinks it's overbroad.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ah, you're very perceptive. (Laughter.)
03-1488 +++$+++ 4583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And having gleaned that perception, I'm trying to suggest that, number one, there was no attack on paragraphs 1 and 3, and now we're focused on paragraph 2. And paragraph 2 can be tailored, as you have indicated, Justice Scalia, I think consistent with First Amendment issues. And I think it's important to point out that if we take away injunctive relief in a defamation action in this day -- modern age --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're sort of saying the opposite of what your opponent said. If we take it away, has it ever been there?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's never been there.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What are we taking away?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I agree it's never -- you've never found it there and you've never said it can't be there.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How does California work in that respect? Because what I've been thinking of in my mind is that maybe we shouldn't decide this in terms of State law boxes, that California seems to have an action. Let's call it a buzz action to get away from words. And what that action is it's a defamation but a certain kind. It's defamation accompanied by extortion. And when you have defamation accompanied by extortion -- call it whatever you want -- an injunction is proper in these circumstances. Now, can we decide it in such a way that we're not talking about all defamation actions? We are talking about this beast in California which uses the word defamation but also finds injunction and therefore issues -- also finds extortion and therefore issues an injunction.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, I think that you could limit the injunction to defamatory speech of a similar nature designed to extort.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would -- would that make Mr. Cochran happy? What -- what's the big deal about extortion? I mean, suppose this same conduct occurs in the future, but he doesn't say I'll stop if you give me a lot of money. He just pickets every day and says Cochran is a shyster, don't do any business with Cochran. Do you think Mr. Cochran would be any -- any happier simply because the guy says I'll -- hasn't said I'll stop if you pay me $10,000?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, and I think that would be subject to the same injunctive relief. I think this case is unique with the extortion element, but I don't disagree, Justice Scalia, that that is why any decision that says injunctions in defamation actions would be improper. I think people would start defaming with impunity.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You've got to give us some line. I mean, the only reason we're grabbing onto extortion is that -- that there's reluctance to say you can issue injunctions in all defamation actions. Now, what -- what limitation do you want to place upon the ability to issue an injunction if it is not defamation combined with extortion?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think you need to place a limitation other than you can enjoin the defamatory conduct. Take, for example, the Internet. A posting goes on of a -- of a business that -- a startup company. It can't -- damages of -- for a startup company -- they're very difficult to prove.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But then you run into the public figure. I mean, that's a much more dangerous kind of rule of law, isn't it? I mean, a pure defamation action against a public figure, which they want to say this is. You can write all kinds of things about public figures. People can and do, for better or for worse. Do -- is there any authority for issuing in a pure defamation action an injunction?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There's no authority, but there's no authority that says you can't do it. But what I am suggesting is in -- is in a pure defamation action that's not tied to any specific wrongful conduct, there's no reason why you couldn't enjoin. For example, if you found that a specific item was defamatory on its face, such as a posting on the Internet, the only way to get that posting off the Internet would be to enjoin it because damages aren't going to solve the problem. And if it's -- even if it's purely defamatory, you could restrict it to that purely defamatory posting, similar to -- to the obscenity cases where you've reviewed a film, you found it to be obscene, and then you preclude it. There are procedural safeguards and you preclude it in the future.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you've just said something that I think that's inconsistent with your earlier presentation. You said you could enjoin that posting. Here you said it wouldn't be effective just to enjoin the particular placards that were used, the particular words because then there would be other words. So the same question could come up with an Internet posting if you had an injunction not simply on what was posted but anything about this particular individual that might be posted in the future.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think where that leaves us is you'd have to engage in some sort of balancing about the -- how narrowly tailored the injunction is and does it provide a sufficient remedy and, you know -- and -- and in this -- and what test we would analyze it under, strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or the Ward test. And -- and I think that in applying those tests, you'd have to come to a balance, and if the balance is that you're going to limit it to a specific type of speech or -- then that -- that would be a -- a reasonable limit, and if it creates a multiplicity of actions, well, so be it. But at least there's a remedy for that posting or postings of a similar nature. So --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, you -- you -- to the extent that you're complaining about extortion-like conduct, something else that you drafted -- I'm looking at the complaint on page 7 of the joint appendix. You have identified all defamatory, including with the false light invasion of privacy, but you don't have any claim that looks like blackmail.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you'd -- if I could direct you, Justice Ginsburg, to page 12 of the joint appendix at paragraphs (j) and (k) of the verified complaint, you will see that we alleged in a verified complaint that he'd engaged in three previous efforts of this same type of conduct, one. And two, paragraph (k), that Tory is in the business of professionally extorting monies from innocent persons and business --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I was going to ask you about that. Were there findings to substantiate the allegations?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Findings to substantiate --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Specifically about the extorting money from the bank and the oil company.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Justice Kennedy, there were not.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No findings.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There was some testimony only on one of those issues, which was the oil company. There was no findings on this issue. But then I would refer you to paragraph (k) which specifically refers to extorting of monies. And also in my opening statement, as is reflected in the trial's transcript, the -- the first thing I said is this is speech designed for an improper purpose. It's unprotected speech designed to extort money from Mr. Cochran. That was the whole theme --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what -- what I mean is could you have -- without using the label defamation, have stated a claim for extortion or blackmail? I'm not looking at your particular allegations but how you described on page 1 of the complaint what you were suing for: libel, libel per se, slander, slander per se, and invasion of privacy.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think we could have pled extortion had we chose to. We could have pled inference with advantageous business relations. We probably could have pled California's --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does California law require you to label the type of the cause of action or is it notice pleading based on facts?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Notice pleading based on facts, but we do label the causes of action. The -- the point I'm trying to make is whether every cause of action was pled, if the conduct is extortion, which is what the judge implicitly found by findings 20 and 27, that conduct is not protected. And whether we named the cause of action correct in the complaint or we sued for that specified cause of action, doesn't change what it is that we were seeking relief for, which is stopping this man from defaming Mr. Cochran until he was paid money. We attempted to achieve that. We thought we did a fair job in paragraphs 1 and 3, which they don't attack and I agree is not fairly included within the question which has been certified here, nor is an attack on the underlying finding. But we attempted in paragraph 2, broadly I agree, to avoid a multiplicity of actions and to give Mr. Tory other channels of communication other than the public forum where he is engaged in a continuing course of repetitive conduct to defame Mr. Cochran. He -- and -- and this is -- one point that I want to stress. We don't view this injunction as being violated if he went on TV, he went on the radio, he went in the newspapers. We don't view those as public forums under the definition that this Court has provided. Those are not public forums. We are not concerned about that. We do not believe that those events will occur. We did not seek to protect them. So we have given Mr. Tory an unlimited venue to speak, but we said you can't do this in the public forum because of your continuing course of repetitive conduct, 3 years, once a week, 52 times a year, over 150 times, 4 hours a day. And with that, I would submit that while the injunction is broad, I don't believe it's a unconstitutional prior restraint, and to the extent this Court believes it is overbroad, I believe striking subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 2 would solve the problem, or alternatively, that in conjunction with a suggestion that it needs to be narrowed to deal with the speech and conduct in issue. Thank you.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Cole. Mr. Chemerinsky, you have 4 minutes remaining.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4612 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. Justice Breyer kindly invited my thoughts about how an opinion might be written, and there are three different ways not mutually exclusive. One is that this injunction is vastly overbroad for all the reasons that have been identified. Mr. Cole said a couple of things. One, he said that Mr. Tory can go to court and ask for modification of the injunction, but that's what makes this a prior restraint, that Mr. Tory can only speak again if he goes to court and gets permission. Also, he said at the end that Mr. Tory can go before the media. However, under California law, under Damon v. Ocean Hill, the media is defined as a public forum. A second way the opinion could be written is that this for speech protected by the First Amendment. Justice Ginsburg, you asked me at the outset whether that's in the scope of the question presented. Well, it is directly relevant to what Mr. Cole was saying. Because it's all opinion, all hyperbole it is protected by the First Amendment and can't be the basis for an extortion claim.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4613 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but you're asking us now to -- the -- the trial court found there was defamation, and now you want to argue, no, it wasn't defamation. It was mere opinion. I really don't see how that's included in the question presented.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4614 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it is because it goes to the question whether the injunction is permissible. But I go on to the third way that the opinion could be written, and that's that injunctions are not permissible as a remedy in a defamation case. We agree that if there is a cause of action for extortion, it can have an injunction as a remedy. We agree if the cause of action is for harassment, there can be an injunction as a remedy. But those have specific elements that have to be met. Those elements weren't met in this case. History is clear that injunctions aren't allowed in defamation cases, and also, Your Honor, it's quite important that Mr. Cole even said you can't craft a narrow injunction in a defamation case. Any injunction is either too narrow or too broad. In Near v. Minnesota, this Court said that it was telling that in 150 years of the history of the First Amendment, there had never been an injunction approved by this Court in a defamation case. We're now 70 years later than that. To approve an injunction in a case like this, even though it's called defamation plus extortion, will open the door to injunctions as a routine matter in defamation cases across the country. No --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4615 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There have been -- there have been injunctions against harassing conduct, threatening, stalking.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, and we have no objection to injunctions of that sort. What we object to is an injunction as a remedy in a defamation case and an injunction that is directed at speech. That's what the First Amendment prohibits. Thank you.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky. The case is submitted.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4621 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll now hear argument in Van Orden against Perry. Mr. Chemerinsky.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4623 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Good morning, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: On the grounds of the Texas State Capitol, there is one evident religious symbol that conveys a powerful religious message that there is a theistic God and that God has committed rules for behavior. Of course, the government may put religious symbols on its property, including the Ten Commandments, but must do so in a way that does not endorse religion or a particular religion, but does not have the purpose of advancing religion, but does not favor any particular religion.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, I suppose that opening statement suggests that you think that Thanksgiving proclamations are also unconstitutional, which were recommended by the very first Congress, the same Congress that proposed the First Amendment.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, I would - I'm sorry.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They also refer to one God, to a theistic ruler of the universe.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, I think the Thanksgiving proclamations would be constitutional. I think it's analogous to the legislative prayers that this Court upheld in Chambers v. Marsh. I think it's very different than this Ten Commandments monument.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. But then you have to narrow your opening statement and say that certainly the State can acknowledge the existence of a unitary God without offending the Establishment Clause.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, but it all depends on how it is done. Here the way in which it is done is the most powerful and profound religious message that this Court has ever considered on government property. Here you have a monument that proclaims not only there is a God, but God has dictated rules for behavior for those who follow him or her.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know whether that's any more profound or ultra-religious, super-religious than the prayer that the chaplain gives every day in the House.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, there is a difference between a prayer that a chaplain gives -- in Chambers v. Marsh, this Court emphasized that the prayer by the chaplain was a nonsectarian prayer. This is very much sectarian. This proclaims that there is a God. It proclaims --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I mean, I haven't read the prayer. So I would be surprised if I went through all the prayers and there was no mention, direct or indirect, of the Ten Commandments or a couple of them.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I would be surprised because here, if you look at these commandments, it's that God has claimed that he is the only God, prohibiting idolatry, prohibiting graven images, prohibiting taking the name of the Lord and God in vain. Requiring observing of the sabbath. This is God dictating to God's followers rules for behavior.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is there any other -- I mean, you can continue if you want, but one difference which I've written down is you say that the difference between this and the prayer is that this is more profoundly religious. Is there any other difference, in your opinion?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I think the key difference is --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the difference? So if I happen to read these prayers in the Congress and I came to the conclusion that in terms of a religious message, I actually thought the prayers had the more religious message, then I should vote against you.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. There are, of course, other differences. As I said to Justice Scalia earlier, with regard to legislative prayer in Chambers versus Marsh, this Court said that there was a history going back to the very first Congress that allowed there to be those kinds of religious invocations. Ten Commandments monuments standing by themselves, as they do here, certainly are not of that historic origin.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How about if they're packaged in a museum-like setting and there is some interest on the part of the State in preserving something.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And displaying a whole variety of things?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, there can be Ten Commandments or any religious works as part of a museum setting. This isn't a museum setting, Your Honor. Every monument on the Texas --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is this a kind of a park? What do we regard this space as? What is it? Is it a park-like setting?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is a park-like setting. It is the acres of the State Capitol grounds. Every monument on the State Capitol grounds is there because the State legislature wanted to convey a particular message. It is a felony in Texas, an impeachable offense to put anything on the Capitol grounds without the approval of the legislature. Most of the monuments are there to honor war veterans. This is the only religious message anywhere on the Capitol grounds. And by itself --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, would it be all right, in your view, if they put several others up for different religions? Then is it going to be okay?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the clear purpose and message was to honor the diversity of religions in Texas, it would then be permissible. If it were a series of displays like that frieze, the fifteen different --

03-1500 +++$+++ 4647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Quite the contrary, I think it's a --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or the depiction on the door of the Court?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Quite the contrary. This is exactly how the State may display the Ten Commandments.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the prayers in Congress don't do that and our Thanksgiving proclamations don't do that. They invoke a God, a unitary God, and that's contrary to the dictates of some religions that believe that there are a lot of gods.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, there is --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't pray to gods, the prayers are always to God. You know, I don't see why the one is good and the other is bad. It's no answer to say, well, you know, the former has been around for a long time. Well, it has but it suggests what the framers and what our society for several hundred years has believed the Establishment Clause means. And it does not -- it is not too sectarian if it invokes a unitary God. Now, you're saying it becomes too sectarian when it invokes the Ten Commandments.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. I'm saying several things. As I said earlier, first, this Court in Chambers v. Marsh said that there was a unique history to legislative prayers. There isn't a similar history here.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, too, doesn't the venue count? After all, we have had the question of prayer in schools, and the Court has said that that was not all right. Prayer in the legislature was distinguished. So it's not just prayer anywhere that the government wants to have it is okay.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, Justice Ginsburg, the venue counts. And here the venue is very important. It is the corner between the Texas State Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court. And in that way, this monument standing alone does convey the government's endorsement for religion.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. But if the legislature itself can have its sessions opened with a prayer, can the legislature itself want to have the Ten Commandments posted within the legislative halls?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I think there is a very different message that's conveyed.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can it do that?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, it can't post the Ten Commandments by itself in its legislative halls because that would then be the government endorsing expression for support for that message. It cannot be, Your Honor, that just because there is a legislative prayer, that any religious message anywhere on government property would then be permissible. As Justice Kennedy has said in his opinion for --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's so hard to draw that line. If the legislature can open its own sessions attended by the public with a prayer, you say it cannot, in the same building, display the Ten Commandments.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right, because the message from the government is quite different. The message with legislative prayers, as this Court found in Chambers v. Marsh, is a recognition of a long historical practice. But when it comes to the Ten Commandments, it really is different than even a legislative prayer. This declares not only there is a God, but that God has proclaimed rules for behavior. The Ten Commandments come from sacred texts. As Justice Kennedy said in his opinion of County of Allegheny, certainly a city council could not put atop the city hall building a large Latin cross, even if that city council begins every day with a prayer. It cannot be there just because some religious messages are allowed, like a prayer, that everything then becomes permissible.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you know, in the First Amendment speech area, we're very, very strict. A moment's delay in publication is a constitutional crisis. And I'm not sure that we should carry that over to this area, where there is this obsessive concern with any mention of religion. That seems to me to show a hostility to religion. I just don't see a balanced dialogue in our cases or in these kinds of arguments.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't believe there should be an obsessive concern with religion. If the Ten Commandments are displayed as part of an overall display of law givers, like that frieze, it's permissible. But when you put sacred texts somewhere on government property, then the message is that the government is endorsing --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This is a classic avert your eyes. If an atheist walked by, he can avert his eyes, he can think about something else.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think so, Your Honor. This Court has said the key is that the government can't endorse religion, in a way that makes some feel like insiders and some like outsiders. Imagine somebody who is Muslim or Buddhist or Hindu --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask you this question. Supposing -- I recently read a case from the Seventh Circuit on what they did in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. And as we all know, this organization has donated Ten Commandments monuments all over the country. And what they did there is they sold the parcel back to the Eagles, their name, and put up a sign which read, this property is not owned or maintained by the City of Lacrosse, nor does the city endorse the religious expression thereon. Now, my question to you is, if there were a similar disclaimer on this monument, would that be an adequate remedy, in your view?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would be a harder case, but I don't think it would be an adequate remedy. And the reason is the city cannot put a religious symbol standing alone on government property just through disclaimer. That's exactly what County of Allegheny was. There the nativity scene in the courthouse had a plaque saying it was donated by others, but that can't excuse it because otherwise the city could put the large Latin cross just with a disclaimer.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if the test is whether the reasonable observer would think that the government is endorsing the religious message, wouldn't the disclaimer make it clear to the reasonable observer the government was not endorsing the message?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think the disclaimer would make it a harder case, but I think when you're dealing with the ground in a Texas State Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court, that placement, when you're dealing with the Ten Commandments, sacred texts, I still think that the message the reasonable observer would be that this is the government endorsing religion.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At some point, would the State's interest in preserving old objects overcome the objection constitutionally?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, at some point, it could where it was clear to the reasonable observer that it was there because it was an old object.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How did this monument get there? Was it in -- is it true that it was put in as a result of promoting a movie about the Ten Commandments?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The record is unclear as to that. There are certainly many indications in the popular press that Cecil B. DeMille together with his movie, The Ten Commandments, worked with the Friends of Eagles to have these monuments put around the country. But there is nothing in the legislative history that links this particular monument to that.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't the display on the tablets on the top before you get to the text, before you get to, I am the Lord, thy God. I thought that those were replicas of what was in the film.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know that, Your Honor. I've tried to find out what that text is. It is not in Hebrew. It is not in a script that anyone was able to recognize. But it is important to notice that if you look at the entire monument, in addition to the Ten Commandments, there is also a Latin symbol of Christ, there is also Jewish Stars of David. And as I was saying in response to Justice Kennedy's question, imagine the Muslim or the Buddhist who walks into the State Supreme Court to have his or her case heard. That person will see this monument and realize it's not his or her government.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought Muslims accept the Ten Commandments.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, the Muslims do not accept the sacred nature of the Ten Commandments, nor do Hindus, or those who believe in many gods, nor of course, do atheists. And for that matter, Your Honor, if a Jewish individual would walk by this Ten Commandments, and see that the first commandment isn't the Jewish version, I am the Lord, thy God, took you out of Egypt, out of slavery, would realize it's not his or her government either.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You know, I think probably 90 percent of the American people believe in the Ten Commandments, and I'll bet you that 85 percent of them couldn't tell you what the ten are. (Laughter.)
03-1500 +++$+++ 4679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And when somebody goes by that monument, I don't think they're studying each one of the commandments. It's a symbol of the fact that government comes -- derives its authority from God. And that is, it seems to me, an appropriate symbol to be on State grounds.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I disagree, Your Honor. For the State to put that symbol between its State Capitol and the State Supreme Court is to convey a profound religious message. If you're just saying, now, this isn't there for its secular reason. If someone were to read this monument, one sees that it emphasizes its religious content.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is a profound religious message, but it's a profound religious message believed in by the vast majority of the American people, just as belief in monotheism is shared by a vast majority of the American people. And our traditions show that there is nothing wrong with the government reflecting that. I mean, we're a tolerant society religiously, but just as the majority has to be tolerant of minority views in matters of religion, it seems to me the minority has to be tolerant of the majority's ability to express its belief that government comes from God, which is what this is about. As Justice Kennedy said, turn your eyes away if it's such a big deal to you.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I disagree, Your Honor. Because this Court has said that above all, the government can't make some feel like they're insiders and some like outsiders. Even if they're the majority religion --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, suppose a non-Christian, say a Muslim, comes before a judge who has very strong Christian beliefs, a very religious person. Does he feel like an outsider? And to require that we pretend that there is no religious motivation, no deep religious conviction on the part of many of our public officials seems to me to be a hostility toward religion.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. Imagine that judge put the Ten Commandments right above his or her bench. That would make some individuals feel like outsiders. Of course, many judges have religious beliefs, but they can't have the religious beliefs above them. And Your Honor, that's not hostility to religion. As this Court said in County of Allegheny, excluding religious symbols like the nativity scene, when displayed by itself, is not hostility to religion. Last year in Locke v. Davie, this Court said that to deny funding through the State of Washington for scholarships was not hostility to religion. Enforcing the Establishment Clause is not about hostility to religion. It is about making sure that every person who walks into that courtroom can feel that it's his or her government.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's an important point to me, but I don't see any way to get there in these difficult cases without making a practical judgment about whether that's really so. And the reason I say that, I start with Goldberg's opinion with Harlan in Schempp. And I know there are a lot of others, but I don't know if we've found a satisfactory test. And the point that they make is the government should be noninvolved with the religious, and it can't favor one over the other. But at the same time, we are a religious nation, where most people do believe in God and most of our institutions flow from the religious nature of our people. The City on the Hill, proclaim liberty throughout the land. All of those are religious. So how can the government, without what they call the pervasive and brooding commitment to secularism, which they think would be wrong, become necessarily involved because of our traditions, but not go too far? Now, I come to the conclusion very tentatively, there is no way to do it other than look at the divisive quality of the individual display case by case. And when I do that, I don't find much divisiveness here. Now, I'm exposing the whole thing not because I'm accepting it, but I would love to hear what you think.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, I think that the test that this Court has formulated do draw those lines. With regard to your point about divisiveness, the Ten Commandments is enormously divisive right now. I don't think we can ignore the social reality. The chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court resigned, there are crowds outside today. I got hate messages this week, not because people care about the Ten Commandments as a secular document, but people care about the Ten Commandments because it's a profound religious message. And many want that religious message on government property. And I'm saying the government can put the Ten Commandments there as part of an overall display of law givers, because, Justice O'Connor, it's an overall display about diversity of religion. But when the Ten Commandments sits by itself it is, to use your word right now, enormously divisive. And that's why, from that criteria, it does violate the Establishment Clause.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What about the opening of this Court's session today, in a manner that has been used since John Marshall, is that divisive because there are a lot of people who don't believe in God.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But You Honor, I think that you have to distinguish between minimal religious content and maximum religious content.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, on that point, how much of the Ten Commandments -- I mean, once we get to thou shalt not kill or murder, then there are tenets to govern a society, but how much are strictly about the obligation that man owes to God?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The first of the two tablets, the first five commandments, Your Honor, and of course religions belief this was written in God's own hand and given to Moses. It's believed that the first five commandments that you were referring to are God's prescriptions for religious behavior. The latter five, the others that you're referring to, were God's commands for secular behavior. All of these are God's commands to God's people. And that's what makes it different than the minimal religious content of God save this Honorable Court that Justice Scalia was referring to. The core of Texas's argument seems to be that it's there for secular purposes. But of course, if one looks at this monument, one sees that it's emphasizing the religious content and there is nothing that would lend the reasonable observer to see the secular content. It says in large letters, I am the Lord, thy God.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, suppose, Mr. Chemerinsky, it was like Moses on that frieze where there are commandments showing, but there are only the sixth through tenth commandment. Would that be all right?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, if it was like Moses on that frieze together with fourteen other symbols, absolutely okay, because it would clear to the reasonable observer --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if we just had the Moses with the tablet that has the instructions for how people will conduct themselves in a civilized society versus worshiping the Lord.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that would still be unconstitutional between the Texas State Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court because it would still be the State of Texas expressing the message that there is a God and that God has dictated these rules for behavior.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, what if you go one step further and there was simply a tablet without any embellishment about source saying, you know, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet, et cetera, basically just the last five commandments, pure and simple. Would you have any objection on Establishment Clause grounds?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the tablets were by themselves in that way, between the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas State Capitol, it would be a harder case, but I believe it would still be unconstitutional because those tablets do convey a message that God --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I'm just talking about when I -- I don't know if I used the word tablet. I'm just talking about a piece of stone or a 10 poster that says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not 11 covet, thou shalt not bear false witness, et cetera. Would there be any Establishment Clause 13 objection simply because though it does not say so, those 14 were quotations from the last six commandments - last five commandments.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. If all 16 it said was thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not 17 steal, I don't think that that would be a problem 18 because, of course, those are a reflection of law.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Who are you kidding? I 20 mean, everybody knows that comes from the Ten 21 Commandments. And what that message says is that 22 these commands that are engraved on the human heart 23 come from God. Why put it that way? You know, 24 instead of that, just quote the State statute against 25 murder. That's not what they're doing. They're saying these basic principles of human behavior that we're governed by come from God. And that message would be conveyed so long as you use the terminology of the Ten Commandments. That's what the Ten Commandments stand for.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Your Honor, this Court has emphasized that content and context matter enormously. And what I'm trying to do is to distinguish the situation where in Texas, it was clearly tablets with the words, I am the Lord, thy God, with five commandments for religious behavior and five for secular behavior. From Justice Souter's question, there are five others and especially those that are reflected in State law, like thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not steal. I think that the message is different there. It is the words, I am the Lord, thy God.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think you're telling us that the State cannot accommodate religion. The only way they can do it is to put the Ten Commandments up and insist that it's always secular, whether it's predominantly for a secular purpose. It seems to me that's hypocritical and it's asking religious people to surrender their beliefs and that is not accommodation.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. I do think that it degrades religion to have to have the Ten Commandments defended for their secular purpose. I do think, though, that what's required of the government, when it puts religious symbols on government property, is to not be endorsing religion. That's why a nativity scene by itself in the County of Allegheny case was unconstitutional. On the other hand, that's why the nativity scene as part of a unified display in Lynch v. Donnelly was permissible. That's why, if the Ten Commandments are part of an overall display like this frieze, it's permissible. If it's part of an overall display about religious tolerance, and that's what the reasonable observer would see, it is permissible. But where it is the Ten Commandments themselves, placed as they are here, then it really is about the government endorsing religion, then it is the purpose of advancing religion and then it does violate the Establishment Clause.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So the word accommodate should not be within our jurisprudence?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Accommodate should very much be in the jurisprudence. And any time there is a Free Exercise Clause claim, then there has to be careful attention to accommodating religion. But there is no Free Exercise Clause claim in this case, Your Honor, so this isn't a case about accommodating anybody's religious beliefs. This is about the State expressing support for religion with sacred and solemn religious texts on government property. And my position is --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can the State express its support for religion generally?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, it would all depend
03-1500 +++$+++ 4707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose it didn't have the Ten Commandments, it just had a big thing that says religion is good. It said religion is the foundation of our institutions. Suppose there were something like that. Would that be bad?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think that would be a problem under the Establishment Clause because it's minimal --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there are atheists who disagree with that intensely.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Your Honor, I'm not arguing for a heckler's veto by atheists. What I am saying is that when the government puts sacred and solemn texts taken directly from the Bible at the core of its State government, it has to then do something to convey the message that it's not there for religious purposes, that it's there for secular purposes.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Doesn't it matter whether that text has acquired an independent meaning of its own? As I say, I don't think most people know what the text of the Ten Commandments are, but they do know that it stands for the fact that our laws are derived from God. That's what it stands for. Why isn't that symbolism sufficient to enable the State of Texas to use it?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Ten Commandments monument by itself conveys the message that the Ten Commandments are the source of law and it's that message the State can't convey. May I save the rest of the time for rebuttal?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, you may save your time.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ General Abbott, we'll hear for you, please.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4717 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Every court that has reviewed the specific facts of this case has agreed that the Texas monument is constitutional under this Court's well settled precedents in Lynch and Allegheny. This Court should agree that the Texas monument should not be torn down from its historical place for three reasons. First, the Ten Commandments is an historically recognized symbol of law. Second, this monument is one of the smallest of the 17 monuments on the Capitol grounds, and like most of the other monuments, was a gift to the State of Texas and is clearly recognized as such on the monument itself. And third, this monument has stood for more than 40 years without controversy on a national historic landmark. In fact, even the --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you this question? Under your analysis of the reason this is justifiable, would it equally be permissible to have a crucifix of the same size in the same location on the Capitol grounds?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4719 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, I think that would pose a much greater problem.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4720 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not my question. Do you think it would be permissible -- it seems to me your reasoning that you've given us would support that result. And maybe that's the correct result. I'm wondering what your view is.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4721 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I seriously question whether or not a crucifix would be constitutionally acceptable in that same location, and for the very same reasons which I'm articulating why the Ten Commandments would be acceptable in this location. The crucifix is not like the Ten Commandments in that it's not an historically recognized symbol of law. It doesn't send a secular message to all the people, regardless of whether or not they are believers or not believers of the important role the Ten Commandments have played in the development of law.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not a secular message. I mean, if you're watering it down to say that the only reason it's okay is it sends nothing but a secular message, I can't agree with you. I think the message it sends is that law is -- and our institutions come from God. And if you don't think it conveys that message, I just think you're kidding yourself.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, the Ten Commandments send both a religious message and a secular message. When people --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the district court, I think in this very case, found that commemorating the Ten Commandments' role in the development of secular law was not one of the State's purposes in accepting the monument. Now, will you accept that finding as the case comes to us? That hasn't been challenged. We don't have any cross appeal. I assume we accept that finding of the district court.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The Court obviously is correct to accept that finding. As you know, from the district court's finding, the secular purpose that was accepted by the district court was to honor the Fraternal Order of Eagles. But also there was an ongoing --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you're arguing for something contrary to the district court's finding.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm actually, Justice O'Connor, arguing for purposes that are in addition to that district court's finding because there was an ongoing purpose to retain this now historical monument that has stood for more than 40 years without controversy on a national and historic landmark.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So in another case, if a government official feels that the Ten Commandments have been very, very important in his or her life as a spiritual or religious matter and wants other people to know how important the Ten Commandments are, he cannot accept on behalf of the city the Ten Commandments. And so you can have no Ten Commandments in city A, but the Ten Commandments in city B. General, that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. And again, you're just doing with purpose what you did in response to Justice Scalia's question. You're asking us to ignore the religious purpose that is the most manifest value of these symbols.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, with regard to both purpose and effect in this particular setting, I don't think that religion was the driving force. I know that all of the evidence shows that religion was not a driving force in any respect.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4730 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I suppose that every monument that's on the State Capitol grounds in Texas in a sense conveys a message of State endorsement, State endorsement of the role of servicemen in fighting earlier wars or in support of the Boy Scouts or whatever it might be, doesn't it? I mean, by placing them there with the legislative approval, is that not really some kind of a message of endorsement for each one?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4731 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I may clarify an important fact and that is clearly the State of Texas, by displaying 17 monuments in a museum-like setting on the Capitol grounds, is trying to acknowledge and commemorate certain events. It's important for the Court to remember, though, that the State of Texas has specifically endorsed nine of those monuments by putting the State seal or the Lone Star seal for the State of Texas on those nine monuments. This monument does not have that kind of endorsement on there.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4732 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't it all the case, as has been pointed out, that no monument is going to be on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol without the approval of the legislature? You don't dispute that, do you?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4733 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not at all. That is very true.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you don't dispute that anyone going on those grounds would assume that the State government approved it or it wouldn't be there?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, of course the presumption would be that people on the Capitol grounds would assume the State of Texas wanted those monuments on the Capitol grounds.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm not sure that that endorsement -- in England, there is a square where they have King Charles on one hand -- on one end and he's looking at Oliver Cromwell, who beheaded him, on the other. I don't know if you have to endorse one or the other.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Kennedy, I believe that there is a very meaningful difference between this Court's standards of an endorsement and what a State or the nation may do with regard to commemoration. As an easy example, on the National Mall, there is, of course, the Lincoln Memorial and in the Lincoln Memorial, there is text from the King James version of the Bible. The nation commemorates and acknowledges Lincoln and what he has said. But by that display, the United States is not trying to endorse the King James version of the Bible or a particular religious message in that. Instead what the state
03-1500 +++$+++ 4738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you have to contend with the fact that the district court found that this sort of commemoration of the Commandments involved was not the objective in placing the monument there, so you're left basically with a religious text. And if anybody has any doubt about that, the religious text is surrounded by some religious symbols, the Chi Rho, the Star of David. So it seems to me that it's hard to find, if we accept the district court findings, that there's anything here but an expression of approval by the State of Texas for a religious expression, and only for the religious expression.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sir, all other factors, though, Justice Souter, as a person who stands in front of that monument clearly recognizes, centered in a specialized scroll is an indication that this was a monument that was dedicated and presented to the people and the youth of the State of Texas by the Fraternal Order of Eagles. There is no stamp of approval on this by the State of Texas on that monument.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you're not trying to withdraw the -- I took it to be the concession that of course anyone would reasonably assume that the State of Texas approved this message, and thought it was appropriate to devote state property to its promulgation.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Clearly the State of Texas approved of the monument being on the grounds --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But then the fact that the Eagles also approve it doesn't really get us very far, does it?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, where I believe it gets you, as this Court has recognized, there is a very meaningful difference between acknowledging something and endorsing something. For example, the creche in Lynch or the menorah in Allegheny.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me ask you this. If the Eagles' presentation statement weren't on there, would that make a difference to Establishment Clause analysis?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that the Eagles' disclaimer on there helps our case, but if it were not on there, I think the monument could still stand just as the creche did in Lynch or the menorah in Allegheny. The city of Pawtucket was not endorsing the creche in the display, it was acknowledged as part of the overall holiday celebration.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what do you do with the district court finding?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the district court finding obviously chose to decide that the secular purpose for the display was to honor the Fraternal Order of Eagles for their commitment to combating juvenile delinquency. But that is different -- the purpose why the district court found why the display was constitutional is different than the message that is being sent to the reasonable observer.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You had a second point and I don't want to miss your second point.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The second point is that there are other displays in this Court. As a person walks into this courtroom or exits the courtroom, they don't see the Ten Commandments in a display with a bunch of law givers. Instead, they see the Ten Commandments alone with an eagle above it.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They see blank tablets. They don't see any writing. This is the only one that has script on it. It has numbers and in fact that's confusing because one of them, the people think is the Ten Commandments is the Bill of Rights. (Laughter.)
03-1500 +++$+++ 4755 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, clearly the Ten Commandments that are reflected on the doorway into and out of this courtroom don't have words on them like the tablets do in the State of Texas.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4756 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But we know what they are, don't we?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do and that's the point. Even more importantly, the reasonable observer knows what --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But do we know which version of the Ten Commandments it stands for? There are three different versions at least.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I happen to agree with the Petitioner. There is more than three versions of the Ten Commandments. And the purpose, if you go back to what the Eagles were trying to achieve here, was to come up with a version of the Ten Commandments that wasn't reflective of any particular religion.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it doesn't matter what the version is, does it? If it just stands for the fact that laws -- the foundation of our laws is God. If that's all it stands for, who cares what the text is.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ General Abbott, would the Texas purpose be equally served if the monument had on it the kind of disclaimer that the city in Wisconsin put on its monument?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, I apologize, I'm not familiar with that disclaimer.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It reads this way. What they did is they sold the parcel of land that had the Eagles' donation on it back to the Eagles and then they put a fence around it and then they put this sign up, "This property is not owned or maintained by the City of Lacrosse, nor does the City endorse the religious expression thereon." Maybe as long as it's still on the property, it couldn't be the same. But suppose you had a comparable disclaimer. Would that defeat any of the purposes on which you relied to justify having the statue there?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ A disclaimer like that would surely ensure that this display is constitutional. However, it's our contention --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And would it undermine the message that you legitimately seek to convey?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't believe it would.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, why don't you do it and we wouldn't have this case? I really would consider it something of a Pyrrhic victory if you win on the ground that you're arguing. So that in all future cases, we're going to have to examine displays of the Ten Commandments to see whether there was ever any intent to say that our laws are ultimately dependent upon God. Is that what you want us to do case by case?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, this Court obviously has decided Establishment Clause cases on a case-by-case basis, but in this particular instance, the Ten Commandments displayed in a museum-like setting on the Capitol grounds arrayed among 17 other monuments, the message that is received by the viewer who is trekking through the Capitol grounds looking at monuments is clearly one not of the State of Texas.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I've got to get one question before you leave because you're the one who knows the record. And what I've had a hard time finding in the record is what I think there must be some material that the State or somebody in a tourist office or a guide or somebody tells people what the 17 different monuments are. And all I've found is the general brochure which doesn't tell them what they are. And I found something on the Internet. Well, which is in the record. But aside from this page from the Internet in the record and that, is there anything else in this record that if somebody wanders around, they're on the State grounds, they say, what is this, what are these things anyway? There must be something that tells them. And where is it?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The state provides a walking tour guide.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the brochure doesn't tell what they are. This thing, it says grounds?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, Justice Breyer, if I could refer you to page 205 of the Joint Appendix, it provides a description of each of the monuments on the walking tour. And if I could also refer the Court to page 117 of the Joint Appendix, it shows the actual walking tour where a person would go along the process of seeing the monuments. But clearly as they walk through the Capitol grounds, what any observer, not just the reasonable observer, what any observer would notice is that before they could even get to this particular monument, they will have passed in full view of countless other monuments and historical markers clearly indicating to them that they are not there for the purpose of seeing just the Ten Commandments but they are in a museum-like setting cast among many different kinds of monuments. And so they appreciate the setting before they even arrive at the Ten Commandments monument. Also when they arrive at the Ten Commandments monument, they will notice it is one of the smallest of the monuments on the Texas Capitol grounds. It does have the disclaimer on it indicating that it was donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles. It does not have the State seal on it like many of the other monuments, so it's not --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it like how many other monuments? This is not peculiar to Texas. The Order of the Eagles have given how many monuments just like this one, identical to this one?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, it is actually not clear from the record. There have been some accounts of hundreds, maybe even into the thousands that the Fraternal Order of Eagles have given out. And I cannot tell you for a fact that they are all identical.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ When you said that every court that has considered this case has said it's compatible with the Establishment Clause, did you mean just this Texas case or other cases involving an Eagles Ten Commandments?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, my reference was to the fact that every case that has considered the specific -- every court that has considered the specific facts of this case, meaning the Texas case --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you didn't mean this particular depiction of the Ten Commandments?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. What I meant is that both the district court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals specifically reviewed the facts of this case and were all in complete agreement that the facts of this case render this monument constitutional under this Court's well settled precedents in Lynch and Allegheny. One other thing I would like to draw the Court's attention to that will give you a very well understanding of what the monument looks like and its setting is the videotape that is Exhibit 44, it's obviously not part of the Joint Appendix, but it demonstrates how this particular monument is set in a museum-like setting amongst many other monuments and gives you the perspective of what the typical viewer would appreciate as they walk around the Capitol grounds.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Kind of an eclectic museum. One message that you get is that the State is honoring the donor of the various --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ General Abbott, I want to thank you for your argument and also for demonstrating that it's not necessary to stand at the lectern in order to a fine job. Thank you.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Your Honor.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Clement.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4784 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Ten Commandments have undeniable religious significance, but they also have secular significance as a code of law and as a well-recognized historical symbol of the law. When a State decides to display a Ten Commandments display along with more than a dozen other monuments on its Capitol grounds in order to honor the donor, it is not endorsing the religious text of the Ten Commandments. And in the same way, when a state has that monument as part of such a collection, the Establishment Clause should not be interpreted to force them to send a message of hostility to religion by singling out that one monument for removal solely because of its religious content.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Clement, can I ask you to address one thing that troubles me about the case? As I understand it, it's the Protestant version basically of the Ten Commandments we have before us, which has significant differences from the Catholic version and the Jewish version. And I understand it was the result of consultation and so forth. But I noticed in your brief, you list the States in which the Ten Commandments displays are listed, there is none for Rhode Island, which I often think of as primarily a Catholic state, and the only one from Massachusetts is a frieze on the north wall of the public library which apparently didn't have the text of the commandments in it. Is there any significance to the fact that this kind of display may be more popular in areas of the country where the Protestant religion is dominant as opposed to other versions of Christian religions?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, I don't think so. I mean, we didn't purport to do an exhaustive survey, but I think there is a well-represented group of displays throughout the country including, I think, in States that probably have relatively high Catholic populations. But I think we would steer this Court away from attributing too much significance to the fact that if a State is going to display the Ten Commandments at all, it will necessarily have to display a version that reflects one or another sect's preferences. I mean, in the Marsh case, for example, this Court upheld legislative prayer. It understood that they would necessarily have to choose a chaplain and that chaplain would necessarily be of one denomination or another. And this Court didn't doom the whole practice of legislative prayer because of the necessity of picking a chaplain of one denomination or another. In fact, in the Marsh case itself, this court upheld Nebraska's practice, even though they had chosen the same Presbyterian minister for 16 straight years. And so I don't think this Court in other Establishment Clause contexts has steered away from putting the States and municipalities in a catch-22. And given that this Court has suggested even in Stone against Graham that the Ten Commandments can be displayed, can be used in certain settings, it can't be that once the State in practice picks a particular version, it's all of a sudden guilty of a sectarian preference.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course, the other thing that was notable about your listing is most of the examples are examples of displays of the event itself rather than the text. And there is an argument made I think by Professor Laycock that when you display the entire text, it's kind of a different sort of symbol than when you just have a symbolic presentation.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Stevens, I think there are quite a few of both types of displays and I think the very fact that the Fraternal Order of Eagles put a lot of these displays out suggests that a bunch of them are textual displays. I'm not sure, though, that a display that actually has Moses receiving the Ten Commandments from God is any less religious. I would suggest that's actually more religious than one that just displays the monument standing alone. If the monuments are standing alone, you can I think appreciate the fact that maybe they're being displayed for their secular significance as well as their religious significance. When Moses is there, it's hard to avoid the implication that they are the revealed law of God, as opposed to also a secular code. So in that sense, I'm not sure that the variations in the display --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You think just a symbolic display is less objectionable than quoting the text as this monument does?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Stevens, I would say -- my point is not that there are not other ways to display it. I mean, certainly I think, as we point out in our brief, blank tablets or tablets with Roman numerals are less objectionable -- certainly, I don't think they're beyond objection -- than a textual display. My point was that I'm not quite sure how one would balance sort of four Commandments and Moses versus all Ten Commandments in text. I think it's a close call.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, except the four Commandments and Moses would avoid the differences between the three different versions of the Ten Commandments, whereas when you quote one, you must select one over the other two.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I guess I'm not sure that's true. I mean, some of the displays that are out there in courthouses have Moses receiving the Commandments and have text. And I guess, my point, though, would be, again --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Most of them don't.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To be sure, to be sure. But I would hope the constitutional line wouldn't be that you can't have text. I mean, the Ten Commandments have a role in our society and had an influence on the development of the law as text. I mean, you know, they weren't influential with ten Roman numbers. They were influential as text.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ General Clement, there is a question I have about the government's position. And does place matter at all? I mean, here we're talking about the grounds surrounding a State Capitol. What about every school room, if that's the choice of the school board? Is it the same or do you make -- or every courtroom up to the court to decide for itself?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, I certainly think location and context matters. I think in almost every Establishment Clause context, the setting and context matters a great deal. The school case, for example, as you suggest, I mean, unless this Court is going to revisit Stone against Graham, it's certainly true that the school context at least raises much more difficult questions. In terms of where it can be displayed in a courthouse, I think there are certainly permissible displays in the courthouse, but it may be something all together different to have a display in a way that it actually looks like a religious sanctuary within the walls of the courthouse.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky. The case is submitted.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4812 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We will now hear argument in Orff against the United States. Mr. Smiland.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4814 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The relevant language of the 1963 contract, as illuminated in the surrounding circumstances, was confirmed in the express terms of the 1986 stipulated judgment which commanded the district and the United States to perform the contract. In particular, the first sentence of paragraph 4.2, which is at joint appendix page 111, states -- and I quote -- the district acknowledges that it entered into the 1963 contract for the benefit of Areas 1A and 1B. That's the premerger --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Smiland, do you mind telling us why the petitioners never filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. There's a long history of litigation here. It began with the first suit in 1979. We were in the district court there. There were administrative and constitutional and equitable issues as well, and we were able in that initial case to combine all those forms of relief in the district court. And then, of course, we got this judgment that I began to read from. And from then on, we had four or five other cases all in the district court. We do acknowledge that on the breach of contract, there is concurrent jurisdiction under the Tucker Act.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it concurrent? I mean, the -- the statute I'm reading, the one you brought is consent is given to join the United States as a necessary party defendant. Is that what happened here? They were joined as a necessary party defendant?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we think so, Your Honor.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They were? I -- I think that's -- isn't that -- what rule of -- I thought there's a -- a Rule of Federal Procedure. I can't remember what -- what's the --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4820 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Rule 19(s)?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4821 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Is that what they were joined under?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that procedure was not invoked here.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. Well, all right. Were they -- there's technical phrase well known in the law to be joined as a necessary party defendant. Given the normal meaning in the law of that technical phrase, is that what happened here?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. What happened -- what happened --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, okay. If it did not happen, then how could you possibly sue in that court rather than the Court of Claims where the statute says you can sue on any implied, as well as express, contract?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4826 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because the waiver of sovereign immunity statute says in any suit.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't mean in any suit in sentence 2 of the kind referred to in sentence 1? Does it mean any suit in the universe? Any suit in the world? Any tort suit? I would have thought that sentence 2 refers to sentence 1.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- it does and that case was litigated against the United States by my clients and -- and we won in the Peck case. And we think that should have ended the matter.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But don't -- how can we, if we have -- if -- if I read this -- this as meaning technically what it says and it's a jurisdictional matter, how could I do anything other than say, go to the Court of Claims, you're in the wrong court?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Any suit is also in the first sentence, Your Honor.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. It says --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in any suit you can join the United States as a necessary party.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the -- in the sue and be sued cases, this Court construes that very broadly, and this is the same root word and --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but we don't give broad construction to waivers of sovereign immunity.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Quite the reverse. And it says to join the U.S. as a necessary party defendant in a suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights of a contracting entity in the United States regarding any contract executed pursuant. Now, I guess the farmers were not technically the contracting entity.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They were not the signing --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- party.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you've got more problems.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our -- our argument -- and again, this has been resolved in the lower courts against the Government. But our -- our view is that by the nature of the intended beneficiary doctrine, the duty is owed to the third party, as well as to the promisee, and it's enforceable by the third party, as well as the promisee.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4843 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you -- if the lower courts were of this view, why did the district court in this case give you three opportunities to have your contract claim transferred to the Claims Court?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4844 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Once the determination was made that we were not intended third party beneficiaries, that was the law of the case, and had it been transferred to the Claims Court, we -- we would have been bound by that determination. We felt we had to bring to a final resolution the -- the intended beneficiary issue before we could proceed in the Claims Court either.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4845 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it does suggest that the district court had at least some concern whether the case -- your claim had been lodged in the right court.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4846 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, although again that -- that court had been hearing these matters for many years in -- in numerous cases without this issue ever having come up.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4847 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but it's a -- see, I want to know what I'm supposed to do. As I read the language, you're out. As I understand the purpose of the statute, it makes sense to me if you're out, and it doesn't make sense to me if you're in. And maybe there's some lower court precedent to the contrary, which I'd certainly read, but is there any Supreme Court precedent to the contrary that supports you?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4848 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Just the -- the language of in any suit definitely is --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4849 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. But that isn't the limiting part. The limiting part is in any suit of a certain kind.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4850 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4851 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What they give consent to is joinder as a necessary party. And that is not what happened here.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4852 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Only the -- the general principle that language should be read in its ordinary meaning --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4853 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's ordinary meaning, you're out because the ordinary meaning of joinder as a necessary party is you weren't joined as a --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4854 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There -- there at least is no evidence that Congress had rule 19 in mind when it enacted either the '52 statute or the '82 statute that we -- we stand on.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4855 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's something that I hadn't concentrated on before now, but your position that, well, if you're transferred to the Court -- to the Court of Claims, that you bring with you all of the previous rulings of the United States district court in California and that those are somehow binding because of the law of the case -- what is the authority for that? The -- the court that's transferred has to accept all the rulings that have been made previous to the transfer?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4856 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- our understanding is if, obviously --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4857 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, what's the authority for that?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4858 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I can't cite you authority, Your Honor, but I -- we were very concerned about that. If there was no waiver of sovereign immunity in the first instance, then the lower court's ruling on intended third party beneficiary I would think should be vacated.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4859 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could I -- I -- I guess I'm not following this. I don't know why, Mr. Smiland, you -- you have not referred to the last sentence of -- of what you assert was the waiver of sovereign immunity, which says any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States district court in the State in which the land involved is situated. Why isn't that what you're relying on?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4860 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is and -- and when I was talking about in any suit --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4861 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How does that help you? Because it says any suit pursuant to this section, and of course, this section starts off by talking about addition of a person as a necessary party. So how does the last sentence help you?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4862 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4863 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- it -- if the words, join necessary, limit any suit and the language that Justice Scalia referred to, then -- then maybe we're in trouble. But otherwise --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4864 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I take that to mean that when you sue one defendant and you also sue the United States as a necessary party defendant, that suit -- any -- that would be a suit pursuant to this section. I -- I don't know what other meaning that -- that sentence could have. When you sue two parties, one of whom is the United States, by reason of the fact that it's a necessary party defendant, that suit is a suit pursuant this section and it can be brought in any United States district court in the State in which the land involved is situated. I -- I don't know what -- what other suit that -- that sentence could refer to.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4865 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You -- you agree with that. I -- you're caught in between us here, and I understand. (Laughter.)
03-1566 +++$+++ 4866 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I guess we have to figure out what is the right meaning of that initial phrase.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4867 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Perhaps you can explain. This was not your suit originally. You intervened. Right? This was started out by the water district.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4868 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The district sued the United States. We intervened.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4869 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And then after some, I think, 2 years --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4870 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4871 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the water district bows out. It has settled its case. It's a mystery what it settled for. At least, I didn't see it in any of the briefs. Why did the water district, having brought this case, then say, we're satisfied, we're out?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4872 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The record is very sparse, Your Honor. There is the district's motion which says pretty much what it said in its brief, that there was a -- a thing called the principles between it and the United States and various parties. And as a result of those principles, which are not in the record, although they are a matter of public record, the -- the district in its discretion elected to dismiss the case. We opposed that. We would have hoped the district would have kept going. We lost that opposition. The district was dismissed, and we were allowed to proceed on our own.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4873 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Smiland, can I ask this question? If Justice Breyer is -- the thrust of his question is right, I -- I think the district itself could not have brought the suit under his reading of the sovereign immunity. And I'm just wondering, has the United States ever taken the position that the district could not have initiated this litigation?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4874 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not to my knowledge, Your Honor.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4875 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could -- could we hear your argument on -- on the sovereign immunity point as opposed to the venue point? What -- on what ground do you say the United States has waived its -- its immunity from suit in this case?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4876 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There are two statutes.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4877 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May -- may we just back up to the question -- your answer to Justice Stevens? I thought that this wasn't a suit initially on the part of the water district for money damages. I thought they were seeking declaratory relief against the United States.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4878 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They pled both, Your Honor. Although at that time the water still was available for delivery, it hadn't flowed to the ocean. And the money had not yet been collected and spent. So the focus initially was on equitable relief to stop --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4879 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because one could -- one could read the words, suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights, as a suit for declaratory relief but not encompassing damages.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4880 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Both statutes we cite say that judgments can be entered in the same manner, to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, language I believe from the Federal Tort Claims Act. Again, both in the 491 F.Supp. decision under the McCarran Act and in the Peck case, the district court held that money damages were encompassed by that. So both statute -- statutes on which we rely have language in it taken from other sources of law, with which this Court is very familiar and has opined on several times. The -- the only unique parts of -- of either of the two statutes that we stand on are -- are the rights. One refers to administering a previously adjudicated right to the use of water, and the other is the contract language we've discussed.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4881 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can you turn to sovereign immunity now?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4882 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4883 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and let me make -- make it easy for you. Do you know of any case, other than cases decided by this friendly district judge, in which a suit has been allowed against the United States based on nothing more than the status as a third party beneficiary of a contract to which the United States has -- on which the United States has agreed to be sued? Is -- is there any such case?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4884 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4885 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and you think it's clear that -- as our sovereign immunity law requires, that such a third party beneficiary can sue the United States?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4886 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ For example, in the U.S. v. District Court case decided by this Court in 1971, under the McCarran Act, that fact situation was not before you, but the Court did say that the rights to which the statute referred were all inclusive. It read it broadly.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4887 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I don't understand that. The rights were all inclusive. As -- as I understand the law of third party beneficiaries, it -- it used to be -- and -- and perhaps at the time this statute was enacted still was -- quite -- quite restrictive. It's only in more recent -- I don't agree with the Government's argument that -- that you have to, in an ordinary contract, explicitly refer to the third party beneficiary's rights. But when sovereign immunity is at issue, it's -- it's a different question, it seems to me.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4888 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we have explicit rights here and -- and it would seem to me that if -- if -- and this was certainly the legislative history behind section 221, not -- not behind McCarran. But if -- if the same duty is owed by the promisor to the third party that it owes to the promisee, and if the third party has the same rights of enforcement as it does under 304 of the Restatement that the promisee would have, why should it be any different? Why would Congress have intended to exclude that? And it used the word contract.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4889 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because -- because we have a rule that says when Congress wants the United States to be sued, it -- it must say so clearly.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4890 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You also have the rule that the word contract means the law of contract and not parts of it.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4891 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But yes, isn't it arguable, though, that in this case the Government probably thought that it would be efficient to have the district represent all the farmers for whatever their -- to the extent their interests were shared with one another, rather than having every individual have the same right to bring -- bring a lawsuit?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4892 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Efficient in -- in collecting land assessments and water charges, but there's no evidence in the -- either the language of the statute, I submit, or the --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4893 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Except for the fact that the district is the party to the contract, though.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4894 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Nothing was said about litigation, let alone intended third party beneficiary --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4895 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but the -- the whole point of the district -- correct if I'm wrong. This is your area. The whole point of the district was to make it easier for the United States to know with whom it was dealing to have an efficient system, and if you say, well, that doesn't include lawsuits for damages, it seems to me that destroys much of the purpose of the formation of the district.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4896 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's a lot of legislative history there, and it talks a great deal, as you say, Your Honor, about efficiency and -- and the convenience. But it's not talking at all about litigation, about remedies, about rights once there's a breach.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4897 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you haven't really achieved very much efficiency if you simply get the United States out of the business of collecting the payments and of keeping track of the payments but leave the United States subject to suit when the person who has authority to do -- do these things goofs. I mean, what -- what trouble has the United States saved itself? It would still have to ride herd over -- over the person with -- with whom it's dealing.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4898 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- this is a transaction between a water seller and many water buyers. Yes, in 1926 districts were put in the middle, but it's also true in 1939 in -- in the section 9(e), Congress authorized the particular type of contracts we have here, so-called water service contracts, and it doesn't mention district. And as a matter of fact, the Ninth Circuit has held that the bureau had the discretion administratively to deal with individuals. So throughout the history of the reclamation program, you -- you have the -- the core transaction is -- is a water sale from the Government to -- to farmers. And that's was the case on day one in 1902 and it still is. And I'd just like to remind the Court that paragraph 3 of the stipulated judgment at page 110 of the joint appendix is in our view dispositive here. This was a -- an agreement by the United States and the district, approved by a court after formal settlement notice was dispatched to two formal classes, and it says, any appropriate relief may be obtained against the Federal parties by the filing of a new action for violation of any contract arising independently of this judgment.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4899 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the -- the Justice Department has no authority to -- to consent to suit which -- which Congress has not consented to. I don't see how this strengthens your case.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4900 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Again, if -- if this Court should hold that neither of the two statutes on -- on which we stand waive sovereign immunity, and --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4901 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And this alone wouldn't -- wouldn't remedy the --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4902 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then -- then --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4903 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the absence --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4904 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the decision that we're not intended beneficiaries should be vacated and we should have a chance to go to the court -- Claims Court. I'd like to reserve, Your Honor, 3 minutes, if I may.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4905 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You may, indeed, Mr. Smiland. Mr. Minear, I think you're up next.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4907 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Petitioners cannot maintain this suit for breach of the Westlands contract because the Westlands contract is itself subject to the rules of sovereign immunity. And section 390uu authorizes only a limited waiver of sovereign immunity. It does not authorize suits by incidental beneficiaries for money damages. For many of the points that have already been raised by Justice Breyer, Justice Kennedy --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4908 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Minear, do you think it does waive sovereign immunity for suits brought by the district?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4909 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In one circumstance, Your Honor. This suit allows a district that has been sued by individual water users to join the United States in the ongoing suit and, in fact, remove the case to Federal court if necessary, so there can be a determination of all the rights in those --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4910 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did this suit begin as a suit by a water user against the district and then you were joined later? Is that --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4911 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it did not, but that did occur in the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation that ran between 1978 and 1980.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4912 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, in this suit, did not the district bring it against the United States?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4913 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4914 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And was that a -- was that jurisdiction proper at that time?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4915 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That suit was brought under the APA, and the district brought the suit on that basis.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4916 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But was it properly brought is what I'm asking you.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4917 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That suit was properly brought.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4918 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4919 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it was not brought under 390uu. Instead, there was an allegation that the United States had acted unlawfully and the Westlands relied on the Administrative Procedure Act.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4920 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And no money damages.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4921 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And no money damages as well, and that's what distinguishes this case.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4922 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So that -- so your view -- I mean, what -- what makes sense to me is that the section means what it says, that consent is given to join the United States. That means join them in an ongoing suit. And it makes sense because what the United States wants is anyone who sues them for money damages goes to the Court of Claims. But of course, where you have an ongoing suit between two other people, we'll make an exception because there it's already in another district and we'll let you bring the United States in as a necessary party. The other exception is when you don't sue for money damages. That's in section 702 of the APA. Now, that to me makes a lot of sense and it's consistent with the language. Is that your view or do you have a different view?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4923 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, that is our view, and let me supplement your comments in this regard. Section --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4924 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I -- may I -- has that always been your view throughout? (Laughter.)
03-1566 +++$+++ 4925 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It has been our view under 390uu when section 390uu has been -- has been raised.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4926 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But throughout the litigation?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4927 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Throughout this litigation? I can't -- I can't be sure that we've maintained a consistent position, but ultimately this is a question of sovereign immunity. So the importance is that we get the issue right here.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4928 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There has to be an ongoing suit. You think this section does -- does not permit somebody to initiate suit against one party and at the same time against the United States as a necessary party.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4929 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, let me explain why that's the case, and there was an answer --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4930 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why what is the case?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4935 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The language could be construed to allow that, but -- but waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly, and the language I think is more properly construed, as Justice Breyer has suggested, to allow joinder as a necessary party. And in fact, it was enacted in specific reaction to that problem in the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation where we did have ongoing litigation and there was a sense by the irrigation district they needed to join the United States so they would not be subject to inconsistent suits. So although I think that the language can bear the -- the interpretation that you're suggesting, Justice Scalia, nevertheless, I think the better interpretation is the more narrow one that is --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4936 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then -- then how do you explain the last -- the last sentence of that provision, which is any suit pursuant to this section? The only suit that the section refers to is a suit in which the United States is joined as a necessary party defendant. That's the subject of the section.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4937 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, and --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4938 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and the last sentence says, any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States district court. And I read that to mean if you want to sue the United States as a necessary party initiating a suit, you can bring it in -- in any district court in which the land involved is.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4939 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, we read that as allowing removal in those circumstances when the United States is joined later. In any event, I have to say that with regard to -- to this disagreement, it does -- it's not dispositive or even affect the case here. The fact is that this waiver of sovereign immunity under no circumstances would allow this suit to go forward. Apart from the money damages aspect, which itself is -- is -- would preclude this type of suit, these parties are not intended beneficiaries, and without being intended beneficiaries, there's -- in no circumstances could they ever evoke these provisions.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4940 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Minear, when you say -- when you say not money damages, do you read the words that I read to Mr. Smiland restrictively or do you think they accommodate money damages, that is, suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights of a contracting entity?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4941 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We think that under your cases, such as Pena v. Lane, there needs to be a specific reference to money damages. This simply is referencing declaratory relief, and so we do not believe it would allow an award of money damages. Rather, the party must go to the Claims Court if they're seeking money damages. And in fact, the waiver of sovereign immunity there is somewhat broader. It does, as mentioned before, allow implied or express contracts. So this suit is simply in the wrong court. But I would like to --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4942 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So money damages -- waiver always used the word money damages. When it says adjudicate the rights under the contract, that doesn't include money damages?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4943 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I do not think in this context it would. I think there needs to be something more specific. We're really talking about declaring rights here and not providing a specific remedy. And this Court has always taken the view that the Claims Court jurisdiction is the appropriate forum for deciding money damages.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4944 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What about the second sentence?The United States, when a party, shall be deemed to have waived any right to plead that it is not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty and shall be subject to judgments, orders, and decrees of the court having jurisdiction and may obtain review thereof in the same manner and to the same extent? It's subject to the judgments, orders, and decrees of the court to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances. Why isn't that enough to -- to say that the court can -- can award damages?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4945 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I think that simply refers back to the previous sentence, which refers to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree. Now, if you interpret that to include money damages, then the second sentence would follow, but I -- I think the two have to be construed together. And in our view simply allowing a party to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree in these circumstances would not allow award of money damages. Certainly I think Congress would be much clearer.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4946 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but if contractual rights include a right to be paid for something, why wouldn't you get a money judgment in a case like that? That first sentence certainly covers the possibility of a contractual right to be paid something.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4947 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, again, waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly. Now, let's --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4948 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's pretty clear language.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4949 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- I have to say that the language -- you're saying that the language -- yes, could it conceivably be -- be interpreted in -- on -- that broadly. But that's not --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4950 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Certainly if it were not a -- a United States and were a private individual, it would include money damages.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4951 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That might well be, but this is --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4952 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and the next sentence, as Justice Scalia points out, says the United States shall be treated just like a private party.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4953 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. But Your Honor, ultimately I think that we have to focus on that this is a waiver of sovereign immunity. And -- and so far we have not touched on the question of whether these parties --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4954 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think you've got a very strong argument when you talk about an incidental third party beneficiary not being a contracting party, but now you're asking for a much broader holding than really necessary to dispose of this case, it seems to me.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4955 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I think I started with that point, that an incidental beneficiary cannot invoke this -- this provision. And I'd like to -- to continue with that point because the party here is merely an incidental beneficiary and not an intended beneficiary. Under any of the -- the tests that have been applied for third party beneficiaries, the party here would not qualify as an intended beneficiary. Most importantly, the contracting parties here, the United States and Westlands, expressed no intent to give this party enforcement rights. What's more, the contract does not provide that performance would be rendered to -- to the petitioners in this case. The contract is quite clear that performance is rendered to Westlands. This is a contract in which the United States furnishes a specified amount of water to Westlands and Westlands pays money for it. Westlands then has a separate obligation with regard to the farmers.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4956 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Separate from -- where does that -- that obligation come from?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4957 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That arises from the regulations that the Westlands Water District has enacted that provides for the delivery of water from Westlands to the individual farmers. The United States' obligation --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4958 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a State -- a State created obligation?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4959 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. That is -- and Westlands has the -- has the option of either engaging in contracts with the individual farmers or distributing the water through regulation, and it has opted for regulations. Now, Westlands itself is a governmental unit. It is comprised of the -- of the very farmers here, among others, who have brought this suit. And it has the authority to act in a representative capacity on behalf of all its members. And that is why the United States enters into contracts with irrigation districts precisely because it allows them to reach accord and agreement and to resolve their disputes. Now, the fact is that the United States and Westlands agree on a great many things. Sometimes they disagree, but when we disagree, we're able to -- to speak to one another as two governments representing constituencies and hammer out our differences. And that would be impossible if these types of third party beneficiary suits were allowed. And I think that goes to the crux of what the United States' real concern here is. When there are contracts between one government and another, just as in the context of treaties or compacts among the States, it's vital that the two governmental units be able to deal with one another as governments and to be assured that if they can reach accord on behalf of their representatives -- on behalf of the parties they represent, that that will resolve the issue. If it were otherwise, this type of distribution of water --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4960 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you don't take the position, do you, that Westlands could have agreed with the United States that it wouldn't enforce its new laws that deprived the farmers of water? You don't take that position.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4961 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But let's look at what would happen, Your Honor, if that did happen. The individual farmers would sue Westlands, claiming that Westlands was not living up to its contract obligations. Westlands would invoke 390uu and join the United States in that suit. And the question of the legal rights would be determined on that basis. So the mechanism that -- that we've specified and the way that we interpret it deals precisely with the problem that you've -- you've addressed.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4962 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but you can't -- the -- presumably the Federal Government can't negotiate away the Endangered Species Act or something. The fact is that new laws were passed after these contracts were entered into with Westlands. Isn't that right?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4963 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. And again, I think it's instructive to see what happened in this case. When those laws were enacted, the United States reacted to those. Westlands brought a suit under the APA challenging the interpretation of the statutes. Westlands was entitled to do that under the APA. The United States and Westlands reached an accord, together with the environmental intervenors in this group, that was satisfactory to those parties. And it simply would be very disruptive of the system if a minority of farmers in the Westlands District could then bring a suit and upset that agreement and that accord that had been reached. Finally, I'd like to make a brief --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4964 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can the district get damages from the Government?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4965 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Technically yes, but their damages are limited by the terms of the contract. Westlands could sue the United States in Claims Court for a breach of the contract, but the contract itself says that any damages that are -- that the sole liability of the United States in these circumstances would be an adjustment of the account. In other words, there are not consequential damages. Rather, if we do not provide Westlands with the water that Westlands believes it's entitled to, then we stand liable for an adjustment in the payments that Westlands would make to us. The suit that is being brought here is asking for consequential damages, and we believe that the contract here does not allow consequential damages. That, of course, is a merits question that there's no need for the Court to reach, but that is the way it would be resolved in Claims Court in -- in our view. I'd like to also raise the question of property rights since that has -- has come up, that one of the arguments that has been made by Westlands is that they're entitled to status of a third party beneficiary because they claim they have water rights in these circumstances. The fact is that the United States, the State of California, and Westlands, as well as the California Water Resources Board and the first tier of California courts, have all concluded they do not have the -- the water rights that they claim. But in any event, our view is that that issue is irrelevant to the inquiry here. Rather, the question of third party beneficiary status turns on the intent of the contracting parties. Did they or did they not intend to give enforceable rights to the third party? Here there's not a shred of evidence that that was an intent -- there was an intent to create enforceable rights in that third party. Quite to the contrary. The only reference of third parties, the farmers, in the contract here is directed to limitations on what the district can do once it receives its water. It doesn't create rights in them -- the individual farmers. Quite to the contrary. What it does it restricts the ability of the district in order to protect the United States' interests, to make sure the United States will be paid for the water that it ultimately provides to the district. The central point that I would like to leave you with, though, here at the end is the importance of protecting the relationship between the United States and Westlands. But although we disagree on some matters, we are able to reach accommodation and agreement, and when we're able to do that, it's to the good of all concerned. The contracts and the laws here are structured to allow those types of agreements to be reached, and we think that allowing third party beneficiary suits would be very disruptive of that -- that operation.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4966 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Minear. Mr. Somach, will you tell us what the district's views on this whole matter are?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4968 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Westlands Water District has argued in its brief that petitioners are not intended third party beneficiaries with enforceable rights under the 1963 contract. I want to make two points from the perspective of the district why this must be so. First, allowing a direct right of action by petitioners is not practical or consistent with the district's need and ability to function as a governmental entity and to allocate all of the water that it receives under contract to all of the landowners within the -- the district. This is a scarce and valuable resource, and these types of third party lawsuits jeopardize the district's ability to be able to provide water pursuant to California Water Code provisions to all of the landowners within the district. Second, the laws of the State of California and reclamation law, working in harmony one with the other --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4969 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Excuse me. Could you expand on the first point a little bit? I mean, you say you don't want to be bothered with lawsuits. Is -- is that -- is that all that it amounts to?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4970 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I -- I think quite on the contrary. You know, and unfortunately, the -- the history of this contract and these -- these issues has been anything other than the district avoiding litigation. The -- the whole concept of a water district is not to individualize or incrementalize the water and interests in water in any one group of landowners or any one landowner. The idea is that the rights of all of the landowners to all of the water under the contract are to be treated as a whole and allow the district to provide protection to all of the landowners within the district as a whole, the point there being that the water doesn't belong to any one landowner or a group of landowners. It belongs to the whole. And in fact, the way the district operates, the way it has to operate is in the context of the whole. Bonds are issued. Encumbrances on lands are -- are incurred, all based upon not individual rights to water but rather broad rights of water throughout the district. To allow a small group of landowners to decide how to administer the contract, how to enforce the contract in any one given situation leaves decisions that are critical to all of the landowners solely in the hands of an unaccountable small group of -- of landowners.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4971 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can't -- can't such a suit be brought in State court? I can't believe that this district can do whatever it wants with the water.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4972 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, absolutely not. Yes, it -- yes, it can.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4973 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Really?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4974 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. What I meant to say was yes, you are right.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4975 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4976 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And absolutely not. It can't do just anything it wants to do. It is subject, as a governmental entity, to all the strict requirements of California water law and governmental law, for that matter. If, for example, these petitioners decide for whatever reason they don't like a decision of the -- of the board -- and in fact, that is an example that exists emanating out of the facts of this case. When the district decided that it was better to settle the litigation, these landowners first petitioned the -- the governing of the -- of the district and sought to -- to have them not proceed in that manner, the way any other group of citizens or constituents with any other governmental entity would have proceeded. The district decided, however, that it was in the best interests of all of the landowners within the district to settle the litigation. Now, at that point in time certainly, these petitioners had the normal and ordinary rights that any -- any constituent within the district has to be able to challenge a decision that has been made by the district. That includes, for example, writ proceedings, to argue that the decision of the board was arbitrary, capricious, otherwise unlawful, and that it should -- should be mandated to -- to proceed in some other fashion. If the issue were damages, this district is subject, like any other governmental entity within the State of California, to the government Tort Claims Act if -- if they're tortious type damages. And if we have arguable impairment of property rights, this district is subject to the California constitution, the United States Constitution, and the government code provisions that provide for litigation with respect to those broader types of -- of damages. And quite frankly, this is a governmental body and it is very susceptible to the political process. It is not an easy thing for -- for the district to be standing up here and telling you that its landowners aren't entitled to receive what they want. That's a very difficult for the district to -- to do. But in dealing with the rights of the entire district, it's an absolute essential thing to do. If these landowners had exercised their prerogatives under California law, they could have, assuming they were the majority, controlled the decisions of the board of directors in the way that any majority constituency controls the director -- the -- the direction and the decisions of a -- of a governing board. You know, this -- this lawsuit is instructive in -- in a number of ways in terms of these practical concerns that we have in terms of how in the world are we going to be able to administer a contract like this one. How are we going to do all of the things that the Water Code has told us that we have to do if, at any given time, a landowner, a small group of landowners is able to go into Federal district court and independently decide that it wants to administer the contract that the district has with the United States or to enforce terms of the contract that it has with the United States in a manner that's inconsistent or different than the way --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4977 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't really understand why that's any greater burden than the fact they can sue you in State court anyway. They -- they can always bring litigation.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4978 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it -- it really requires the district to, in a sense, race to the courthouse with the -- with the petitioners in order to be there first in order to have its views of the contract --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4979 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the suit in State court, I assume, would -- would only be -- the claim would be that you were acting arbitrarily, and so long as your interpretation of the contract was a reasonable one, the suit would fail.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4980 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4981 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Whereas, this suit here -- it doesn't matter how reasonable it is. If it's wrong, it's wrong. I mean, it's quite a different --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4982 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I think it is a different situation, and I agree with what you -- what you have said, Your Honor. I do, however, want to -- to not avoid the concern that may be expressed here, and -- and that is, that -- that what it does is it -- it forces the district into a situation of chasing its landowners, in essence, around from one litigation forum to another in order to ensure that its means of controlling and -- and administering the contract is not jeopardized. The fact that the landowners -- if the landowners can move forward independently with litigation with respect to the contract, what it really does is create in a sense a -- the contract becomes this very interesting moving target where the district has its views about what the contract is and how it should be administered, how it should be enforced, and then it proceeds in one direction as, for example, it did with the settlement in this litigation, deciding that that was the best way to protect the interests of the district. Had these petitioners on the merits in a hypothetical situation prevailed with a totally different result, that would have substantially affected and impacted the district's ability to be able to maintain the obligations and the commitments that it made to the other settling parties. That destabilizes the ability of the district to actually act in other governmental forums, in forums with the United States, with the State of California, with other districts in the context of attempting to say we control the contract, we enforce its terms, and we can make commitments. And when we make those commitments, we can abide by and we can live up to those commitments in a way that -- that governments ought to be able to do when they're -- when they're making those types of commitments. Having the landowners being able to come or -- and here, I want to make certain. When I use the word landowners, I'm not saying that the landowners are not beneficiaries of the contract. They certainly are.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4983 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What about the provision in the judgment at page 110 that was -- that was cited to us, that -- that the parties may obtain other appropriate relief by the filing of a new action?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4984 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I -- I think that that -- that phrase is actually begun as a proviso, and I view it as not limiting the ability of the area I landowners in the Barcellos & Wolfsen judgment that you're -- that you're quoting from from being able to act in any other way. It was a non-limiting provision. The -- the first part of the -- the part that you read deals with what their rights to enforce were. The second part was a proviso that simply said notwithstanding this, whatever else you're able to do, you may do. Thank you for your time.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4985 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Somach. Mr. Smiland, you have 9 minutes remaining, but you do not have to use it all.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4987 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Your Honor. What happened here is that the United States sold half the water it was obligated to sell under the contract. It doubled the price it was permitted to charge on the other half. It was a massive harm to the farmers. I'm sure you understand.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4988 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you say under the contract. I thought there was a provision in the contract that said that the United States will not be responsible for under-deliveries, and I think it listed the drought and the last thing was any other cause.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4989 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's what we were about to go to trial on, Your Honor. That's a merits issue. The Ninth Circuit has abstained on whether there was a mandatory statutory duty to cut off this water, and I urge the Court not to -- to dive into that pool. We're trying to get in the courthouse doors.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4990 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you were saying there's -- there's a right under this contract to recover from the United States for an under-delivery.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4991 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We have massive cross summary judgment motions on that issue and we were entitled to go to trial on that -- on our claim of liability.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4992 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4993 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4994 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, please.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4995 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I've asked a lot of questions. Go on.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4996 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What do you make -- excuse me. What do you make of the argument for reasonable construction of the contract that in fact you just simply cannot have a system that would promise the chaos that -- that you are promising?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4997 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I don't make much of it. The parties here and -- and the parties in the West fully understood for 20 years, after Allen Orchards, that the farmers were intended third party beneficiaries. That's -- we settled in 1986 with that understanding, and this parade of horribles just has not come to pass.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4998 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is -- is it correct, as Justice Scalia suggested earlier, that so far as State litigation is concerned, it would be limited simply to arbitrary, unreasonable behavior?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4999 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true. And even more fundamentally, the United States breached the contract. The district didn't do anything wrong. Why would we sue the district when the United States cut off the water and doubled the charge?
03-1566 +++$+++ 5000 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think it's arbitrary not to -- not to -- for an agency, of which you're -- you're in some sense at least the beneficiary, not to insist upon its contract rights, just as a shareholder can insist that the -- that a corporation enforce its contracts.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5001 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We had a little mini-trial on that in front of the -- in front of the district court, and -- and I made that argument, Your Honor, and the district court rejected it.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5002 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, he was wrong. That was -- (Laughter.)
03-1566 +++$+++ 5003 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I agree.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5004 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I guess the reason that you would sue the district would be if you didn't have any enforceable promise from the United States that they didn't -- wouldn't do it.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5005 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we -- we --
03-1566 +++$+++ 5006 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, you think you do. That's the issue in the case.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5007 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We had a stipulated judgment.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5008 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And so therefore -- therefore, I'm looking for where that promise is. And you started out by citing a page, which wasn't a page of the contract. It was a page of some kind of settlement, and that page said that the district agrees that they entered into the contract with helping the farmers in mind. I'm sure they did. So what. I mean, I might buy a house with the idea of helping of my child. I'm going to give it to him. That doesn't mean he can enforce the contract.

03-1566 +++$+++ 5010 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You mean my child can enforce a contract I enter into with another -- I buy a house and I say I intend to give it to my daughter.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5011 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the contract --
03-1566 +++$+++ 5012 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And then she can enforce the contract?
03-1566 +++$+++ 5013 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the contract says --
03-1566 +++$+++ 5014 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. If the contract says. Now, that's why I was interested that you didn't cite language in the contract.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5015 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes, we did, Your Honor.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5016 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You -- well, I mean, you started out by referring me to page 110 or 111 --
03-1566 +++$+++ 5017 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5018 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- which doesn't. Now, what is the language in the contract --
03-1566 +++$+++ 5019 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Articles --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5029 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Mr. Lamken, it's not as comprehensive as other schemes where the Court said, on that basis, we would not find a section 1983 cause of action, is it? I mean, it's -- it's more spare.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5030 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it is unusual in its unique focus on private enforcement, but there was a reason for the focus on private enforcement. In other provisions of the Communications Act, the Congress chose -- for example, section 253, Congress chose to eliminate enforcement at -- at the FCC level because it was concerned that State and local governments often wouldn't have enough -- excuse me -- local governments in particular --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5031 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what -- what --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5032 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- wouldn't be able to -- I'm sorry.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5033 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What would you think of a case where the plaintiff alleges that the antenna zoning was the -- was caused by racial discrimination against the applicant? Would there be a 1983 cause of action, do you suppose?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5034 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. That would still be available because the -- the section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) only provides for a cause of action for violations of the Communications Act. Violations of the Constitution continue to be enforceable directly under section 1983. Section -- section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) is comprehensive in the relevant sense in that for every violation of section 332(c)(7), for every person adversely aggrieved, it provides a mechanism for private judicial enforcement. In addition --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5035 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what about -- it -- it -- section 332 speaks of an award of all appropriate relief. What does that include? Could it include punitive damages? Could it include attorney's fees, do you think?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5036 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In that respect, it is indistinguishable -- for example, the statute that was at issue in Smith v. Robinson, and it doesn't specify the precise forms of relief available. In our view in this case, appropriate relief would mean specific relief, the type of relief that is traditionally given on review of zoning decisions and on review of judicial review of agency action. That's supported by a number of considerations. I should point out, in the first instance, that in this case respondent never did seek damages, or punitive damages for that matter, under section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself. But that's supported by a number of considerations. First is the structure of the act, which presents it as a form of judicial review of agency action. The act is structured much as you have -- much as you would when a Federal agency enforces or implements Federal requirements and are subject to judicial review. The only difference is that Congress swapped in, effectively, State and local agencies with the initial implementers in place of the Federal Government. In that respect, it shares some of the characteristics of sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act which are also implemented by local -- by -- excuse me -- by State governments as opposed to the FCC.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5037 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. -- Mr. Lamken, the argument has been made that 4 years before the telecommunications act we're talking about was adopted, Congress adopted the Cable TV Consumer Protection Act. And in that act, it specifically limited the remedies to declaratory and injunctive relief. Here we face silence. Isn't that an indication that when Congress wants to limit relief to declaratory and injunctive, it will say so in the -- in the measure?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5038 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, that -- that's an example where Congress, for a broad range of statutes that could be potentially used to enforce the Cable Act, chose to restrict the forms of relief available. And it is an example, in the words of Sea Clammers, where Congress has made its intent explicit in the text of the statute. Congress can also by implication limit the forms of -- excuse me -- limit the mechanism for relief that's available, and that's our position here, that Congress by providing --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5039 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What's the -- what's the source of the implication?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5040 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Pardon?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5041 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You say by implication.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5042 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The implication -- Congress has provided a specific mechanism for judicial relief here, section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself, and that is a highly adapted mechanism which includes unique characteristics such as a very short limitations period.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5043 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so the -- the implication, I -- I guess, is that unless it specifically provides for damages, it implicitly does not.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5044 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry. In terms of Congress making damages available under 332(c)(7)(B)(v), our view of the damage -- mind you damages are only one of the differences we think that exists here, but our view is supported by a number of considerations, in addition to the structure of the statute. For example, appropriate relief is often -- is the traditional form of relief available. In this context traditional relief was always specific relief. Congress also included a specific savings clause that extends not merely to Federal statutes, but prohibits the impairment --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5045 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Excuse me. Where -- where are you getting the term, appropriate relief, from?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5046 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This -- that comes from this Court's decision in Franklin, that where Congress doesn't specifically identify the specific forms of relief available --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5047 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. But that's -- that's not in the -- that's not in the text of this statute, is it?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5048 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, it isn't. It is an inference the Court draws from silence. When the Court -- when Congress provides an express cause of action and does not identify the specific forms of relief available, the Court will infer that Congress intended to provide all appropriate relief. But the term, appropriate relief, is that relief which Congress would have intended, and when the Court is determining that, it takes a look at what the traditional forms of relief are and it will look at things such as the savings clause in 601(c), which expressly says that the statute should not be read, unless it expressly provides, to supersede, impair, or otherwise modify State and local law, as well as Federal law. And in order to put damages into the statute, if it doesn't provide damages expressly, one would have to impair myriad municipal immunity laws that otherwise protect municipalities and State and local officers implementing zoning requirements from liability. Finally, the FCC has --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5049 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and 1983 is not subject to that limitation.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5050 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, 1983 is expressly preemptive under this Court's decisions, and it is -- it would preempt the State laws by its own force. But we believe that that also supports Congress' decision not to provide -- or supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend to provide section 1983 relief here because the effect of making the Communications Act enforceable under section 1983 would be to expand the categories of claims for which -- that -- those immunities are unavailable, and it would thereby impair those immunities.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5051 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But are they only immune from damages action or are they immune from suit?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5052 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. They're generally immunities -- immune from damages actions, not from suits.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5053 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So, I mean, that proves too much because they -- the statute obviously intends to eliminate that immunity. The immunity from suit is -- is clearly --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5054 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, I think -- I think you may have misunderstood. The immunity is not from suit. It's an immunity from damages and the impairment would be the immunity from damages. Section 332 is not designed to impair the municipal immunity statutes, and they are not immunities from suit. They are generally from damage liability. The officers are subject to suit because these are subject --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5055 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it allows suit against either municipalities or States, State or local governments. Right?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5056 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5057 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the States have immunity not just from damages but from suit.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5058 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As a constitutional matter, they have an immunity from suit, but --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5059 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Unless they have chosen to waive it, which --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5060 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5061 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- one must assume in this area they haven't.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5062 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5063 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you have to regard this provision as intentionally overriding some provisions of State law in -- inasmuch as they apply to -- to immunity.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5064 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, first of all, I don't think it would be read to -- to override the State's constitutional immunity to suit.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5065 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. That's --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5066 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it would be read to -- it would be read to override immunities to suit that exist under State law because otherwise it couldn't be affected.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5067 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In for a penny, in for a pound.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5068 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5069 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If they've -- if they've waived --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5070 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I'm not --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5071 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If -- if you acknowledge that it was intended to affect their immunity from suit, why -- why would we suspect that it was not intended to affect their immunity from damages?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5072 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, because it would be -- it would be a provision with no effect whatsoever if it didn't override immunities to suit. But I'm not sure there are provisions that are providing for -- I mean, that there are myriad damages immunity laws that provide municipalities absolute immunity from suit. It's fairly common, at least under California and other State law, for municipalities to be subject to suit for review of their -- of the actions that they make. And that is the typical fashion that this -- this statute simply incorporated that typical fashion of providing judicial review of agency action. Another consideration that supports the view that section 1983 has been displaced is that the act provides an entire process for the implementation of the Federal statutes. It establishes Federal substantive requirements that identifies the agencies to implement them. It provides Federal procedural guarantees, APA-like guarantees, like the requirement of substantial evidence, like the requirement of a written decision, like the requirement of a decision with a reasonable period of time. It then follows up with a mechanism, an adapted mechanism for judicial review. In that sense, it is very much like the statute at issue in Smith v. Robinson. That elaborate process is particularly significant given the pattern of the Communications Act as a whole. The Communications Act repeatedly matches specific regulatory requirements such as, for example, the common carrier requirements in 202 and 203, with corresponding mechanisms for private enforcement, such as an action for suit -- I mean, an action for damages in court or an enforcement action in the commission in sections 206 and 207.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5073 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does this action have to be brought in Federal court? It says any court of competent jurisdiction. Could --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5074 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. The action can be brought in State court and often is. There are about 50 reported decisions that we have found where the suit has been brought in State court. I haven't seen a particular pattern between the choice, but Congress gave the option.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5075 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would a State court be free to award damages or would that be preempted under the view you take of the statute?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5076 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The State -- because there's an express preservation of State law in this context, I think that State -- States would be free to award damages under their own laws. They wouldn't -- whatever relief is available under the Federal statute would be available under the available under the Federal statute, and State courts wouldn't be free to second-guess Congress' judgment as to what relief should be provided under Federal statute.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5077 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the State court allowed damages -- if -- if the State system allowed -- State law allowed damages, would the Federal court, in an action under this section, be allowed to award damages under that -- under the State statute?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5078 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I think since the -- the provision, the savings clause, says that the statute should not be construed to impair State law -- and there are so many municipal immunity statutes and you would only have one construction of the statute -- I believe that the construction would be an across-the-boards construction, that this act does not provide damages and you would not vary from State to State.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5079 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What if the State law authorized the recovery of attorney's fees? Would they be recoverable?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5080 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Pardon?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5081 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What if the State law authorized the recovery of attorney's fees?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5082 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5083 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What would you do then?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5084 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the State law provides for recovery of attorney's fees for State violations, then that would control for State violations. For violations of Federal law, the -- the remedies that Congress chose to provide would control and the States would not be permitted to second-guess the -- the remedies --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5085 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not sure why that would be if you, in fact, see the statute as trying to impose an APA-like structure, saying to the States, you decide the substance, we'll give you minimum elements of form, which helps your position. Then if the minimum elements of form are not specifically stated in the statute, there's no reason to interfere with the States. Let them do what they want. Only those minimum elements are what you can't do. That works perfectly for you.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5086 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5087 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's strongly supported in the history. It may lose your client the money. I don't know.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5088 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in fact, California provides a municipal immunity for permitting decisions, and so my client --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5089 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So then you're only --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5090 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- would be fine with your position. But that is a potential inference. My -- the normal view would be that where Congress provides a -- a statute, one would normally presume that Congress intended a particular set of remedies to accompany it. You could say that the silence is meant to -- meant to reflect the fact that Congress knew that these would be enforced in State courts, as well as Federal, and it would allow State courts --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5091 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Congress didn't care.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5092 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- to use whatever --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5093 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Congress wanted to substitute a Federal judgment for the judgment of the States where it said so. And the reason you know that is because that is what is consistent with the purpose of the act and other things are either neutral or negative. Don't interfere with the State unless you have to.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5094 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is one of our principal contentions, Justice Breyer, which is --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5095 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And what, Mr. Lamken, would be the normal procedure in the State? You make an application for a permit to a zoning board. What is the standard operating procedure under State law? Suppose we don't have any telecommunications act in the picture.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5096 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The normal procedure is either under a uniform State law or California law. If you have a -- an entity which is -- excuse me. If you have either a planning commission or sometimes there's another entity that does the initial review and makes a determination whether to grant the permit. It is then appealable either to a zoning board of adjustment -- that's the -- the model act -- or in California, States -- localities have the option of having the appeal go to the local legislature. That appeal is then reviewed -- is then determined. And finally, once you've gone through that process, under California law it's generally reviewable by a writ of mandate, although other -- other States provide review by writ of certiorari, by mandamus, or by various other procedures, almost always subject to a short limitations period, almost always short -- requiring finality, a final decision, exhaustion through the State process.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5097 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the remedies being injunctive and declaratory.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5098 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A -- a form of specific relief. Generally they have the authority to effectively go in and revise the decision below, but the remedies ordinarily do not include monetary or compensatory relief I should say.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5099 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are you saying that it's parallel to what APA review of an agency decision would be?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's very much like that. The remand rule that this Court normally requires in the APA context is not so strictly observed in the context of -- of review of -- judicial review of zoning decisions, but it is very much like APA review. That is what prevails.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it seems to me that the 30-day provision is inconsistent with the award of damages, but after I say that, I can't tell you why. (Laughter.)
03-1601 +++$+++ 5102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, actually this Court's decision in Burnett v. Grattan actually tells you why, and that is that 30-day provisions, which are typical for on-the-record review of decisions below, are often insufficient to allow somebody to develop a whole new record such as their proof of damages, to make important decisions if they're going to have, for example, a jury trial, or to prepare for discovery. And that's why 30-day provisions are not entirely uncommon in the area of judicial review of agency action, but they're wholly unprecedented, for the most part that I know of, in the area of tort-like remedies like section 1983. If I -- if there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, you may. Mr. Feldman.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5105 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Where Congress creates a special cause of action for -- for a violation of a Federal law that necessarily carries with it its own features and incidents, Congress' decisions about the appropriate mechanisms for dealing with that violation of Federal law should not be frustrated or overridden by allowing a 1983 action in addition. In this case, section 332(c)(7)(B)(v), which creates a cause of action for violation of the specific standards in (i) through (iv) is an independent, standalone cause of action. If 1983 didn't exist, 332(c)(7)(B)(v) would, undoubtedly, still provide plaintiffs with a mechanism to get into court and attain redress for the legal wrongs that they claim. Where Congress has taken that step and has thought about what the appropriate remedy should be for a violation of a particular Federal statute and has created a judicial remedy, then it would only frustrate --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5106 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it -- the statute, though, is silent on the question of damages or attorney's fees, isn't it?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5107 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is. It doesn't say anything expressly about either of those things, but I think it has long been --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5108 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can we infer all appropriate relief? Do we?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5109 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As a matter of damages, I think all appropriate relief would be the standard. But as a matter of attorney's fees, I think is a good example of why there shouldn't be a 1983 action here because the law is 100 percent clear, from this Court's decision in Alyeska and other cases, that where Congress hasn't provided for fee-shifting, there simply is no fee-shifting authorized. That's what they intended.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5110 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Attorney's fees are never appropriate, in other words.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5111 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are never appropriate unless Congress specifically provides for them.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5112 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it has provided for them for a 1983 action, and if it's a 1983 action, it takes care of it.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5113 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5114 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And this is kind of circular.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5115 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think it's circular because I think when Congress created the specific cause of action here in (B)(v), it didn't provide for attorney's fees and therefore intended that attorney's fees not be provided. If respondent's view in this case were accepted, the -- the presumption would be exactly flipped, and Congress would have had --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5116 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Feldman --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose Congress said specifically 1983 applies. That's all it says. Would that carry with it attorney's fees in your view?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I -- yes, I think it -- I think it would. The question here, though, is where Congress has thought about what kind of remedy it wants for violation of a Federal statute and created a judicial cause of action for every wrong that's -- that -- that can exist under that statute, then the incidents and features of that cause of action should govern, not the incidents and features of 1983 which almost inevitably and in this case are different. And attorney's fees is just the best example of that. If -- under respondent's view -- when Congress was fashioning this statute, it certainly was aware of this Court's decisions that have repeatedly said that attorney's fees are not available unless they're expressly provided for. And indeed, elsewhere in the Communications Act --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I take -- you -- you take the position that 1983 doesn't apply at all. It's not just attorney's fees. It's damages.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right. But it's just an illustration. There's other differences between the provision here and 1983, but I think the basic point is that where Congress has given thought to the remedy for a particular violation -- type of violation of Federal law and has provided for a judicial cause of action, with whatever features and incidents it -- it wants, 1983 shouldn't be allowed in. It should be assumed that Congress didn't want to have its decisions frustrated by also allowing a 1983 action.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What about damages?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you -- do you think that any other provisions of the Communications Act are enforceable under 1983? I mean, we're talking about 332, but it's a big, complicated act. Are any of the other provisions enforceable?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think -- I think the same rule would apply to any of the provisions where Congress has specifically provided for a cause of action for the same reason, otherwise Congress when -- here, for example, just to return to attorney's fees for a second. When Congress was framing this legislation, they knew that they weren't giving attorney's fees and this 332(c)(7)(B)(v) would be construed not to give attorney's fees, but not --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, this is really a more general proposition you're urging upon us then, that whenever Congress creates a cause of action that is -- what -- in any respect more limited than section 1983, the background action of section 1983 is not available.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- I -- I think that's correct.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5126 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. How could that be? Wouldn't it depend on whether -- when you look at the particular statute, the particular set of remedies that Congress has included in that statute could be absolutely independent of 1983 or dependent upon 1983 or leaning in favor or leaning against. It would depend on the particular statute. Why in general?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5127 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think in -- I think the rule would be in general because, first of all, it's not just remedies. There's other incidents of a cause of action such as statute of limitations, the provision here for expedition, and other things. And really when Congress has given thought to what remedy it wants for a violation here of (i) through (iv), for a violation elsewhere in the Communications Act of other Federal standards, it shouldn't be assumed that they all -- that -- to allow a 1983 action would just frustrate Congress' intent in fashioning that particular remedy.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5128 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then how would you ever have a statute that -- 1983 provides for relief when there's a violation of Federal law, statutory or constitutional. One of the briefs in this very case says that your broad reading means that you were doing away with statute as a basis for 1983.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5129 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I think that that's completely wrong. When Congress has created -- has recognized a right, as this Court has found is essential for a 1983 action, and it hasn't done anything about providing a remedy for that right, hasn't created a cause of action in court in particular, then that's the function of 1983, is to serve -- it provides a cause of action for people who suffer a violation of that wrong, a statutory violation. But where Congress has given thought to what kind of a relief it wanted and it said we want a cause of action with these such-and-such incidents, no attorney's fees, 30-day statute of limitations, expedition, whatever the other ones are here, then it would just frustrate Congress' intent to say, oh, and also you get a 1983 action to undo all of the things that Congress provided for.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5130 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there -- there are two situations. I mean, one can supplement without frustrating. I mean, you -- you could say that in, you know -- in some respects the 1983 will contradict the action that was provided, but one can conceive of a provided action that -- that grants relief which 1983 would not grant.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5131 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right. And -- and I -- whatever -- I guess the general point would be whatever remedial decisions Congress made, those should be respected, but I would add in this case it's not just -- it's a question of attorney's fees, which they would have had to -- Congress would have had to do something very unusual here, which is particularly put in this statute no -- there shall be no fee-shifting because otherwise you can always go to 1983 and get it. In fact, even if they had done that in 332(c)(7)(B)(v), respondents would still argue, well, we still have our 1983 action.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what about damages? Do -- do you take any position on whether the Communications Act provision enables damages to be collected?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't have a position on whether it does. I think there's arguments both ways. I would point out --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You think it's unnecessary to decide this case.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it is unnecessary, and in fact, I think it shows a problem with -- a reason why our view, which is if Congress creates a cause of action, that should be respected -- why that should be respected. Under other views, you have to look at the 1983 action and figure out all of its incidents. You have to look at the 332 action and figure out all of its incidents in the abstract as here, not where -- in connection with a particular claim for damages, and then see whether they're consistent with each other. I think the much better rule would be to say where Congress has created a specific cause of action, that's what it wanted, and whatever you get under that, you get. Whatever you don't get under that, you don't get. But 1983 shouldn't be used to -- to frustrate Congress' intent and give you things that that cause of action wouldn't to give you a longer statute of limitations, which would be, I think, the case here, to give you -- eliminate the provision for mandatory expedition, to have any differences in damages. Another way to put it would be under the Court's decision in Franklin, this statute gives you any appropriate relief. All that 1983 could do here -- it maybe gives you the same thing in which, as far as that goes, it doesn't matter. But all it could do otherwise would be give you inappropriate relief, i.e., relief that Congress didn't want. And instead of construing the two statutes in that way, they should be construed harmoniously and in accord with this Court's decisions which have set forth the line of cases where you have a right to get into court in Wilder -- I'm sorry -- in -- in Sea Clammers and Smith against Robinson and said there we want to take Congress' remedy, however simple or complex it is. It gives you a complete right to get into court and gives you whatever it gives you. And that should govern. And then the other line of cases, which is Wilder where -- and -- where it says -- and the Wright against Roanoke where Congress didn't give you a right to get to court -- get into court. In those cases, that's the function of 1983. The same thing would be true in -- in a number of other this Court's cases that have recognized you have a 1983 action when Congress gave you a right and didn't think at all about the remedy because that's the function that 1983 was supposed to serve. If there's no further questions.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Waxman.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5138 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: In -- by its clear text, section 1983 promises redress for the depravation of any Federal right in any, quote, proper proceeding. And that expansive language, this Court has recognized, dictates a heavy presumption that its remedies apply to all violations of Federal rights, a presumption which this Court has said is rebutted only in the, quote, exceptional case in which the statute that creates the right is accompanied by an enforcement scheme that is, quote, incompatible with or inconsistent with 1983's remedies. That's --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the background principle.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman, it seems to me that the -- the best argument we've heard about incompatibility is the one -- or at least I think the best -- is the one that Mr. Lamken touched on at the tail end of his argument, and that is, he said there's -- there's a 30-day provision in there, which in effect says Congress wants this litigation conducted fast and over with fast. And that is incompatible with a damage action because if you get into a damage action, you are going to get into the panoply of -- of damages litigation, including depositions, and -- and the one thing you can guarantee is that it is not going to be over expeditiously. What is your argument? What is your response to that incompatibility argument?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think that the way this Court has interpreted incompatibility before -- in the two instances in 25 years since Maine v. Thiboutot was decided, the only instances in which this Court has found incompatibility has been where use of 1983 would create an end run around limitations in the statute. That is, in the -- in Sea Clammers and in Smith v. Robinson, you had statutes that forestalled an individual's access to court via an administrative regime and then expressly limited the judicial remedies that would be available once they got there by requiring, for example, only injunctive relief.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the other word is inconsistent, and is it -- sorry. Were you -- is it inconsistent if Congress didn't want it? And if that's insufficient to be inconsistent, then here, as I look at the statute, to get out my thinking, I think that it sounds like an administrative law statute. If I saw the maintenance and cure words, I'd think it was an admiralty statute.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5144 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. I --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5145 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I see an administrative law statute. It sounds like that's the system they're imposing and therefore a system that is not consistent with the administrative law system fails and 1983 seems to fail.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. Now I have two points. I -- I don't want to forget these. I have to deal with the -- the question of whether a 30-day requirement is inconsistent and whether damages would be inconsistent with what -- with what my colleagues posit as an APA-like administrative review model. A 30-day requirement is simply a reflection of Congress' -- Congress confirming expressly that somebody who -- who is aggrieved under the rights provided to him under 332(c)(7) and wants any judicial remedy, whether it's from 1983 or otherwise, has to go to court promptly. It's precisely what 1983, this Court said in Patsy and Felder, guarantees and requires. It does not require --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it also requires expeditiousness on the part of the court.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It requires that the court proceed expeditiously and courts can proceed expeditiously where damages are sought or are not sought. One of the interesting things about damages --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But do you -- do you agree with this much, that if -- if damages, in fact, are going to be allowed, what is going to count as expeditious is going to be a lot slower than what is going to count as expeditious if damages are not allowed.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think that's true. In fact, I think this case is a pretty good example. The court separated it -- I mean, acting under a requirement of expedition at the request of the city. This -- the court didn't even begin to address this case until 18 months after it had been filed. But what it said was --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. And -- and that --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the first issue --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that was a violation of the statute, wasn't it?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it first issued an order saying, okay, I've construed the statute and I've determined that the statute is violated. Now we will have a separate proceeding. Then the city will conduct itself accordingly. Now we'll have a separate proceeding in order to determine whether damages or attorney's fees are available. And that is available in any of these cases. What --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So they turned the damage issue basically just into a separate remedial hearing at the end of the case.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It could or could not be, and there may -- may be many cases when damages aren't appropriate but --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought that was just to decide in -- in the -- in the court of first instance -- that tail end was not to decide whether in this specific case damages or attorney's fees were due. But the district court was deciding a question of law, that is, whether in this kind of review proceeding anyone could have damages, anyone could have attorney's fees.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What he said, Justice Ginsburg, was we'll deal with what other remedies, if any, are available and to what extent in a separate proceeding. As it turns out, he concluded in an --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But was not making a rule for this case only. He was making a ruling of law.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ For sure. He said that I don't think you're entitled to this because I think that the statute doesn't allow it. And therefore, he didn't get to this question. But the point about damages -- I think there are two points that are very important that not be obscured. First of all, the Government -- the fact that the Government and the petitioner can't agree on whether the statute itself provides damages relief under the principle of Bell v. Hood and Franklin v. Gwinnett County certainly shows that Congress did not speak expressly on this subject.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They -- they don't necessarily disagree. The Government just says the -- the issue doesn't have to be reached in this case.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think -- I think that -- what the Government says in its papers is they may well be available and what Mr. Feldman -- I don't want to misquote him, but he said that under Franklin -- he agreed, I think, with what Judge Posner wrote for the Seventh Circuit, which is where no remedies -- where no specific remedies are specified -- and that's the case here -- you apply a rule of judicial implication, announced in Bell v. Hood and applied to an implied right of action in Franklin, to apply that all appropriate relief is available. And damages are the paradigm.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the irony here --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman, how do you -- how do you get a reading of the 30-day limitation, which is applicable to the cause of action under the Communications Act, sucked into the cause of action under section 1983? I mean, if the suit is under 1983, it's under 1983. There's no 30-day limit there.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I have -- I have two different ways to get to that. First of all, section 1983, by its terms, provides redress in any appropriate cause of action. It also supplies a cause of action where no other cause of action is available, but by its express terms, it doesn't exclusively limit its remedies to causes of action that are brought under 1983.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it doesn't.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But more broadly --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't require you to -- to establish a cause of action under some other statute either.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. It provides a --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does not at all. It's -- it's self-contained. And do you know any case where we have read into, or indeed, it's even been urged upon us to read into, section 1983 limitations that somehow come from the statute that was violated and which forms the basis for the 1983 action?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't, but I do know that this Court -- first of all, Congress has now enacted section 1658 which provides a -- a 4-year Federal default statute of limitations, where -- where a statute like 1983 doesn't provide it, but includes an -- an introduction that says, except where otherwise provided by Federal law. And there's certainly nothing in that language that says when you're looking at whether a statute of limitations is otherwise provided by Federal law, you look to the very statute that creates the substantive right that 1983 is enforcing. And even before that, when your -- your decision in Wilson v. Garcia made the point that when you try to figure out what statute of limitations applies to a freestanding 1983 action, there are -- there is a tripartite rule of construction that section 1988 requires you to engage in. And the first part is to see whether there is any, quote, suitable Federal statute of limitations. Now, in constitutional cases, like the one that was at issue in Wilson v. Garcia or under the Social Security Act, which is what was addressed in Maine v. Thiboutot, there were no express causes of action, much less any express statute of limitations. And so this Court said you then go to the second rule, which is what's the most appropriate State limitations, as 1988 requires. But the anomaly of the argument here is we have a background principle that 1983 is available and there is a heavy presumption that it will be available unless it is explicitly incompatible or inconsistent with --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that's why I'm approaching it differently, and I -- I want to get your view on it. I'm taking the word inconsistent and I'm using that as a guide back into the purpose of the statute. And once I do that, I find Congress here anxious, I think, to engage in what I'd call cooperative federalism. They could have run the whole show, but they said we don't want the FCC. We want each city and town to do what they want, subject to a few minimal procedural requirements. If that's right, that means all these damages questions are open. All kinds of things are open, but -- and we'll decide them in a variety of ways, maybe deferring to the State, but one thing is true: 1983 doesn't apply because that is a different set of remedies.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, this is not the APA model. This is not a model of administrative review for a number of reasons. Number one, it is a background -- there -- there -- it is established, for purposes of this case, that this statute creates individual Federal rights and those rights were violated. And the background rule is uniformly -- and this Court has -- has -- in Owens v. City of Indianapolis and many other cases has reinforced the principle that damages are available and 1983 is available where Federal rights are violated by municipalities, whether it's under the Takings Clause or the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause or in statutory cases. What is more --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman -- Mr. Waxman, one of these provisions gives you an option to go to the FCC, the one having to do with emissions. Now, if you sought review from the local decision to the FCC, you petition for FCC relief, would the FCC have authority to give you attorney's fees?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The FCC has said that it does not if you do that. In -- in 2000, when the FCC last reported, one person had chosen to go that route rather than go to Federal court. It --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, isn't that an incongruity that Congress would say you have your choice? Complainant, you can go to the Federal agency, the FCC, or you can go to court.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You can't go to the -- excuse me. I didn't --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So if -- if you have that choice, when you're dealing with the radio emissions, to go the -- why would any litigant ever do that? Why would any attorney ever do that if you don't get fees at the FCC and you do get fees in court? Wouldn't the presumption be that it would work the same way whether you go to the agency, Federal agency, or Federal or State court, that you're in the same situation as respect to fees?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the FCC alternative for a declaration by the FCC applies to only one of the five rights that are provided here, and even if it applied to all of them, I don't think you could possibly infer that --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let's take the one, that -- that one. Are you saying no attorney's fees there because you couldn't get them at the FCC, therefore you shouldn't get them in court?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely not. If -- if there were an instance in which a local zoning official said, you know, I know I'm not supposed to take radio frequencies emissions into account, but I'm going to, it's denied, I would have the right either to go to the FCC and say, tell them no, or to file an action under 332 and/or 1983 and say that violates my rights. And actually your example --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But isn't --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I just may finish. Your example, I think -- the example of this particular provision points out that what -- the balance of what I was going to explain to Justice Breyer, which is that another reason why this isn't the APA model is that this statute includes in little (i) and little (ii) substantive provisions, not just procedural provisions. You can't discriminate, to give Justice O'Connor's first example, among providers. The -- that was a complaint in this case. There is de novo review, it is clear, on those claims. It's not administrative APA review in any respect. And in fact, the district judge in this very case, Judge Wilson, says it looks like, in fact, you were discriminated against, but I don't need to reach that because it's clear that there was no substantial evidence.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They -- they didn't provide for the normal administrative review because they were quite aware that under the State zoning systems, there would always be State administrative review before the issue even comes up.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And this --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And so what this provides is what kind of judicial review there will be after the anticipated administrative review before the zoning board and whatever appeal from the zoning board exists.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I have to respectfully disagree. This Court, in -- in Williamson County and Darby and many other cases, has distinguished carefully between final -- final action and exhaustion of administrative review or judicial review. And all this statute requires is that if you are aggrieved by an action or inaction of a State or local government or an instrumentality thereof --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Final. Final action or failure to act is what --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Final action or failure to.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And final action, this Court has explained, does not import into it exhaustion of either a State administrative or judicial remedies. What it means is that once you have been injured, it's a -- it's a ripeness requirement that's familiar under --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You haven't been injured until you've exhausted your --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- you really think that when there is a State provision available for review of the zoning board, you can commence an action under 1983 without even going through the administrative appeals?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I am entirely certain of that, and in fact, the -- the local ordinance -- I mean, the question of what is final agency action is surely a Federal question, but --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is really respecting the States, which is what the -- the purpose of this -- of this whole provision was.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, when Congress addressed this problem in 1996, as the Government points out in the very first page of its brief and as the legislative history reflects, it was confronting a situation in which intransigent, entrenched zoning authorities were acting arbitrarily to frustrate the creation of a national wireless network. And it was so concerned about this that the House actually passed a provision that removed this paradigmatic local authority to the FCC. The FCC was --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which would be more burdensome? That enactment or subjecting municipalities nationwide to damages? Which would be more intrusive and burdensome on federalism --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and the abilities of local governments to function?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, I think the former, for sure. I mean, the notion that zoning decisions, siting decisions would be removed entirely from localities is unbelievably intrusive. And what happened in the conference committee was a compromise was reached whereby Congress' objective was going to be achieved by creating -- by leaving it, in the first instance, Justice Kennedy, to local --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm -- I'm not so sure because you're arguing that even the smallest municipality can be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney's fees.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- let me just say this, with respect to the --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Plus other -- plus other damages.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think this case, Justice Kennedy -- I have three things to say about this. Just this case is every bit as -- as paradigmatic as the parade of horribles that they suggest. And here's my proof. It has been since 1997 that courts have been ruling that 1983 and damages are available under this statute. There is no evidence in any of the briefs on the other side or any of their amici that there has either been a flood of litigation or inappropriately large awards. And if that happened, Congress would do -- would be attentive to it in the way that Justice Ginsburg pointed out when the local cable authorities came to -- came to the very same committees 4 years before and said, we're being hit -- there's an express right of action in 555 of the -- the Communications Act. We're being hit with very large 1983 awards. Please do something about it. And the very same committees 4 years before enacted a provision that said you may get only injunctive and declaratory relief, thereby creating an incompatibility with 1983, as the legislative history expressly provides.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, cable -- cable media companies may -- may have Congress' ear more readily than -- than -- you know, than the municipality of whatever this is or any --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ State and -- than State and local governments? I hope not. But here's -- here's the additional --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I -- I wouldn't put a lot of money on it. (Laughter.)
03-1601 +++$+++ 5214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The point is that Congress -- Justice Kennedy, the point is not that Congress was being inattentive to State and local budgets. What it wanted to do what was this -- the point this Court the addressed in -- in Stakura and -- and Owens v. City of Indianapolis, which is to enforce a Federal statute through privately enforceable Federal rights, which would include a damages remedy that both provides a deterrent against conduct that had provided entrenched resistance to a Federal program and provide compensation where reasonable and appropriate. Now, this Court has made clear, with respect to damages, in -- in Carey v. Piphus and other cases, that there may be very many cases in which there's a violation of a procedural right but only nominal damages are available. And in Buckhannon --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But with respect to --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I may just finish this sentence. And in Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, this Court has -- has recognized that in order to get attorney's fees, you have to have substantially prevailed and a court, under 1988(b), may award attorney's fees in its -- may award -- in its discretion insofar as they are reasonable. And --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. -- Mr. Waxman.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Justice Ginsburg.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is in this legislative record a concern expressed by a Senator from California when there was a proposal on the table to make the FCC the Federal review forum. And that was rejected, if I understand correctly, because there was a concern that municipalities would have to travel all the way to Washington, D.C. to defend in the FCC's forum. And Congress did not want to saddle municipalities with the cost of transporting their representative to D.C. Well, that cost would pale compared to attorney's fees that would be awarded.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ First of all, Justice Ginsburg, I -- the reference to those two Senators -- what those two Senators were talking about is not, as my colleague's brief suggests, this provision. They were talking about another provision of the Telecom Act. I think it was section 253, but I may be wrong. But even if that's the case, the fact of the matter is that whether it was going to cost them -- I agree. It would cost -- look, a regime in -- which left all of these siting decisions to the FCC is breathtaking, and it certainly would impose lots of costs not only on local municipalities to have to come to Washington to justify these decisions, but certainly on the FCC, which would have to send an army out to example -- I mean, it would sort of like be the -- the television commercial, you know, where the guy is walking around saying, you know, can you hear me now, can you hear me now? The fact is it made great sense to continue to leave the initial decisions with local authorities. But Congress had -- was frustrated, expressly frustrated with the fact that the prior regime, in which they had let local authorities do it under their normal routines and applying the normal remedies, was not getting the job done. That was the imperative of this statute. And in the -- in the absence of any evidence, even now 11 years later -- or I guess it's 10 years -- 9 years later. In the absence of any evidence of a flood of litigation or inappropriate awards, I think given the very heavy presumption that this Court has recognized over and over and over again, that 1983 is there.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That isn't the only --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ 1983 is the background principle against which Congress legislates. And this statute either -- neither provides nor excludes any remedies, and all it does is confirm that when you go -- when you are injured, you can go to court. And --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The other -- the other harm is there any evidence of because it's -- it would also be harmful if local zoning boards, when faced with quite difficult decisions, because the -- the antenna -- they bristle up and you put them in the wrong place. They're environmentally harmful. They -- there are a lot of bad things, as well as good things about them. And of course, it would be a bad impact if we discovered that the zoning boards were erring too much on the side of granting everybody's application, as well as too much on the side of not granting them.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To be sure.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And so I -- I don't know how -- what the -- there won't be evidence. How can we get evidence on such a thing?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the -- you -- the evidence will be either in the decided cases or by local municipal governments coming to Congress and saying, this is too heavy a thumb on the scale. But what we know is that if you afford only prospective relief, which is the -- the ancien regime that Congress was -- that Congress felt wasn't doing the job, it provides no deterrent, no incentive to accomplish what Congress said was --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I -- I don't think we --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- a compelling national objective.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think we usually think of -- of judicial review of agency decisions in the ordinary course as being a deterrent.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's an opportunity to elaborate reasons. It's a safeguard. It's not a deterrent. And you're saying it has to be a deterrent. And as Justice Breyer indicates, it -- it means that there's -- there's another voice in that -- in that administrative hearing room. They're terrified of damages.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Kennedy --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it's going to skew the decisions.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, it -- under their -- under the regulations of this municipality, which is -- is perfectly representative, it is final agency action when the city planning commissioner says no, unless you choose to appeal it to the city council. And there is -- not only is there nothing peculiar about applying 1983 damages awards to the violation by a State and local government of an express Federal right, assuming you can prove not only that the right was violated but also that you were really damaged. It's -- I'm not suggesting that -- that Congress had damages in mind specifically and only to deter conduct. You have said in a variety of instances -- I mentioned Stacura in particular -- that 1983 damages do serve as a deterrent to violation of Federal rights by municipal local officials. But what Congress had -- Congress had to come up with some way to confront this problem in which there were sort of local parochial --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask this question, Mr. Waxman? I don't know if it's really a legal question exactly, but I have the impression that most of the plaintiffs in this type of litigation are well-financed, large companies rather than the typical 1983 plaintiff. And therefore, you don't need the attorney's fee incentive to be sure these rights are protected. Is that a correct impression or is it incorrect?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I don't know whether it's a correct impression or not. Our brief points the Court to an authority that at least 9,500 of the entities that have -- have created antennas or tower facilities have 10 or fewer facilities. And one thing we know for sure is that when Congress enacted the Telecom Act of 1996, it specifically wanted to encourage small operations, start-up companies. It had specific provisions in the law to give special treatment to small entrepreneurs in order to foster diversity and competition. But in the event that you --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I can't imagine -- I can't imagine, Mr. Waxman, that Congress wanted to impose damages plus attorney's fees upon municipalities without even giving the municipalities the chance to correct their mistakes, which is what you're saying.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're saying the municipalities' appeal system, which is there for people to take advantage of, is just washed out. One mistake at the lowest level and you get damages and you get attorney's fees. That -- that is extraordinary.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, the -- the -- 1983 -- and your jurisprudence shouts this as clearly as it does any other principle -- stands for the proposition that it's there unless, in the explicit language of the statute that creates the right, there is a demonstrated incompatibility. And that's the background rule. There are many instances in the Telecom Act and elsewhere in which Congress has said you can only get injunctive relief. You may not get 1983 damages. I mean, go back to Adickes v. Kress where this Court said in title II of the Public Accommodations Act, Congress expressly -- expressly precluded damages in order to avoid invocation of 1983. And I'm not saying that Congress had in mind my client, who is an individual, a sole entrepreneur, who was subject to, I think what the record shows is, prolonged and entrenched intransigence by this particular municipality, any more than it had Judge Posner's example in the Seventh Circuit where it was, you know, Verizon v. the Village of Mequon. But this Court has recognized, as have the lower courts, that you only get damages if you prove that you really have been damaged. And in an instance where there's some procedural violation and a remand to correct it, this may very well be the instance of Carey v. Piphus, where the damages are purely nominal. The agency is given the opportunity. In this case, the city never said, give us the opportunity to go back and correct it. And Judge Wilson, a very level-headed district judge, said there's nothing to go back and correct because the only thing -- the only reason that the city gave was it didn't like this antenna and tower in the first place. It -- we concede that it makes no difference to anybody which frequencies are being broadcast from this tower that we approved 10 years ago and have no right to modify. And therefore, there was a substantive violation, not just, you know, you -- you may have had substantial evidence but you didn't lay it all out or you gave your reasons at length and orally but not in writing, I'll give you the opportunity to go back. There's a line of cases this Court has decided under the Social Security Act where there have been remands to correct procedural errors or small errors, and in those instances, Carey v. Piphus says you don't get damages. And under Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, you probably don't get attorney's fees either. If there ever is the sort of parade of horribles that they protest about, even a small parade of horribles, Congress will be as attentive as it was in 1992 when the cable --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Waxman.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Lamken, you have about 4 minutes left.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5245 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'd like to make only two brief points. First, that the imposition of the -- of damages and fees under section 1983 from a decision in this Court for even good faith mistakes in the implementation of the antenna siting rules, which are often complex and uncertain, would be a welcome mat for extensive and aggressive litigation and the imposition of extensive fees on municipalities which simply cannot afford to enforce their zoning rules, the rules that Congress expressly attempted to preserve in the statute itself. It is -- in this case alone, for example, respondent's most recent estimate of his damages and fees -- and this was before he retained Mr. Waxman, I might add -- is -- is $15 million, essentially the city's entire budget for a year. And respondent claims to be a relatively small operator. That sort of -- with that sort of liability in an uncertain area of law, very few municipalities could ever afford to stand on their rights to enforce local zoning even when they're relatively certain that they are right. Section 332(c)(7) is entitled and has one of its purposes as the preservation of local authority. It should not be construed to provide for that authority's evisceration. The second point I wanted to hit is that when Congress established the mechanism for review in 332, it provided a very adapted mechanism with an unusual pair of characteristics: a very short limitations period and mandatory expedition. This Court's decisions in Novotny makes it clear that neither of those requirements can be simply transferred over to section 1983. Novotny had very similar language, a 90-day limitations period. The Court did not transfer that over to section 1983. Instead it understood that the general rule, the general Federal principle of law, that in the absence of an express limitations period, that State law would control. Wilson then confirms that rule, as an interpretation of section 1988, that the governing Federal principle is that State law controls unless there's an express Federal cause of -- statute that addresses that particular cause of action. If there are no further questions, we ask only that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed. Thank you.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Lamken. The case is submitted.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5250 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ And we will now hear argument in McCreary County against the ACLU. Mr. Staver?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5252 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens and may it please the Court. Before this Court is a setting of law in a courthouse and a display on law that contains the universally recognized symbol of law. Despite the fact that the deck law occupies only one tenth of this otherwise secular display, the Sixth Circuit struck it down. The Court focused solely on the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments and that's aired by ignoring the overall context. The Ten Commandments is unlike most any other acknowledgment. It is in a category essentially all by itself. It is thematic in common places in courthouses while Nativity scenes and menorahs occur occasionally and often gratuitously on public property. The Ten Commandments occurs quite frequently and has for more than a century in courthouses all over this nation. It is associated with courthouses for a clear historic reason, because the Ten Commandments has played an influential role in American law and government and our system of law in this country. The context in this case is clearly important. Yet the Sixth Circuit --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask you there basically to comment on the point that Justice Scalia made in the course of the last argument? The context, as we know, has changed pretty radically in the course of litigation over this and it started out with just the Ten Commandments alone and then version 2, the Ten Commandments had certain -- were surrounded by certain quotations of religious content from other texts. And finally, as I guess literally is true with a new lawyer and more litigation, we've gotten to the present context. Isn't the problem that you have to face, as I've said before, what Justice Scalia raised before, everybody knows what's going on. Everybody knows that the present context is simply litigation dressing and that the object for what is going on is the object that was revealed in the first place. What is your response to that?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Several. The display in this case has three different phases. First it was the stand-alone Ten Commandments. They were sued. They could have defended that but they chose instead to switch rather than fight because they wanted to try to comply with this Court's establishment clause jurisprudence, to try to figure out how to be able to display this particular document. They stepped, however, on a land mine admittedly with this second display.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they created the land mine basically. I mean --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They were trying to do the best that they could, trying to follow this ever bending establishment clause jurisprudence especially in the area of displays. Remember this was back in 1999. At that time, there were less than a handful of reported decisions ever in this country on the Ten Commandments. The first was in 1973, Stone was in 1980 and there were a couple of others. There are only 30 reported cases in the country or so and 23 of those happened from 1999 to the present so they didn't have really any guidance. They were trying to follow Lynch and Allegheny as best as they could but these are governmental officials. They're not jurists schooled in the law. And admittedly they made a mistake. But what they have now is the foundation is display and as the District Court recognized, it is fundamentally different than any previous display. Like this Court's decision in the Sunday law cases, even though it may have started off for a religious purpose, the Sunday laws were continued to be retained for secular reasons. In this case --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are you saying that the purpose is neutral or that the purpose doesn't matter?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We're saying that in this case, the purpose is about the display of law. We also have an argument later on that this Court should reconsider the purpose in generally as it relates to the Lemon test.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, but if we still have a purpose inquiry, what you say of course is true. The current display includes the display of a lot of legal documents. But is there any reason for anyone to believe that that display of legal documents or anything else would be there for any other purpose than the display of the Ten Commandments, including the religious, the overtly theistic part of the text?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. The District Court actually recognized that one of the omni intended effects of the history is to educate everyone of the difference between an acknowledgment and an establishment. And even if they had a religious purpose under the second display, that religious purpose has been buried and has been abandoned. They voluntarily accepted the --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're not abandoning the position that you have a right to make this kind of religious display, are you?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, we're not.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that's why we said that they could have defended the individual first display which was the Ten Commandments alone, in part because it is the uniquely recognized historic symbol of law and is commonplace and thematic in the courthouse. They could have defended when they were originally sued on that basis alone but instead they chose to modify the display. And when they modified the display, it had excerpted sections around it.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But is there -- I guess -- I don't want to tie you up too long but I mean given the history, isn't it still the case that there is no serious reason to believe that there is any object here other than the display of the Ten Commandments including the overtly theistic text and the rest of this is basically enabling context which does not affect the objective, the objective being the Ten Commandments and the religious text?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, they must be able to change their misstep, if it was a misstep, that they had. Otherwise, that past case would be superimposed on the foundation's display forever and the question would be --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, not forever but for now. This isn't a case in which they came up with the Ten Commandments display, it got enjoined and 10 years later somebody comes along and says, let's have a display of important documents in the history of law. This in fact is a continuous process and it is a continuous process within the context of litigation about the constitutionality of the display. It's not a -- the implication is not that you can never have a different display but that there is no reason to believe that the intent of this display has changed as the context has changed. What is your response to that?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The intent has certainly broadened in this case and there is clearly no evidence in this record that this foundations display is solely purposed or intended to be a religious display. In fact, even the respondents of amici that wrote against us said that on the face of this display, it appears secular in nature. It does. In fact, the foundations display not only has numerous other documents of which the Ten Commandments is only one tenth of these many other document but it also has a foundations document that says what the purpose is about. There is only two places that talk about the purpose on the foundations display. On the document itself, which says it's a display about some documents that influenced American law and government, and the undisputed testimony that these are documents that reflect documents that have influenced American law and government. That's the record before this Court on the foundations display and that is fundamentally different --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose we go back to the first display. If all that was there was the Ten Commandments, now, in your opinion, was that constitutional?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is arguably constitutional --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do we take it along with the resolution of the counties? Do we look at everything?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, there was no resolution, Justice O'Connor, for the first display. It just went up.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So just that first display, what was the purpose of that first one?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The purpose of that first one is like it is in many courthouses around the country. Both courthouses have numerous documents of his historical nature along the walls,284 just in the curia alone. And in Pulaski, many, many documents, when they celebrated their 200th anniversary in 1999. So that was one of many documents that's there and that was a document of the Ten Commandments that was meant to show the historic nature of the Ten Commandments, how it has in fact influenced American law and government in the appropriate setting of a courthouse.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The original one?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The original one.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was there anything there that said we're interested in history and what we're not interested in is having this on the wall as -- to encourage people to study the Bible and to encourage them to study religion and to understand that in their lives, religion should be important and this very solemn secular setting. Nonetheless, religion is important. Is there anything like that on the document itself?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, it was just the document itself in a frame on a wall amongst almost 300 other documents.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What if its purpose were to demonstrate -- and I quote from one of our earlier opinions -- that we are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. What if that were its purpose? Would that have made it bad?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't believe so, Justice Scalia, because that in fact is an acknowledgement that is part of our history; like in Marsh versus Chambers. That's why this Court has authorized prayers before legislative sessions or suggested that the national motto is constitutional because indeed we are a religious people as this Court has said more than five times. We are a religious people. Our institutions do presuppose the existence of a Supreme Being.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And is it your position that no real harm is inflicted on people who do not agree with that message?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor. Justice Kennedy, it would not inflict any harm because in this case, it's a passive display in a courthouse in a hallway and you could simply walk past that and avert your eyes once you see this. It inflicts no harm, it does not --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Staver, what about all the distinctions that have been made between messages that are brief or I think the expression has been minimal or minimum in some of our cases, like in God we Trust, like God save the United States and this Honorable Court, like under God, and a document that is about worshipping the Lord, at least as many words devoted to that topic. So it's not a brief reference. It's a powerful statement of the covenants that the Lord is making with his people.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the Ten Commandments is a unique symbol in the area of acknowledgment because of its historic role in influencing our law and government. It is displayed in this context for that unique role. It does have some statements in there about God but, frankly, very few when you look at the overall context.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Have you read the first four commandments and could you say that?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. And those are definitely and decidedly religious. There is no question that the Ten Commandments is a religious document. There is also no question that it has influenced our American law.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think the Ten Commandments are longer than the legislative prayers you've heard at the beginning of congressional sessions?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Scalia. I think they're quite shorter.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know how much help I can get or not but I was thinking in terms of the involvement of the government, is the government involved in religion when it posts the Ten Commandments alone? Yes, of course it is. Now, there could be a purpose to it, that they want to just show the history of law but it's all by itself and there is a lot more history than that and context may matter a lot. Not everybody will go with the Ten Commandments just by itself there and say, well, gee, this seems to go too far. This is going too far. Why? Because it isn't really related to history, it's the only thing up there, it's involvement in religion, so forth. Now, suppose I go down that track because what I'm really looking for is a key as to what's too far and what's not. But for present purposes, let's assume it's too far. Now, once they've gone too far there, the next thing that happens is they keep changing it but they change it pursuant to the resolution and it seems as if in context, all they've tried to do is to surround what went too far with a number of other things that would somehow make it legal. Now, if it was wrong to begin with, is it wrong to end with?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Breyer, it is not wrong to end with any more than it would be wrong to begin with the Sunday laws based upon the Sabbath commandment which was a commandment about worship and the end with the secular reason for keeping those particular laws as this Court has recognized in McGowan. And in this case, even if they started off with a decidedly and only religious purpose, which we contend they did not, they did not end with one and they've got to, as governmental officials, be able to adjust their missteps whenever they step on a constitutional land mine that is sometimes blurry and confusing to them. That's what they tried to do in this case, the best efforts to try to follow this Court's decision when there was really no specific guidelines for them to be guiding their direction. The Ten Commandments that Justice Stevens, you had mentioned about the versions, the versions I don't believe, with all due respect, are relevant in this case or any other case regarding the Ten Commandments because if that were the case, you wouldn't be able to teach the Bible in an appropriate context because there are so many different versions and yet Stone and Schempp has indicated that you indeed can teach even the Biblical text with all of its multiple versions.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I assume if you were running a course in a school about the biblical text, you would explain the differences. You would indicate the difference between the Jewish, the Roman, the Protestant, the Lutheran and so on and you're not doing that here. I would have thought your answer might be, well, if that really made a difference, we could have separate versions. But it's not comparable to school teaching.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Souter, it would in fact be somewhat comparable because if you're teaching general biblical text, you wouldn't have all the versions lined out.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would you think it was appropriate in a public school course that was otherwise a bona fide course to teach the day on exodus, to teach about simply the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We would believe that, in fact, in this case, I don't even think they thought about whether there were different versions but we certainly believe that they could have the text there and talk about the Ten Commandments.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In a public school, wouldn't it be required, at least for intellectual reasons if not the reasons of the establishment clause to say, well, graven images are dealt with differently in the standard Roman translation and the preamble sections of what may and may not be regarded as commandment number 1 are different in the Christian versus Jewish and so on. Wouldn't that be an intellectually responsible requirement?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's in a school context which this is a courthouse context.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Exactly. I thought you were equating the two together.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not one to one but I think the version issue, if there is a version that flunks the test, it would be this Court's south frieze. It's actually in Hebrew and it speaks only to Jewish people. But yet that's not sectarian such that it violates the establishment clause. That's the acknowledgment as opposed to an establishment. Justice Stevens, if you would like, I would like to reserve the remaining of my time.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, you may do so. Mr. Clement, you're welcome to stand up for a second time.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5301 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court. The display of historical documents here, like the display in the Lynch against Donnelly case of the creche, may include a religious item without running afoul of the establishment clause. As in the --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do we have to consider the history of the display at all?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice O'Connor, we would urge you not to consider the history of the display. You in your concurring opinion in the Pinette case made the point that in the context of accommodations, the inquiry into religious purpose doesn't make a lot of sense and you urged the Court to drop it in that context. I think so too in the acknowledgment context. Certainly if you have a situation where you don't have -- I think in the acknowledgment context as well, a focus on purpose may not be that productive. But I would like to talk about the purpose --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Souter, I have two points in response. First of all, what I think would be a crazy way of having a jurisprudence is for the Court to say that this display is a foundation to the law document, it's perfectly constitutional in every other county courthouse in Kentucky except for McCreary County and Pulaski County because of their prior conduct. The second point that I think is important in this context is that I think this Court's establishment clause jurisprudence is already difficult enough to apply without creating the First Amendment equivalent of covered jurisdictions under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Basically, and I think I understand you, you're saying, and I think you said it earlier, drop the intent clause and basically have a -- try to move toward an objective criterion saying there are some ways you can display religious things and some ways perhaps that you can't and try to develop that kind of objective jurisprudence as distinct from an intent jurisprudence. That's your point, isn't it?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That would be my point, Justice Souter, but I also think independent of that point, it is also not a particular productive jurisprudence to really treat different municipalities differently because the mayor in one case may have started with the creche and decided to add the wishing well or in the other case started the wishing well and added the creche. I don't think it makes any sense that if they end up in the same place, the constitutional rules could be the same.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Clement, you placed heavy reliance on Marsh, which was prayer and it was undisguised and it was permitted to have since the beginning of our nation. Would it be equally compatible with the establishment clause if this Court opened its daily sessions with prayer?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure that I could the jurisprudence that said this Court could not open its sessions with a prayer but the Capitol can. Now, if there was any difference drawn at all, I would assume it would be a difference based on history.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not sure we don't deal with it. I don't know who we're addressing when we say God save the United States and this Honorable Court.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The kind of prayer that is used to open the legislative sessions which this Court has distinguished from in God we trust, God save the United States and this Honorable Court.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And as I said, Justice Ginsburg, I think if there were a difference in principle, it would have to be a difference based on history. But I don't think there is -- in this context, I think it is fair to say --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm asking you what your view is of the compatibility of every federal Court in the country having over the bench a replica of the Ten Commandments and opening each session with prayer.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I suppose if the federal courts decided to do that, we would probably try to defend them on establishment clause grounds. I don't think, though, that -- I think that would obviously be a much tougher case than the posting of the Ten Commandments in the outer hallway along with a variety of other documents which I take it to be the first case here. And then the final display that the Court has before it is actually the Ten Commandments in the context of the other secular historical documents. And I think that kind of display clearly is constitutional for the reasons that the display was constitutional in the Lynch case.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think we have to amend the Lemon test to reach your approach?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice O'Connor, this Court on a variety of occasions has chosen to simply put Lemon to one side as opposed to overtly amending it.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think, then, we have to either put it aside or amend it?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I don't, Justice O'Connor.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To decide this case?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I don't. I think it would be prudent, as I suggested at the outset, to make not necessarily a full amendment and eliminate the first purpose prong of Lemon but at least in the acknowledgment context as in the accommodation context we're not going to focus on that. But independent of that, I think many of these Court's cases that were decided even under Lemon acknowledge the principles that municipalities should be rewarded, not punished, nor trying to change their conduct to try to get things right. In Abbington against Schempp, which I think in many respects is a precursor to Lemon because it talked at least about the purpose and effects test and I gather that's about all that's left of Lemon. In that case, this Court held out the promise that it might be permissible for the government to have some use of the Bible in school. Now, when it did that, it didn't except out Abbington township and said, but not for you, Abbington township, because you violated the purpose prong. The Sixth Circuit here has adopted a rule that once mistaken, always condemned and we don't think that has any proper place in this Court's establishment of jurisprudence.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Friedman?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5325 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens and may it please the Court, three times in the course of a year, McCreary and Pulaski county posted Ten Commandments displays. They variously describe the Ten Commandments as the precedent legal code of Kentucky, the central historic legal document of the State and, finally, as the moral background of the Declaration of Independence and the foundation of our legal system. In the course of the litigation, they announced that under current law, they announced to the curt that uncurrent law, America is a Christian nation and they acknowledge that the purpose of their second display was to demonstrate America's Christian heritage. In this context, it is our position that the current courthouse display reveals both a purpose and an effect to endorse religion. This Court has repeatedly and most recently in the Santa Fe case made clear that it is necessary to look at the content, the context and the history of a display in order to gauge whether or not there is a true secular purpose or whether or not an asserted secular purpose is a sham. We submit here that on this record, the District Court and particularly in the context of an appeal from a preliminary injunction, which we have here, that the District Court had ample evidence from which it could conclude that the asserted secular purpose of McCreary and Pulaski counties was indeed a sham. The counties announced their purpose not only in the content of the display itself but in the resolution that the counties enacted, the identical resolutions that the counties enacted within weeks after the filing of this lawsuit. And in that resolution, the counties make clear that they relied on and cited approvingly the Kentucky legislature's reference to Jesus Christ as the prince of ethics. They made clear that they supported the fight of Alabama Supreme Court justice Roy Moore against the ACLU. They made absolutely clear in their legal papers that they deemed this to be a Christian nation under current law and they made clear that they absolutely intended and believed they had the right to display the Ten Commandments. They did so not in a display of history. They asserted and they intended to do so because of the religious nature of the Ten Commandments. There can be no doubt that the Ten Commandments portrays a religious point of view and is profoundly religious. The Court said so in Stone. There is no serious question about that. The question then here is whether or not the counties, in their current display, have done anything to sufficiently neutralize the endorsing message that is contained in this record. And we submit it has not done so. It now announces that the Ten Commandments are the foundation of our legal system, not just that religion is but that the Ten Commandments, a particular religious code, the word of God, it asserts is the foundation of our legal system. It asserts that the Ten Commandments, the revealed Word of God, provides the moral background of the Declaration of Independence. We think it's clear that the content of the Ten Commandments and the content of the Declaration of Independence deal with substantially different topics.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose you had a county 100 miles away or a state, a different state, and the same display was put on and the recitation was -- and it was a sincere recitation, that the government simply wanted to recognize that the 10 Commandments has played an important role in the civic lives of our people. Then you have -- they're each up for five years and five years later, some school kids wander by one and they wander by the other. In your view, from what you're telling me, the Commandments are permitted in one location and not the other? I mean, that's the necessary purport of your argument. You may not think that either of them are valid but on this prong of the argument, it seems to me that to differentiate, I just don't understand that.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think to an extent there is a differentiation because this Court has made clear that any assessment must depend on context. There is no fixed per se rule but rather, the context one must both look at the purpose and the effect. In gauging the purpose, one looks at both the litigation history, the social facts, the content and any changes. Here the District Court had not only the display itself but it had the announced purpose of the county. It therefore was in a unique position to gauge the purpose of the -- the true purpose of these counties. Moreover, it was in a unique position to gauge the effects that the reasonable observer in these small rural Kentucky counties, the reasonable observer assessment of this particular display. And the Court -- McCreary County is a county with only 17,000 people. Whitley City, the county seat, which is not even incorporated, has 1,100 people. The District Court from its chambers in London, Kentucky was well situated to gauge whether or not the reasonable observer, knowing the litigation history of this case and knowing the changes in the forum and the context of this display, would perceive this to be a neutral recitation of history or simply the third in a series of efforts by this county government to post the Ten Commandments because that is what it wanted to post.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does that mean forever? What I'm thinking -- let me spell it out. The key words in Stone would be that this was posted, the Ten Commandments, because it would lead to, in the circumstances, the students remeditate, venerate, perhaps, and obey. In other words, their reaction to it would likely be a religious reaction. Now, here if you saw it just by itself, perhaps one would be concerned with the intent or the effect of calling to the viewer's mind the sacred character of the law, which is fine for religious people to do but not necessarily fine for the State to do; and that leads them to venerate, perhaps to meditate, perhaps to consider the relationship in a religious way. If that's the problem, that would exist here only because of the history or most likely because of the history. And if that is the problem, that would dissipate over time because it is the smallness of the audience and their familiarity with the history that would likely produce the similar religious reaction to the display. Now, what's your reaction?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it's a question of degree and while over time the importance of the purpose may diminish, the purpose does not fully diminish and the effect does not change substantially. It is a question of degree, it is a question of line drawing. Here there is not an effort to incorporate the Ten Commandments into a neutral display or a neutral course of study such as a compare and contrast of ancient moral codes or a comparative religion course such as many of us have taken and schools clearly can offer. It is not a neutral display of law givers like the frieze in this Court. It asserts the primacy of the Ten Commandments. It says the Ten Commandments are the moral background of the Declaration of Independence. It doesn't say there is some commonality between the Ten Commandments and some American laws. It talks not only about law. It talks about our system of government. It says the Ten Commandments, the revealed Word of God is the moral foundation of the Declaration of Independence. That in itself is an endorsement of religion in this context and I don't think that can dissipate over time.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is it? It may be true. These pilgrims came for religious reasons. If all you have is a display of the origin of the law in the United States, what would be wrong with saying, this is a historical account? It's like teaching religion in the schools. Of course it stemmed from the religious beliefs of those who came to the United States. You don't mean it religiously. You mean it historically.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's the difference between acknowledgment and endorsement. Of course counties and other governments can acknowledge the role that religion played in history. That is very different from acknowledging religion as a general matter and asserting that a specific code that is central to specific religions is the one -- not only the one religious source but the one source, religious or moral, that provide -- religious or secular that provides the moral background of the Declaration of Independence.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't care it stands for that. As you heard, the code takes various forms for various religions. And I think all it stands for is the proposition that the moral order is ordained by God. That's all it stands for. And to say that that's the basis of the Declaration of Independence and of our institutions is entirely realistic.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What this display says --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think they're really saying that the particular commandments of the Ten Commandments are the basis of the Declaration of Independence. That's idiotic. What the commandments stand for is the direction of human affairs by God. That's what it stands for.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Whatever the merit of that statement, that is not what these counties have said. What these counties have said in their resolutions is that the Ten Commandments are the precedent legal code of Kentucky and the central historic legal document of the state. What they have said in this display itself, in the explanation of the display, that they are the moral background of the Declaration of Independence, to the exclusion of all others, in effect. When you say the, it doesn't say one of. It says it is the foundation of our legal system. It doesn't say it had an influence on some of our laws. It asserts the primacy, the actual text of this display asserts the primacy of the Ten Commandments.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that's what it means, it's idiotic. I don't think anybody is going to interpret it that way. You can't get the Declaration of Independence out of the Ten Commandments.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5337 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would agree with that, Your Honor.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5338 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I don't think that's how somebody would normally read it. I think what they're saying is the principle of laws being ordained by God is the foundation of the laws of this state and the foundation of our legal system.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How long is that resolution going to guide our view of the future displays or even the present one? What about the membership of the board of supervisors is changed? How long do we look to that particular resolution?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think, Your Honor, it's an element that the District Court in the first instance must accept and gauge in determining whether or not the announced secular purpose is indeed a true purpose or is a sham. Where we're talking about a close time period, here three displays in less than a year by the same officials of the same county trying to post the same document, this case becomes very close to the Santa Fe independent school district case where it's a moving target in direct response to pending litigation as an effort to try to get the same end result and changing the operative facts just slightly in the hope that eventually it will be right.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you a question on that point? And I should know the answer. It must be in the briefs but I don't remember. I assume that they rescinded the resolution before version 3 of the display was put up, is that correct?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is not in the record.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then I don't think we should talk about it.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The District Court was well situated to understand the social fact, historical record and arguments of both the lawyers and the parties and the statements of the parties.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Friedman, can you tell me where in the joint appendix the resolution appears?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Joint Appendix page 1, number 5, and it's Exhibit 1 attached to it. And that's the one of the counties. The other one is -- and these are the docket entries. The document itself is not in the joint appendix. And the other county is joint appendix page 28, number 6. They're both Exhibit 1s attached to those documents. Those documents are the county's motions to dismiss in the District Court.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not printed?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is not in the appendix itself, no. The resolution is not in there. The citation to it from the index is there.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is in the record which we have?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is in the record. It was submitted in fact by the petitioners in this case. They submitted the resolution in support of their arguments defending the second display, the display that surrounded the Ten Commandments with the religious text. They made clear in that brief that they were asserting their right to display the Ten Commandments as part of their argument that the purpose was to demonstrate America's Christian heritage. I submit that in that brief, in that resolution, in the repeated statements of the county officials and of their counsel, the District Court was well within its discretion to determine that the purpose here was religious, was not secular and that the effect, as viewed by the reasonable observer, was religious -- was to endorse religion, not secular. If there are additional questions, I would be happy to answer it.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The other question I have is assuming you didn't have any of this history and they started off with plan 3, would that have violated the establishment clause?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, I think it would. It would be a closer question but in this context, what we have is the assertion that the Ten Commandments are the source, the moral background of the Declaration of Independence, the foundation of our legal system. It is not incorporating the Ten Commandments as part of a neutral course of study. It is not like having Moses along with 15 other or 15 law givers. It is the assertion of the primacy of the Ten Commandments.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't understand the difference. I mean it seems to me it would violate the establishment clause, it would equally do so if you said it's a major part of or even a part of. Now, maybe it makes it wrong to say it's the exclusive one. It may make it more wrong but we're not grading papers here. It seems to me that whether it violates the establishment clause depends upon whether you're endorsing -- whether you're proselytizing religion.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that's correct, Your Honor.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What does primacy have to do with it?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it makes it an easier case when it asserts this is the one rather than one of several or one of many.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But your real position is they wouldn't have to have done that as long as they had the Ten Commandments in the display, that would be enough?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it depends on the content and context of the display.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Exactly what we've got in Exhibit 3 or whatever it is, that we don't have the statement of purposes, we don't have them saying it's the sole source of the primacy. They say it's a source. Does that still violate the establishment clause?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it does, Your Honor.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Since you have a minute, give me your opinion to the right standard if hypothetically you start with the Goldberg-Schempp idea, that the government is not absolutely forbidden by the establishment clause to recognize the religious nature of the people nor the religious origins of much of our law and so forth but it's easy to go too far and it's easy in this area you are trading on eggs to become far more divisive than you hoped and really end up with something worse than if you stayed out in the first place. In other words, it's a very delicate matter and it's very easy to offend people. Now, suppose you start with that. You're trying to define what is too far constitutionally speaking. What's your test? Of the many that have been in our opinions, which do you think works the best for that purpose or some other?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the Court's endorsement test has stood the test of time and has worked well. It allows the District Courts that are most familiar with what is actually happening to look at both the purpose and the effect of a particular display. I don't think there can be an ironclad rule. There can be presumptions. There can be brighter line tests perhaps. But I think ultimately --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Within reason outline an approach that would say a religious display is presumptively for -- is a presumptive endorsement. I think with the Baptist brief. Would you endorse that test?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We think that test can work very well in a context like this where we're talking about the display of religious texts rather than just symbols. And the point I think is well worth considering, that we assume that when people post signs or displays, bumper stickers, buttons, that they endorse the content of that text and that the presumption then would place a burden on government to make sure that it is neutralizing the endorsing effect of displaying text. I think that is a very workable text in a context like this where we're talking about the posting of core religious texts.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would you explain why you distinguish text and symbolize them? You distinguish text from the crucifix and so on. Why?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does depend entirely on context, to be sure, but symbols are subject to alternative interpretation. Text is not. Or text rarely is. And text such as this, religious text, cannot be seen as anything other than the revealed Word of God. I mean, here we have 120 words in the first four Commandments, 142 in the first five Commandments of this display that is a profound, detailed explication of core religious content, core religious meaning.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understand the text part but why not adopt the same test for the symbols? For example, why not adopt it for the Moses? The burden would be on the government to show that it was not approving, endorsing, et cetera, and in this context, that would be pretty easy. Why not have the same test?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Friedman. Mr. Staver, you have about three minutes left.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5375 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, the argument before this Court was unlike anything that went down in the District Court or the Circuit Court of Appeals because never was a resolution ever mentioned. Never did the District Court or the Sixth Circuit ever discuss the resolution. It was not mentioned in this Court until this answer brief by respondents was filed. It is not part of the District Court's decision, it was not part of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The District Court said that what imprinted every action thereafter with defiance in a taint is the mere posting of the first display. There was no resolution for that display, none is needed. There is no resolution for the foundations display.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5376 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was there a resolution, Counsel?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ For the second display, yes, Your Honor, there was.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And whatever is in the record is that resolution?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is that resolution but it is specific to the second display because it specifically mentions what kind of documents are in that display. It is not a general display regarding posting of documents. In this case, when of the Court --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But is it correct that it was not amended when the third display was created?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was not amended because it was not -- it was relevant and fact-specific in the display itself.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is the last expression of the governing body's intent?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. What's the last expression is the foundations display which clearly a reasonable observer would see. And if there is any doubt regarding --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there hasn't been a new resolution.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is not a new resolution.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that one wasn't rescinded?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That one died, Your Honor, with the Court's ruling.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was adopted and it still is there, presumably?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Presumably. There is nothing in the record that suggests what happened to it. Whether it was repealed or not. But it was specific factually only to that second display, not to the foundations display which the District Court found was fundamentally different. And if there is any doubt regarding the history of purpose, we would suggest, Justice O'Connor, your suggestion in the Wallace, that if there is any doubt regarding purpose, to look to the effects prong. And I think when you look to the effects prong, a reasonable observer will see that this is a constitutional display. This case is one in which the Sixth Circuit drew the most difficult hate, it imposed it in a subsequent action in the most difficult area of the establishment clause and clearly the public officials have substantially and fundamentally changed. They can't live under this taint forever. They tried but they could to correct their way. They tried what they could to display this in a constitutional manner so that anyone passing by would see this as one document among many others. In addition to the display itself, with all the other hundreds of documents that are on the wall, this display has a specific stated purpose.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So presumably these things are open if it goes on to the final hearing? The preliminary injunction stage?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, the preliminary injunction. And the fact that the resolution is technically latent on the books, they are will repeal that, they repudiate that resolution. Thank you.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. The case is submitted.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CLERK OF COURT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The honorable Court is now adjourned until Monday next at 10 o'clock.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5397 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We will now hear argument in Exxon Mobil against Saudi Basic Industries. Mr. Coleman, I trust you will soon tell us why the case is not moot or whether you think it's moot, and if -- if not, why not.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5399 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Good morning, Justice Stevens. May it please the Court: I will begin with that, if you would like. This case is not moot because there is an ongoing case or controversy between the parties. There is a judgment, it is true, from the Delaware State court, which has now been affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court. But preclusion doctrines not Rooker-Feldman and not mootness govern the resolution of the claims that we asserted first --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what financial interests do your clients have to keep litigating today in another court?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know the --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What's going on? I mean, it's very confusing.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, certainly, Justice O'Connor, we've not yet recovered on our judgment and that judgment is still there. It is still in existence. We've not yet collected on it. But I don't believe that mootness turns on whether you have, in fact, collected on a judgment. There are very few cases out there in which a party has, in fact, obtained two judgments, one from a State court and one from a Federal court, usually because a party waived the application of preclusion doctrines. And -- and we have conceded previously that that's not our interest. What is our interest here is that we have asserted Federal jurisdiction. This case was brought in Federal court by SABIC. During the course of discovery, we found some things out that they had been overcharging us and we indicated that we were going to bring claims against them in Federal court. They ran down to Delaware court by forum shopping in order to try to obtain a shorter statute of limitations, which turned out for them to be a strategic blunder of monumental proportions. But the Federal case, when we filed it, those claims had original jurisdiction in Federal court. They have not yet been resolved in a proper way. We --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But do you have a continuing case or controversy? That was -- that -- that's a bedrock Article III requirement, and if you've got all the relief that you were seeking -- let's put it this way. Suppose your opponent SABIC says, here's the check for the $417 million and we undertake that we're not going to pursue any further relief. Would you have a case or controversy left?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. We might not have an interest in pursuing the case, but we have a legal interest in terms of Article III case or controversy. It is well established that the -- the fact of taking a judgment does not make a case moot. In fact, if there were a holding that we think that the Federal case were moot --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if you've got all the relief to which you are entitled, that does make a case moot.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In terms of cases that involve injunctive relief where it is impossible for a court to give you the relief that you have -- that you are seeking, that is true. But when you are seeking money damage, it is at least theoretically possible -- we're not saying that we're going to ask for that, but at least theoretically possible that the Federal district court could still give us relief. And therefore, what we are asking for is --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What relief could it give you?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what for?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What relief? If you're paid in full, what -- what relief are you entitled to?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we think the relief that we're entitled to, in terms of this, is for the case to be remanded for the district court to resolve these issues under preclusion doctrines.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what issues would -- would the district court resolve?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Preclusion.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if you win on the preclusion --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Who cares?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- what do you get then in substance?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't necessarily intend to take a -- another judgment in Federal court.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then what do you intend to do? If you win on preclusion, what do you do then?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, hopefully we'll win on preclusion with respect not only to this suit, the New Jersey II suit, but also the New Jersey I suit, which we say the district -- or the Delaware judgment precludes.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think we'd like an answer. Justice Ginsburg gives us -- gives you a hypothetical case. You've got the money. The judgment has been discharged in the State courts. What is left to do in the Federal court?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is likely --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, the one answer I heard you give, well, we're interested in preclusion to say -- well, that's all historical at that point. Who cares?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it is likely, Your Honor -- and we have previously said -- that we may very well dismiss the case of our own accord. But that doesn't mean --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We're looking for -- we're looking for something that makes the case live.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our claims are alive. There are claims there that seek relief --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But we're -- we're questioning why that is and we're asking you what relief you need to get that you wouldn't get in the hypothetical that Justice Ginsburg posed.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We thought we would not seek further monetary relief.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So what --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you know how many claims in this case that -- that were not in the Delaware case?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5430 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We have affirmative defenses to the New Jersey I, but -- but the claims in New Jersey II and Delaware are the same, Your Honor.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is your answer that you might want equitable relief, an injunction to continue making payments in the future, or something like that?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. We're not seeking additional monetary or equitable relief.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You -- you would be stuck anyway because you made a counterclaim and -- and it would be -- on which you prevailed. And in that counterclaim you would be precluded if you didn't ask for everything that you could get. But -- but at this stage at least, the -- the door -- there -- there is still conceivably an avenue of further litigation because, SABIC hasn't yet said that it's not going to do anything more, that it isn't going to petition for cert, for example.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And, indeed, Your Honor. I mean, SABIC has represented to the Court that it likely intends to seek certiorari relief from this Court in the Delaware suit.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So it has --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So if they do, it's not finished.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is not finished --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, all right. I'll ask them that.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Getting back to the Rooker-Feldman issue, which is the issue on which the Court granted cert, Rooker-Feldman is a narrow, limited doctrine, but it bars only appellate review not parallel litigation in Federal district courts. Rooker-Feldman is not a theory of vanishing original jurisdiction, nor is it a jurisdictional substitute for the preclusion analysis mandated by Congress in the Full Faith and Credit Act. The expansive interpretation asserted by SABIC misperceives the fundamental nature of appellate review. It's untethered to any natural negative implication in 28 U.S.C. 1257. It illegitimately displaces the application of section 1738, the Full Faith and Credit Act, in most cases to which it is traditionally applied, and it serves absolutely no useful purpose.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the problem that bothers me -- and I don't know that there's an answer to it -- is you have plaintiff. Plaintiff goes into State court. He brings a lawsuit, a tort suit, a contract suit. And then he decides he'd also like to go to Federal court. He brings exactly the same suit. And here we have two suits and exactly the same thing running along at the same time. Now, I know there are principles from this Court's case law that says, well, that's what's supposed to happen. They've always bothered me. But now let's take a special instance. The special instance is that in court one in the State, the plaintiff loses. Now, what he decides to do is to say to the Federal court, we want you to review what they did in the State court. Can't do that. Right?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. So he brilliantly figures out I will omit the word review from my -- from my motion. I will ask for precisely the same thing just not use that word review. I will ask them to go and make their decision which happens to be -- in my opinion should be -- 100 percent the opposite of what the State court did showing they're wrong. But I won't use the word review. Now, you say because he cut the word review out, he can do it.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Breyer. It's not because he cut the review out. Rooker-Feldman is an issue of appellate -- the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. So what does appellate jurisdiction mean? Well, appellate --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Coleman, would you clarify, I think, in response to Justice Breyer's inquiry? Rooker-Feldman both involved State court litigation that was over and done with. Then you come to the Federal court. You have two parallel cases would be -- brought within a month of each other?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Within 2 months of each other. Within a month of each other, Your Honor.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And isn't the standard defense of the person who has started the other suit first, well, Your Honor, prior action pending, please hold the case that started second in abeyance till we get done? And if we win in the first case, then it will be precluded. Then the second case -- the parallel case will be precluded. That's not Rooker-Feldman territory.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's -- that's -- Your Honor, that's our position that -- concurrent jurisdiction is a separate issue from the appellate review issue that Rooker-Feldman raises. Justice Breyer, the answer to your hypothetical is that appellate review is something different from having a parallel action. Appellate review is probably best defined by two characteristics that I'll try to flesh out for you. The first is that the proponent alleges some sort of injury-causing error by the trial court and not by the adversary and then seeks an order reversing, vacating, or otherwise nullifying that lower court order. When a party alleges an injury by his adversary rather than the trial court, the most that can really be said is that you are continuing on a parallel litigation but not that you are seeking appellate review. You do not have what looks like appellate review. You're not alleging errors by the lower court. You're not seeking an order that directly nullifies or otherwise undoes the State court judgment.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but the argument -- it seems to me the argument is that in a de facto sense, when you try to litigate the Federal case, after losing the State case, you in effect are asking the Federal court in some sense to review what happened in the State court. Justice Ginsburg's answer to that is preclusion is the answer. Is that your answer?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because if that -- if that is -- if we accept that as the answer, then there's no argument for saying you should expand Rooker-Feldman to include the de facto review as opposed to the -- the very strict sense of review that you're talking about.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is absolutely our position, Justice Souter, that preclusion addresses all of these issues.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but can you -- can you expand on this a little? I'm not taking a view on it. I'm trying to clear up what's a confusion in my mind. I see how you could do this on the parallel business with -- with delaying it on the docket and using the doctrine of preclusion. I understand that. But we've still got this doctrine called Rooker Feldman out there, and as long as you have that doctrine, it strikes me as odd if -- say, it weren't a plaintiff. Say it was the losing party, you know, that was asking the Federal judge, Judge, you have this case on your docket. Let's move it up. Let's decide it now. He doesn't use the word review, but everything else is the same. He wants a decision out of that court that is going to be the opposite of what the State court did. And what's concerning me -- maybe I shouldn't be concerned, but what's concerning me is whether he can get it or not seems to turn completely on whether he uses the word review in the petition.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't -- I don't think that that is true. It should not and does not turn on the words that you use in your petition. What it turns on is the fundamental nature of the injury that you claim and of the relief that you seek. One reason why you don't need to be necessarily concerned about this is that in all of these cases in which one case has gone to judgment and there is a -- either a continuation or a new case, preclusion is going to cover these. The only extension of Rooker-Feldman that SABIC is asking for is what they call the actually litigated test. That is the heart of the Full Faith and Credit Act.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Rooker-Feldman, if I understand it correctly, is a subject matter jurisdiction bar. Is that --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. It --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. And --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- it arises from a negative implication taken from section 1257 and a second negative implication from 1331.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, to -- so if the two lawsuits, the State court suit and the Federal suit -- they're proceeding concurrently or one is held in abeyance waiting the other, there is certainly subject matter jurisdiction in the Federal court of the Federal action.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To apply Rooker-Feldman in that context would say you had subject matter jurisdiction at the outset, but then you lost it somewhere down the line.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and -- yes, Justice Ginsburg. And that's a distinction between your hypothetical and Justice Breyer's. Justice Breyer's, as I -- if I understand it correctly, is that the Federal suit starts after the State court is done. Yours is where you have parallel actions at the same time. And where the Federal claims are parallel or even filed first, as in our case, you can't say that the moment you file those that you're seeking review of some nonexistent State court judgment. You're simply asking for relief from something that your adversary did to you. And the argument that SABIC makes that the court relinquishes jurisdiction has no basis or justification in anything this Court has ever said. It is a theory of vanishing jurisdiction that I cannot understand.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Coleman, can I interrupt with a question?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it your position that what should have been done in this case, not in the hypothetical case, is the trial court should have just stayed the action pending the outcome of the Delaware case?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And, in fact, that's what the Federal district court had done, Your Honor.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that's what -- he did -- that was correct.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And then when the Delaware case was over, then what should he have done?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we could either ultimately dismiss it or the Federal district court could say, looks like your Delaware case is over. SABIC brings a motion --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and he has given you all the relief your entitled to. Therefore, you go ahead and dismiss the case.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, or SABIC brings a motion --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And therefore, my next question is why shouldn't we do exactly that now.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because the question before the Court today is a question of jurisdiction, not of practical consequences other than the mootness question that SABIC has raised. But practical consequences are that what we may --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, maybe we could vacate the judgment of the court of appeals, say that was wrong, but still, order it dismissed after we vacate the judgment.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think, as in Feldman, that's a question that should be first addressed by the district court. Certainly we hope that you will vacate or reverse the Third Circuit's judgment and allow the district court to address those issues. Perhaps we dismiss it.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if you don't tell us what issue remains, I don't know why we shouldn't just direct the suit to be dismissed.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There -- there is a live -- in -- in the terms of Article III, there are live claims that remain pending before the district court. And while it is true --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I take it that's because you don't have the cert period expired yet in the first action and you don't have the check.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At the very minimum --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. It's -- if the 3 months is expired and the check is in your hand and it's certified, what's left?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As a practical matter, we have no intention. As a jurisdictional matter, there's still --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not asking about your intention. Let's assume you do intend to litigate further. What for?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If we did intend to litigate further, SABIC would be entitled to go to the district court and say they can't. They are precluded.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I want -- I want an answer to my question. What are you going to litigate for? What's left?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, again, setting aside our intentions and hypothetically, there are cases in which --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm talking about your case. What's left?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- we do not seek -- will not seek any further review from the district court.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Nothing is left.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, suppose you don't have the check. What's left?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the case is still up in the air.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You have a judgment.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the case -- the case is not over. Indeed, because the State --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I never heard of a case that isn't over until you get the check. I thought the case is over when you have the judgment. (Laughter.)
03-1696 +++$+++ 5498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And then if they don't give you the check, you have a different matter. We have to get it enforced.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is a different matter. But as a matter of Article III jurisdiction, Your Honor, the -- the mootness doctrine does not apply to a situation where you have a judgment and it doesn't necessarily apply the moment you get paid.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose that you lost in the State court and the judgment is final. You then go to Federal court. Are -- is there a context in which Rooker Feldman might then be applicable? This is all hypothetical.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our argument is that it would be applicable only if the injury that we claimed in our Federal suit was an injury caused by the State court -- the court itself or the judge rather than our adversary and we sought relief from that judgment. That would obtain the nature of appellate jurisdiction rather than we say, well, SABIC did us wrong, we'd like a judgment. And then SABIC can come in and say, well, they're precluded. They already tried that.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In other words, if you had some ongoing relation and, in this hypothetical, the State court ruled against you and you went in to try to reverse that ruling, that would be -- that would Rooker-Feldman.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. If we alleged harm from the court and sought relief from the court's judgment.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5504 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There were only the two cases, Rooker and Feldman, that established this.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5505 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Has this Court ever said anything to suggest that Rooker-Feldman, as apart from preclusion doctrine, applies to parallel litigation instead of you go into Federal court after the State court is over and you're trying to undo what the State court did?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think this Court has ever held any such thing, and I think it would be inconsistent with at least Feldman itself. The idea of -- of appellate jurisdiction over the constitutional claims in Feldman that were held not to be barred comes down in the end -- SABIC says, well, those claims weren't actually litigated. But the opinion itself on page 467 points out that the Mr. Feldman had raised his constitutional claims in front of the D.C. Court of Appeals in terms of asking for his waiver. And when I checked the oral argument transcript from the Feldman case, it was mentioned specifically in terms of Mr. Feldman had raised the constitutional claims in front of the D.C. Court. And that's on pages 9, 14, and 16 of the LEXIS version of the oral argument transcript.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there's no preclusion unless they're also decided.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Well, yes. The district court could then decide whether in fact they were precluded, and -- and it's likely that they were. I didn't follow up on what happened when the case went back down on remand. But the Court said, we're not going to decide that. We will allow the district court to address that in the first instance. And so we think that the actually litigated revision of Rooker-Feldman is simply inconsistent with Feldman itself, that it improperly displaces full faith and credit that is not true to the negative implication from section 1257 which has to be a very narrow implication, indeed, because 1257 gives this Court jurisdiction, and it's only appellate jurisdiction, to suggest that another court doesn't have that appellate jurisdiction must be -- must be narrowly limited to the context, the type of lawsuits that this Court would seek, which is not simply they did me wrong, please -- please give me money, but rather, that lower court erred. It violated my rights. It is structurally or in some -- in violation of Federal rights or something that the court did and that you have been asked to fix. That, we think, is consistent with the proper negative implication from 1257, but overrunning most of preclusion law simply is not. For these reasons, we would ask the Court to reverse. And, Justice Stevens, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You may do so. Mr. Castanias. I hope you'll tell us also whether you think the case is moot before you're through.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5512 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case is moot. There is nothing for Exxon Mobil to get at this --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you're still asking for cert.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right, and that's --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, then why is it moot? Because something could happen. We might get this case in theory, take it on cert, and discover a jurisdictional problem that somehow destroys the case without a decision, and should that happen, there luckily for them they have this other case going. So as long as -- you're prepared, I take it, to say you're going to ask for cert. If that's what you're going to say, I don't see how the case is over. It's up to you.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. Well, I'm -- I'm not going to take the Hobson's choice, Your Honor, but I am going to tell you, first of all, that SABIC is going to apply for cert. At least that's my current understanding. And second of all, that shows why this case is not justiciable at this point because if the most likely event in the -- in the event of this Court's review of the Delaware determination, is a reversal on a statute of limitations problem. That's the reason this suit was brought as the, quote, insurance policy that the Third Circuit identified, which was if the Delaware Supreme Court or the Delaware Superior Court had kicked this suit on the ground of the 3-year statute of limitations -- and if you look at page 20a of the supplemental brief, the corrected supplemental brief that we filed with the Court, including the Delaware Supreme Court's opinion, you'll see that they had a whale of a time getting over the plain language of their own statute.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. If for -- somehow you won on that, even though it sounds a little like a State law issue, but nonetheless, if you won on that and they reversed it as a statute of limitations, then what they're saying is, well, that's just why we filed in Federal court. We didn't want the Federal court to review the State court. We wanted our Federal court suit as an insurance policy in case something goes wrong with the State court suit. It has nothing whatsoever to do with Rooker-Feldman. It is parallel adjudication, just what he said. Now, what's your response?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My response, Justice Breyer, is twofold. First of all, with regard to the mootness question, if that eventuality occurs, that's the time when there may be a justiciable issue for a Federal district court. Not now. We've been talking about ifs and hypotheticals and what may happen in the future.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Castanias, was there a proper case in the district court when the complaint was initially filed there some 2 months after you filed in Delaware?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We've never disputed that, Justice Ginsburg.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. So you can bring two cases, identical cases, in two different courts, and that's an everyday thing, and the defense is prior action pending.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, you are urging that Rooker-Feldman which this Court never applied when you had parallel litigation be extended into a domain which is ordinarily taken care of by preclusion doctrine. Why would you want to mix those two things up that now seem to me rather clear, that if you have Rooker-Feldman, when you rush into a Federal court and say, Federal court, undo that State court judgment, I don't like it? Rooker was just a paradigm case of that. Why would you want to spread that doctrine? What is -- what is there that preclusion doctrine doesn't accomplish?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, preclusion doctrine may accomplish this in a certain number of cases, but I think it's important -- and I think I have to correct my colleague on the other side here with regard to the state of the record. Yes, there was a stay of the New Jersey II trial court litigation, but it wasn't because of the Colorado River application that we made. In fact, if you'll look in the appendix to the petition --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm not talking about anything fancy like Colorado River. Prior action pending is a familiar defense. You've got two actions. They could even be in different districts of the same State and one says, Your Honor, this case started second, the other one is going forward, hold it abeyance because there's a prior action pending. That's not Colorado River abstention or anything like that.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, you will see that that is a component of Colorado River, and that was part of the application that we made to the district court in this case under Colorado River. And my only answer -- the only reason that I'm bringing this up, Justice Ginsburg, is that if you'll look in the appendix to the petition for certiorari, you will see that SABIC, my client, made an application for Colorado River abstention, and the district court denied that. The district court denied that in this case.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, sometimes district judges rule incorrectly, but -- but what happened here is the district court case did not go on because the two of you, both sides, said, okay, the district court -- they're all bollixed up with this Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act, so we're going to agree. You agreed that the case would go forward in Delaware, the trial in Delaware. Is that not so?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it was -- it was -- if you'll look at -- I believe this is at page 8a of the addendum to the red brief. You'll see that it was Exxon Mobil that pushed in Delaware, but that actually happened before the ruling on sovereign immunity, that -- that they elected to go forward in Delaware.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, when you say they pushed in Delaware, you brought them into Delaware and a -- in a reverse suit. You wanted a declaration of non liability.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They brought their case for liability in the Federal forum. They were forced by you into the Delaware forum, and now you're saying you were pushed, that Exxon pushed. You brought the case in Delaware. They didn't.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We -- that is true that we brought the initial case, but the case was eventually tried on their counterclaims. The case was inverted to make them the party plaintiff. They went first at trial and is it -- at the page I cited to you, that was where they decided to go forward with the Delaware case.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it was your preferred forum, not theirs. When they filed their complaint, they filed it in New Jersey where they had a related case pending. So you chose the forum.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- that is absolutely the case with regard to the Delaware matter. But I think what your question is getting at -- and I think I have to go back a couple of minutes in our colloquy here to talk about why abstention won't do the work in this case. In the lion's share of cases, it probably will, Your Honor, but in this case it didn't. And this brings me back to Justice Breyer's question which said -- in which he said that -- that concurrent jurisdiction has always bothered him because what you're ending up with is a race to judgment. But it's important again, Justice Breyer. It's a race to judgment.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's -- you see, Justice Ginsburg answered that. I -- I mean, she wasn't answering my question, but she did say what was a perfectly satisfactory approach, that -- that the second person says, you know, Judge, there's another one pending and the judge says, okay, we'll let that go first except in some unusual instance.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which happens thousands of times in -- in all of the courts. It's very common and I don't know why we're over-designing this vehicle. It's simply other action pending. End of case.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Kennedy --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Or end of argument, not end of case. (Laughter.)
03-1696 +++$+++ 5539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So why isn't it that the end? I mean, here it's not moot. They filed the other action. You point out that you not only think something could wreck the State claim, you would love it to wreck the State claim. And -- and therefore, they have this insurance policy in Federal court which they'll gear up if and when the State claim does get wrecked as you hope.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, I think this is the point in the argument where I want to turn to the definition of review as this Court has -- has put it forth in cases like ASARCO. This is a case that Exxon Mobil dismisses in their reply brief as mere dictum. I don't think that this -- the discussion of Rooker-Feldman and the ASARCO case can be dismissed as dictum in that it was a specific response to a specific proposal by the United States appearing as amicus to dismiss the case for lack of standing and instead remit plaintiffs to pursuing a second suit. In that case, the Court wrote that to re adjudicate -- and I'm quoting here from the opinion, and I don't have the particular page here -- to re-adjudicate the very same issues that were determined in the State court proceedings would be -- again quoting -- in essence, an attempt to obtain direct review of the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in the lower Federal courts. In ASARCO, there was no reference to what the intent of the plaintiffs was. There was no reference to what the timing of the lawsuits was. It was simply that identical issues actually litigated.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So perhaps the Court, if it had been more cautious, would have spoken not in terms of Rooker-Feldman or review, but in terms of this matter has been decided. It is claim-precluded. That's what preclusion doctrine is supposed to do. So in that context, maybe this Court used the wrong word. Maybe it should have said, you litigated it, it's over and done with, now it's precluded. Why do you need to interject the word review? Isn't that -- unless you're going to say every time court A decides a case and then you're in court B and someone is raising the same claim, that is a review of court number one rather than you're precluded in court two because of what is -- has been litigated and decided in court one.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, first of all, Justice Ginsburg, I'm hesitant to say that this Court was incautious in its use of words. This was --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is sometimes.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- understandably, but -- but with regard to -- with regard to Rooker-Feldman, it was not just -- it was not just an accidental -- incidental invocation of it. It was the reason for the rejection of the argument. The reason was not res judicata. The reason was respect for the dignity of the State court's work in the case, and that's ultimately --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's why one has preclusion because you are giving respect, full faith and credit, to a decision elsewhere. That's what preclusion doctrine is all about. We respect the judgment of the court that rendered it. We, therefore, give it full faith and credit. That's what preclusion doctrine is about, is about respect and credit. Isn't that so?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's -- that's -- that is -- that is generally right, Justice Ginsburg, but at the same time, there -- we all agree -- Exxon Mobil, SABIC, and the decisions of this Court -- that there has to be some overlap with regard to Rooker-Feldman and SABIC -- and -- excuse me -- and -- and preclusion doctrine. The -- the argument made by Exxon Mobil, which is, in essence, the same question you're asking me, would have destroyed any reason whatsoever for the Rooker and the Feldman cases, as well as the ASARCO case. There's also a significant body of law that's body of law that's been built up over the last 85 years in the lower courts in -- in this regard. And --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So some of the lower courts have given a broad interpretation to Rooker-Feldman and have turned it into something other than the narrower view of it. And I think that's why we granted cert in this case, to decide whether to give it a broad or a narrow interpretation. The Third Circuit applies a rather broad interpretation of it.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I guess in that respect, Justice O'Connor, I disagree because the Third Circuit, admitted by its own words, applies a very narrow version of Rooker-Feldman. And, in fact, using this case as the vehicle to decide this, the -- the definition of Rooker-Feldman in this instance amounts to no more than barring jurisdiction in a second Federal suit over the identical claims. This is not a case where you have to worry about claims that might have been brought, the sort of things that footnote 16 in Feldman dealt with.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But maybe that isn't a proper application of Rooker-Feldman where the complaint is not about something the State court has improperly done.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It isn't. And so in that sense, the Third Circuit has a rather broader view of it I'd say.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, to be sure, Justice O'Connor, the Third Circuit's view is broader than that which appears to be adopted by the Ninth Circuit, as well as the Seventh Circuit. And I think this brings me back to the definition of review. The -- the Ninth and Seventh Circuits' views in our estimation are wrong because they strictly look to the subjective intent of the plaintiff and as to whether the plaintiff is, in fact, seeking reversal. That -- that's the term that's used in these cases. Noel says seeking to set aside. But section 1257 --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course, that's the language that was used in both Rooker and Feldman too I think.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's because, Justice Stevens, that's -- that was the particular fact pattern of this -- of that case.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's the only fact pattern any of our cases have dealt with.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's -- in the Supreme Court, that's right.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the -- and the concern is I think -- at least as I understand the -- the concern with it, it -- it boils down to something like this. Somebody comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion. Don't apply it because, for whatever reason, there's this -- there's something wrong here, and -- and Federal court should determine the -- in fact, the -- the claim preclusion of the State judgment should not apply. The answer to that is, look, that's an issue to be raised by way of appeal of your State judgment. You don't appeal State judgments in Federal court. Out. There's no such claim being made here. The only claim that's being made here or the only conceivable claim, I guess, that can be made here is that we might want to do some litigating in the Federal case after the State case is over. There's no claim here that claim preclusion should not apply in that instance, and because there's no such argument that claim preclusion does not apply, the answer to the problem that you're worried about is simply claim preclusion doctrine. There's no reason to add a perihelion or something onto Rooker-Feldman to deal with what is really a very simple problem and that is, if they try to relitigate anew in Federal court, as Justice Ginsburg says, you -- you plead claim preclusion. Simple. Why do we need to complicate it beyond that simplicity?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Souter, I -- I don't have any qualms with the application of claim preclusion here. The -- the Third Circuit, though, was being -- was being sensitive to the interests of the State courts, as well as sensitive to the fact that it had another jurisdictional issue in front of it, which was subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA. And I'm -- I'm certain, as certain can be, that that court would have reached the same result if res judicata had been before it. But the -- the fact is that Rooker-Feldman is there and, again, as -- as with my response to Justice Ginsburg earlier, your -- your question would effectively rub out any need for even Rooker and Feldman themselves.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, no, because the -- it -- it would not rule out the need to have some answer when someone in a Federal court comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion, whatever the reason may be. Don't apply the claim preclusion rules. There's something unfair about doing it here. The answer to that is, look, what you're really asking us to do, when you say don't apply claim preclusion, is to review what happened in the State court, and we don't sit as an appellate court on State courts. So there's still something for Rooker Feldman to do on, as it were, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg's claim preclusion argument.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Souter, I think again, with respect to the hypothetical that you've put to me, the claim preclusion is appropriately --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5562 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It'll get the -- it'll get the job done that you say will need to be done if you get to that point.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it should get the job done.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why won't it?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5565 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there -- there are -- first of all, there are no guarantees. The -- the preclusion doctrines are -- are riddled with exceptions.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5566 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then -- then you --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5567 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The preclusion doctrine --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then -- then you appeal. Don't ask for a new body of law. Just say, look, you got the application of claim preclusion wrong in this case. We're going to appeal.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I disagree, Justice Souter, that -- that we're asking for anything like a huge, new body of law or that the Third Circuit was making a huge, new body of law.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you're asking us to extend Rooker-Feldman beyond where this Court has taken it, and if I recall correctly, you really didn't ask for this. The Third Circuit injected Rooker-Feldman into the case. Is that not true?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's true, Justice Ginsburg, but it's true because of the briefing cycle. When we briefed the case, there was no Delaware judgment. And it was only on the eve of oral argument --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ms. Castanias --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- could -- could I come back to mootness? One -- one could say that not only is claim preclusion the answer to Rooker-Feldman, it's also the answer to the asserted mootness here. I mean, you -- you don't have to move to dismiss it as moot. All you have to do is move to dismiss because of a prior adjudication that has resolved this question. Do you know of any case in which the existence of a prior judgment in another court has been held to render a suit that someone wants to press to get a second judgment moot? I mean, you'd think there would be a case on that, and I suppose the reason there isn't is that because the other side is always going to plead res judicata.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, or the other side is going to give up.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Or give up. But is there any case in which mootness is established by the fact that there is a prior judgment of another court giving you what you are asking for from this Court?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, in the -- in the realm that we're talking about here, the Fourth Circuit's decision in the Friedman's case came to a mootness conclusion. We've also cited in our brief -- and I don't recall the names of them off the top of my head -- two cases in which the Court either -- either dismissed or remanded for consideration of mootness in light of another State court judgment. So I think there is -- there is a body of law, but I also know that it is -- as recently as yesterday looking at Wright and Miller on this issue, that when complete relief has been accorded by another tribunal, that is the classic case of mootness.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I don't know why -- well, if it's -- if it were so classic, there would be a lot of cases, and I don't -- I'm not sure that any of yours are right on point. And -- and I think the reason is that you don't need it, that claim preclusion is -- is the remedy for the party who wants to get out of it.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, and again, I'm -- I'm certainly not going to fight claim preclusion because this is a suit that should not be here. This is -- this has had moving parts since we -- since the petition was granted with the Delaware Supreme Court ruling and now with yesterday's denial of reargument in the Delaware Supreme Court. What --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is it moot? Or even on -- why does claim preclusion apply? I mean, if you win, from what you've said -- somehow convince us that this refusal to apply the State statute of limitations properly violated some Federal law, let's say -- then that would show that the State statute of limitations applied and barred their claim. Would that be sufficient to knock out the Federal suit too?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not sure I understand the question, Justice Breyer.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, is -- does the State statute of limitations, if -- if it applied to the State's case, does it also apply in the Federal cases, the identical ground that everybody agrees that the State statute governs?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the -- there could be -- there could be issue-preclusive grounds on such a ruling, Justice Breyer, but -- but --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, if you -- if you win, then -- then -- if you win your State case, because of the argument you made, do you also automatically win the Federal case? Is it the same issue?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I don't think I could say that at this point because --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it may not be the same issue. Then -- then they say, okay, it's not going to be claim preclusion, and you'd have to say insofar as it's not the same issue, it's not claim preclusion. And therefore, they could proceed with their Federal case, which is what they want to do I guess.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and that is a future event.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. So we can't say it's moot in any -- and we can't say there's an alternative basis where they'd win, can we? I mean, I'm saying -- I'm thinking if we get into conference, we're discussing this case, and I say, well, I have to think this through, is it the case that if you're right and you end up winning in this Court, that their case in Federal court is over? I think no, it may not be. The answer is it may not be. Then this is not moot at all. This is not claim-precluded at all. They then might proceed with their Federal claim.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I guess, Justice Breyer --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that right or not?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think it's right.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and I think the reason it's not right is because that just shows that there's no live controversy right now. That's a controversy that might happen in the future.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, well, but that -- that isn't fair to them because, for all I know, they filed the Federal case because there's a different statute of limitations, say, that governs it that will have expired if you don't let them file it by the time -- until this whole thing is over. They just wanted it as protection.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, two answers to that, Justice Breyer. First of all, that seems to be a -- a place for State doctrines of tolling to apply, not Federal law. Second of all, this Court in -- in Heck against Humphrey, which we cited in our brief, solves this --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's explaining the unclear by the incredibly hard to understand.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's explaining the unclear by reference to the incomprehensible. But go ahead. (Laughter.)
03-1696 +++$+++ 5599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think I wrote that opinion. (Laughter.)
03-1696 +++$+++ 5600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And indeed, you did, Justice Scalia.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I never did like it. (Laughter.)
03-1696 +++$+++ 5602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I've also gotten that impression. But -- but Heck I think teaches an important -- Heck teaches an important lesson for this case as well, which is that Heck was just a suit for money damages, just like this suit. And -- and yet, this Court said that there's going to be no cause of action under section 1983 because of the intersection of 1983 and habeas. Well, we have the same result here. There should be no Federal court case here because of the intersection of section 1257 --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, because it's where you walk in the door. And you started out by saying this case, I think as you must, was a proper Federal case. It was properly filed in -- and it was properly filed in Delaware. So you can't talk about a case that says, if you've got this kind of case, you go in this door. If that kind of case, you go in that door. You have a case here that could go in either door, the Federal, the State. The usual rule is, is it not, that if Federal jurisdiction attaches, it doesn't get lost because of subsequent events. For example, if a defendant moves into the plaintiff's State and the only basis for Federal jurisdiction is diversity, subject matter jurisdiction isn't lost, is it?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, and in fact, the case that's cited against us for that proposition, the Freeport McMoran case, makes clear, in the portion of it not cited by Exxon Mobil, that that rule is limited to the diversity context. And it's not -- it -- it does not have its genesis in statute, but it's in policy. We don't want to keep people from moving across State lines. We don't want to -- want to impede their -- their free movement. So we're going to look at it at the time of filing. But what we have here is a case where maybe it was original jurisdiction when the case was filed, but it's not original anymore.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Maybe. It's not -- it's not maybe --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, in this case, yes. In this case, yes. But original jurisdiction when the case was filed but not anymore because there's nothing original about it.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ A case can become moot, but we've already expressed considerable doubt whether that is the fate of this case. The notion -- you used it derisively -- the insurance policy. Lawyers bring protective actions all the time, don't they? There's nothing wrong with doing that.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I guess I come back to -- to where I started with Justice Breyer on the -- on the merits of the Rooker-Feldman issue this morning, which is that the concurrent jurisdiction is something to be dealt with. This Court has an uneasy body of law in the abstention area dealing with the issue of concurrent jurisdiction, but what it doesn't have is anything that deals with judgments, once you get to a judgment.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you? It's perhaps an unfair question. The Chief Justice generally likes to confine our attention to cases of this Court rather than the courts of appeals for our primary guidance, and most of the Rooker-Feldman law is court of appeals law, as we -- we both know. Going back just to Rooker and to Feldman, those two cases, and putting aside ASARCO for a minute, which of those two cases do you think provides you the stronger support, if indeed any support, between Rooker and Feldman?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I would have to say that Feldman, of the two of them, is probably stronger support.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5611 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that is the case in which the court of appeals was itself a party to the litigation.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5612 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. But at the same time, the -- the Rooker case also dealt with relitigation of the identical issues. And if I could just sum up here, seeing that the light is on here, the issue in this case is limited to identical lawsuits, identical claims. The Third Circuit's decision in this case, if it constitutes an extension of Rooker-Feldman at all, is only a modest extension because it recognizes, consistent with ASARCO, consistent with Heck, and consistent with the very notion, Justice Souter, of de facto appeals, not actual appeals, but de facto appeals being prohibited by the doctrine -- it recognizes that claims actually litigated in a State suit to a judgment, if they are litigated anew in the Federal court, that is de facto appellate review. The judgment of the Third Circuit should be affirmed.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that depends on who wins.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're right.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5618 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, if you lost in the other suit, your claim here wouldn't be moot. I mean, it -- it would be precluded, but it's certainly not moot.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5619 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I think that's right. I'd also like to address, just very briefly, the ASARCO question. The language that the Court used in there we don't necessarily think was loose or inappropriate, Justice Ginsburg, and the reason was the Court cites at that point an amicus brief by the United States and it cites a particular footnote. And what that footnote says is it's a recommendation that the mining company in that case could file a Federal lawsuit seeking a judgment that the invalidation of the statute was not necessary. But by challenging the invalidation itself, that -- that looks more like a direct challenge to the State court judgment. It's not simply a relitigation. So that behind the Court's language there -- and of course, it was really just addressing standing. It was not directly addressing Rooker-Feldman. But the U.S.'s suggestion in that case was a suit challenging the State court judgment, and in that situation, it looks more like appellate review, more likely to infringe upon Rooker Feldman-type interests. In the end, we believe that preclusion doctrines adequately cover all of this, that it is not true --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5620 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Coleman, I don't mean to take your time, but in the ASARCO case, was the State court judgment final at the time in dispute?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5621 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, there's a question about that. I mean, the Court kept jurisdiction, but there was a determination that the statute was invalidate -- was invalid and then a remand back to the district court for further proceedings.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5622 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because if the judgment were final, then that would fit right into your -- your analysis, if the judgment of the State court were final.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5623 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, it would.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In the -- at the end of the day, we believe that this Court's preclusion jurisprudence is not riddled with vagaries, that it's not difficult to understand, and that it's certainly not more vague or difficult than the borrowing that they are attempting to do to bring existing preclusion doctrines into -- in order to expand Rooker-Feldman. Preclusion is the answer in this case. We believe that the district court should be permitted to address that in the first instance, and we would ask the Court to reverse the judgment of the Third Circuit. Thank you.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Coleman. The case is submitted.
03-184 +++$+++ 5630 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ The Court will now hear argument in Ballard against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Mr. Shapiro.
03-184 +++$+++ 5632 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Judge Cudahy stated in his dissent in the Seventh Circuit that disclosure of the rule 183 report in this case should be required on both statutory and constitutional grounds. As Judge Cudahy put it, there is no item of more significance in evaluating a Tax Court's decision on fraud than the unfiltered findings of the STJ.
03-184 +++$+++ 5633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Shapiro, can this case, in your view, be decided solely on the statutory question?
03-184 +++$+++ 5634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes, Your Honor. We believe it can.
03-184 +++$+++ 5635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There also are due process allegations, and I'm not sure I even quite understand what the precise due process violation is that's alleged. But I would like you to address both and to tell us, first of all, how it would be resolved solely on a statutory basis from your perspective.
03-184 +++$+++ 5636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The readiest ground for decision is the statutory basis, and we believe that the statute is a good means to avoid a complex due process question. There are two statutes that are key here. One is the appellate review statute. The other is the public record statute. The public record statute says all reports of the Tax Court are public records, and we're talking about a report of the Tax Court in this case. The legislative history of that provision shows Congress had the broadest possible intent to make all practices in the Tax Court completely transparent. All steps in the adjudication were supposed to be --
03-184 +++$+++ 5637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, would that include -- if a Tax Court judge had a law clerk, would it include law clerk memos to the judge?
03-184 +++$+++ 5638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- we don't take that position. It refers to reports of judges, and this is a report of a trial judge who heard the witnesses. The report is presumed correct under rule 183. It's the only independent evaluation of witness credibility --
03-184 +++$+++ 5639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, why -- why do you say that?
03-184 +++$+++ 5640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- and the only judge --
03-184 +++$+++ 5641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would you elaborate for this reason? Because the briefs and you again today keep talking about that first document. You use the word report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, to me that's the whole conclusion of the case. I'm prepared to assume, at least for the moment, if you can convince me that that's the report they're talking about, you'd win. But that isn't what the Government says. The Government says that's a piece of paper, preliminary. We -- like my draft. I write drafts all the time. So -- so do trial judges. And he goes and brings the draft to the other two judges and says, let's sit down and talk about it. And they sit down and talk about it, and he changes his mind and writes a different document. And that different document, of course, is totally public. The whole opinion of the Tax Court. There is that document.
03-184 +++$+++ 5644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is only one rule 183 report. Under the rule, it's the report the trial judge prepares and submits to the chief judge at the completion of the trial, which contains his independent credibility findings.
03-184 +++$+++ 5645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do we know that? Now -- now, what is the answer specifically in the statute? Let's call it document 1 and document 2. And it really didn't help me that much in the briefs to see document 1 continuously labeled with the word report when I thought that's the key question. Is it? Is it that report they're referring to? So now, go ahead.
03-184 +++$+++ 5646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under rule 183(b) there is a report denominated as such. There's no question here it was submitted to the court. If you look at page 114a of the Kanter appendix, it says that the special trial judge submitted a report, as required by rule 183(b). And this case was then referred to Judge Dawson. He had no involvement with the case until this report was given to him.
03-184 +++$+++ 5647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which --
03-184 +++$+++ 5648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry.

03-184 +++$+++ 5657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- which is in the Government's brief at 4a? It says, special trial judge's report. It is the only report to which the Tax Court rules refer.
03-184 +++$+++ 5658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor. And it's --
03-184 +++$+++ 5659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and if in fact --
03-184 +++$+++ 5660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- it is presumed correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- you rely on the rule, do we even have to resolve the issue of meaning of report in the statute? Can't we simply, from your position, rely on the rule and say you've got to follow your own rules?
03-184 +++$+++ 5662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely. This is a report that must be submitted. It is presumed correct under this rule. It's an independent evaluation of credibility from the only judge who heard the witnesses, and of course, it's part of the record. And it doesn't --
03-184 +++$+++ 5663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you've really got three arguments. You've got the rule. You've got the statute, and you have due process.
03-184 +++$+++ 5664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it doesn't make the slightest difference that the superior judge caused the subordinate judge to say, I have changed my mind at a later stage in the proceeding, because it is the original report that is presumed correct under the rules.
03-184 +++$+++ 5665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Now, what -- what was the page? Please. You're going quite -- and I want to -- because Justice Ginsburg referred to a statement in the Government's brief that you said yes --
03-184 +++$+++ 5666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, not the Government's brief. The Tax Court rules.
03-184 +++$+++ 5667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's -- that's appendix 4a.
03-184 +++$+++ 5668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 4a of the Government's brief.
03-184 +++$+++ 5669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's the rule.
03-184 +++$+++ 5670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, it's the rule itself, 183(b). And it makes it clear that there must be a report filed with the chief judge. The docket here says that that was done.
03-184 +++$+++ 5671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can you make the argument that -- maybe you can't -- that the special trial judge can go to the Tax Court judge, with the permission of the chief judge, and say, now, here's what -- kind of what I'm thinking? It's not my report, but here's what I'm thinking. And then the -- the Tax Court judge says, well, why don't you have some more findings on X and Y and Z? He says, okay, and then he goes back. Can you make the argument that that first document is not the report?
03-184 +++$+++ 5672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The first -- there is only one --
03-184 +++$+++ 5673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I guess another way of saying it is, do the rules permit any consultation before the report is submitted? I -- I guess that's my question.
03-184 +++$+++ 5674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The rules are silent on that, but Judge Dawson has no involvement in the case until the report is submitted. Then the case is assigned to Judge Dawson, and then he is supposed to review it under a presumptive correctness standard. So it would be surprising if there were consultation of that sort. But what we contend is if there is consultation behind the scenes about credibility determinations, then it is critically important that the report be submitted and made part of the record and not concealed, and that the deferential standard of review be --
03-184 +++$+++ 5675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would -- would that problem be overcome if the special trial judge simply -- if his -- the proceedings before him were simply videotaped and then the reviewing judge, Judge Dawson in this case, could look at the trial proceedings and would have as much of a notion of the credibility of the witnesses as the special tax judge?
03-184 +++$+++ 5676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I suppose that's a possibility, but in Anderson, the Court said absent some procedure like that, the trial judge is uniquely situated to evaluate demeanor and tone of voice, and because of that, great deference has to be given to the independent evaluation of the trial judge. Maybe in a -- in the future the Tax Court would want to use a procedure like that to mitigate the Raddatz problem that they now have.
03-184 +++$+++ 5677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In which case, they -- they might well revise the language of their rule.
03-184 +++$+++ 5678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, they -- they might, and --
03-184 +++$+++ 5679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which currently requires that the finding of facts of the trial judge be presumed to be correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, and after all, we should remember that the Government was supposed to present clear and convincing evidence of fraud in this case, and if there was a flip-flop of this sort going on behind the scenes, leaving no trace in the record, what could be more important to the reviewing court than to know what had occurred at the first stage and the second stage here? If the trial judge found no underpayment and no fraud, which we have reason to believe he did -- three Tax Court judges stated that to us -- if that was -- that was his finding and he found our witnesses to be credible, then an unexplained overturning of that credibility determination with no trace in the record would surely be a candidate for reversal on appeal.
03-184 +++$+++ 5681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let -- let me ask this question, if I may. Suppose the -- a special trial judge hears the witnesses, makes a report. It's assigned by the chief judge to a Tax Court judge, and the Tax Court judge looks it over it and says, you know, before I -- before I really spend a lot of time on this, you really didn't explore these three problems. Would you please do it over again? Is he permitted to do that or is that a violation of the rule that he shall presume the report to be correct?
03-184 +++$+++ 5682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we haven't challenged the conversations as such. We think it is -- it is suspect, however. Under Raddatz, if somebody who has not heard the witnesses is telling somebody who has heard the witnesses, I don't agree or I think you may be wrong in your credibility determination, I'd like you to reconsider that, that's a serious Raddatz problem. And the only cure for that is to make the first report part of the record.
03-184 +++$+++ 5683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm asking if it's a violation of -- of the rule.
03-184 +++$+++ 5684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The --
03-184 +++$+++ 5685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because the -- the rule says a special report shall be presumed to be correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, what you're asking us to do would -- would just solve your problem in this case, and -- and in the future, I suppose they could revise rule 183 as simply not to require a report. There -- there's nothing in the statute that requires this report, is there?
03-184 +++$+++ 5690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's true. They could cease using the STJ's, but --
03-184 +++$+++ 5691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they could -- they could use them, but just say, instead of filing a report, he'll consult with the -- with the deciding judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I suppose that could happen. If there is -- if there is no report written, we couldn't contend it has to be disclosed under these statutes, and that -- that might be. But it -- there could be a Raddatz issue in that scenario that you present, Justice Scalia. If one judge heard the witnesses and the other judge didn't hear the witnesses and -- and the -- the superior judge --
03-184 +++$+++ 5693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they confer with each other. Maybe, maybe.
03-184 +++$+++ 5694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it -- it would be -- it would be quite strange to have credibility determinations made by a judge who had never heard from any of the witnesses.
03-184 +++$+++ 5695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What happens in cases in agencies, you know, where -- where -- suppose the agency itself or a member thereof is going to make a decision, and there might be other members who would hear the witnesses. And I was thinking of that analogy. It's possible. It happens in the Federal Communications Commission where the staff, you know, consults back and forth in ratemaking cases.
03-184 +++$+++ 5696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's hard to find precisely the analogy, but it seems likely.
03-184 +++$+++ 5698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the closest analogy in this Court's decisions is the Morgan II decision.
03-184 +++$+++ 5699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, which gives and takes away.
03-184 +++$+++ 5700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, Morgan II is really on point because there, a subordinate official drafted up findings, proposed findings, didn't serve them on the parties, but did give them to the decision-maker, the agency. And this Court held that was a violation of due process.
03-184 +++$+++ 5701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You have to have an opportunity to refute the information that's going to --
03-184 +++$+++ 5702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-184 +++$+++ 5703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and every administrative body that we know of in the Federal courts and in the State system too -- Chief Judge Vanderbilt pointed that out in the Mazza case. Every State in the Union requires disclosure of these administrative law decisions to the parties.
03-184 +++$+++ 5705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you analogize the STJ to the administrative ALJ. But you might also analogize him to a member of the agency itself, and if you make that analogy, it doesn't become so far-fetched, particularly when you look at Morgan as also not allowing you to probe at what's going on.
03-184 +++$+++ 5706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Well, we -- we've avoided suggesting that any depositions should be taken of -- of judicial personnel here. That's not our view. Our view is simply that the report that was prepared -- it was prepared -- should be made part of the record by virtue of two statutes. There is an appellate review statute, Justice O'Connor, that states quite expressly that Congress expected review to take place here just as it does in the district court, to the same degree, to the same extent, and in the same manner. And in the district court, if an adjunct judge makes a finding of fact, whether it's a master or a magistrate or bankruptcy judge, that is always disclosed to the parties.
03-184 +++$+++ 5707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Shapiro, is there any evidence in this record that the special trial judge in fact changed his report beyond the hearsay affidavit?
03-184 +++$+++ 5708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't know what is contained in that first report. We have heard from three of the judges, including the chief judge of the STJ's, that -- that what happened was that Judge Dawson rewrote the credibility findings. Now, we won't know until we see this. That could be wrong. But -- but it should be part of the record for the court of appeals.
03-184 +++$+++ 5709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Shapiro, on credibility, which you have been emphasizing, are you overstating the case for it? Because credibility is more than just observing the witnesses' demeanor. I mean, Judge Dawson could have said, yes, they -- these witnesses might have looked honest to the special trial judge, but considering this documentary evidence in the record, it's clear to me that what the witness said on the stand was a lie.
03-184 +++$+++ 5710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you'll see in perhaps a dozen situations, he says, I simply don't believe that witness, none of whom he heard. And this is a case where credibility was key. Was there a bribery scheme of the kind that the IRS claimed? Every witness who testified said no, it didn't exist. These are simple investments with the proceeds being paid to the corporations, and yet, the Government's theory was there is some nefarious bribery scheme that every witness denied. And there is no documentary evidence of that. The evidence of the proceeds flowing to these corporations was simply the result of their investing money in real estate deals. And so credibility was the key to this whole case. And the -- the Government, I don't think, can be serious when it tells this Court that this first report is some confidential document, that it's privileged internal deliberative material. For 40 years, the -- the Tax Court made these reports available to the public. It -- they were routinely served on the parties. For 40 years there was no suggestion --
03-184 +++$+++ 5711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would -- would you comment on that? I -- I understood from the brief there was a suggestion that if you prevail, we're going to have a huge volume of -- of printed material that we're not troubled with now.
03-184 +++$+++ 5712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes. That's a post hoc rationale. There was no such explanation when this rule was changed, and there's not a bit of work or a bit of expense resulting from our position. We simply ask for a copy of a report that exists. They can serve it on us electronically. It won't cost them a cent. We're making a very modest request under these statutes and under the Due Process Clause. And there was no explanation --
03-184 +++$+++ 5713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, now, wait. Under the Due Process Clause, I assume you would be asking for more than just access to the report. You -- if -- if you're really relying on Morgan II, he who hears must decide, I think you would be saying that after reading the report, you should have the opportunity to argue to the -- to Dawson here, to -- to the Tax Court judge that the report should not be adopted.
03-184 +++$+++ 5714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we defer to --
03-184 +++$+++ 5715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't that part of your due process case?
03-184 +++$+++ 5716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it really is not. We're asking --
03-184 +++$+++ 5717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You think it satisfies due process just to show you the report, and then --
03-184 +++$+++ 5718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To give -- and make it part of the appellate record. We're not asking for any remand to the Tax Court. If the Tax Court doesn't --
03-184 +++$+++ 5719 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, then -- then you're not relying on Morgan II.
03-184 +++$+++ 5720 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we -- we just rely on that as an example of the need to disclose this at an appropriate juncture.
03-184 +++$+++ 5721 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There wasn't a need to disclose the point that Morgan II made. It was he who hears must decide.
03-184 +++$+++ 5722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in Morgan II, the -- the point was that any -- any proposed findings that are drafted up have to be shared with the parties. Now, there they had to be shared with the parties at the administrative level. We're not going that far. If the Tax Court tells us that they don't want to have that layer of review within the Tax Court, they don't want to receive our comments on the initial report, that's fine with us. We want it to be made part of the appellate record so that the judges who are interested in this and believe it will shed a strong light on the issue of clear and convincing evidence can have this be part of the record. And already the Fifth Circuit has overturned the finding of fraud in this very same case.
03-184 +++$+++ 5723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do -- do I understand that you would be satisfied if the Court simply looked to -- what is it -- 7482(a)(1), the appellate review section, which says that the Tax Court decisions shall be reviewed in the same manner and to the same extent as district court decisions? And that --
03-184 +++$+++ 5724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. We'd be satisfied because that is a sufficient basis to say the record has to include the rule 183 report. And it is not up to the trial court to tell the appellate court what's in the record on appeal. It's up to the appellate court to -- to determine what goes into that -- that record. This -- the case in the Second Circuit on that is IBM v. United States where the Second Circuit analyzed rule 10(a) and said it is not the province of the trial court to dictate to the reviewing court what is in that record. And this Court in --
03-184 +++$+++ 5725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And where is it? It's -- it is specified someplace, but when you review a district court decision in -- in a court of appeals, the -- certainly the magistrate's report would be included, but there's someplace where it lists the contents, some rule that lists --
03-184 +++$+++ 5726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes. It's rule 10(a) and it's -- it's very general. It says that all the original papers in the trial court come before the appellate court, and an original report is an original document submitted in the trial court. And this Court confronted that question in Universal Camera 50 years ago, and the Government made the same arguments then that it's making now and it lost 7 to 2 in that case. It -- it said that the report --
03-184 +++$+++ 5727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Institutional memory. Isn't that -- that's a good institutional memory --
03-184 +++$+++ 5728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It goes back. (Laughter.)
03-184 +++$+++ 5734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's one thing that they can do. They can adopt it, but my question is, do they always adopt and never use -- never use the term modify or reject?
03-184 +++$+++ 5735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, no. They -- they do modify and reject. It's just it's hard to determine, when they are doing that. In the old days --
03-184 +++$+++ 5736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They -- they never say so in their opinion.
03-184 +++$+++ 5737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They don't --
03-184 +++$+++ 5738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They always say that they adopt the trial judge's report. Don't they?
03-184 +++$+++ 5739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. That's entirely correct. And now, in the old days, before they amended the rule, you could compare the two and see what was changed, but now you can't. You can't tell what has been changed. And in this instance, we believe there's been a complete rewrite of that first report, and the appellate courts can't tell what's going on. Was there a reason for doing this? Was deference given? Was some other agenda at work in this decision? No one can tell because it is all off the record.
03-184 +++$+++ 5740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what is -- can I ask you a really esoteric administrative law question, which I have never been able to figure out? It's probably relevant, but I -- this is an agency. That's what -- my great tax professor, Ernie Brown, used to say there is no Tax Court. He says, the Board of Tax Appeals shall be known as the Tax Court. What he meant by that is it's not -- it isn't the Tax Court, just known as. So -- so this is an agency, an administrative agency. So I look to the APA for guidance, and the APA, when you look at the section, says this initial decision can be made by a 556-qualified person. Now, a 556-qualified person can include the agency itself or a member of the agency or an ALJ. Then when you to look at what happens in 557, after that presiding employee makes an initial decision, it says you have to give a chance to the party to respond to the initial decision, which you like, in the case where the presiding employee -- presiding person is a subordinate employee. And so, that's what I was just checking here. And so -- so what's supposed to happen where the presiding person under 556 for that initial or tentative decision is not a subordinate employee, but rather, quote, one or more members of the body which comprise the agency? I've never run into that before. Maybe you haven't. Maybe they didn't mean anything by it, but maybe they did.
03-184 +++$+++ 5741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I haven't either. But the judge here certainly was subordinate and --
03-184 +++$+++ 5742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He was a subordinate employee?
03-184 +++$+++ 5743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, he was.
03-184 +++$+++ 5744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Rather than a member -- is -- is -- if he's a subordinate employee, that's easy. Then the case is easy I think.
03-184 +++$+++ 5745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He -- he is a subordinate because as the Government keeps telling us, the Tax Court judge is the only official spokesman for the court. They get to make the final judgment. And the Tax Court judge reviews what the STJ has done.
03-184 +++$+++ 5746 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ These -- these --
03-184 +++$+++ 5747 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you're -- you're not asserting that the APA governs this.
03-184 +++$+++ 5748 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh --
03-184 +++$+++ 5749 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I'm just looking --
03-184 +++$+++ 5750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't there an express exception for -- for --
03-184 +++$+++ 5751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, and this a court. This is an Article I court, this Court has held. And Congress has created very specific appellate review procedures for this court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the special trial judge has no tenure, does she?
03-184 +++$+++ 5753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. He -- those judges could be terminated at will, including because there is not sufficient work for the judge. They can be terminated on that basis. And that, we think, colors the analysis here for the reasons Judge Cudahy gave. This is not an independent judge. When he is persuaded by his superior to change his mind, it's obvious that he -- in our view, that he's going to be heavily influenced by that. It's a serious Raddatz problem. The only cure is to make this part of the record and to enforce the rule 183 presumption of correctness, which creates a clear error standard of review. I see my time has run out. May I reserve the rest for --
03-184 +++$+++ 5754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, you may, of course. Mr. Hungar.
03-184 +++$+++ 5756 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The central flaw in petitioners' case is that both of the trial court judges responsible for evaluating the evidence in the record reached the same conclusion regarding all of the factual issues.
03-184 +++$+++ 5757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Hungar, before you proceed to your legal argument, I was very curious why the Government is defending this practice because the Government, after all, is on the other side of every case. And aren't there situations where it might be that the special trial judge would call a credibility question in the Government's favor and then the Government loses the case before the Tax Court judge and might like to know, before it goes to the court of appeals, how solid the credibility findings were? I mean, I -- I -- the Government being a party to all these proceedings, why is it satisfied with not knowing what the report of the special tax judge -- special trial judge was?
03-184 +++$+++ 5758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, we do know what the report of the special trial judge was. It is in the record. Judge Couvillion's name is on his report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it is not the report. It is called an opinion. It isn't even called the report, and if you will read 183(b), that describes the report. Does anything else describe the report? And what is this report? There is a report. It is submitted to the chief judge. What would you call that?
03-184 +++$+++ 5760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The report is the -- contains the recommended findings of fact and opinion, analysis of the law and application of the law to the fact, of the special trial judge. The report is the findings of fact plus, quote, the opinion.
03-184 +++$+++ 5761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, what is the 183(b) report?
03-184 +++$+++ 5762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-184 +++$+++ 5763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There --
03-184 +++$+++ 5764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- under rule 183(b), the -- the special trial judge submits his report to the chief judge. It is then referred to a Tax Court judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So that report, the special trial judge's report, is a document prepared by the special trial judge which he gives to the chief judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct. But the important thing to understand, Your Honor, is that nothing in the rule precludes, during the course of the deliberative process that then follows, the special trial judge from concluding that he has made a mistake, that he no longer agrees with the -- the stated findings of fact in that -- in that original report, from withdrawing and submitting a corrected report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that's not the way the rule reads. The rule reads, as I understand it, under (c) that the court itself may accept, reject, or modify. It doesn't say anything about the special trial judge reconsidering and rewriting his report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't preclude it either, Your Honor. There's a longstanding practice --
03-184 +++$+++ 5769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, it does because it -- it goes on to say that due regard shall be given to the circumstance that the special trial judge had the opportunity to evaluate and the findings of fact recommended by the special trial judge shall be presumed to be correct. But if those findings of fact are simply the same findings of fact that he agrees with the rest of the -- the panel on, it just makes no sense at all.
03-184 +++$+++ 5770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The Tax Court judge cannot report in -- in the opinion that is issued by the Tax Court, he cannot say I'm adopting the opinion and findings of the special trial judge if the -- if the Tax Court judge does not agree with those and the -- and the special trial judge adheres to his original decision. The only way it is possible for there to be a change is for the special trial judge himself to determine, in the exercise of his responsibility as a judicial officer, that he made a mistake.
03-184 +++$+++ 5771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What report goes to the chief judge?
03-184 +++$+++ 5772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Originally the original report goes to the chief judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a report. Is that not a report?
03-184 +++$+++ 5774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is a report, Your Honor.
03-184 +++$+++ 5775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why doesn't that -- why isn't that required to be -- to be made public?
03-184 +++$+++ 5776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because if -- because the -- because the Tax Court has determined that it will not be made public, that it is part of internal deliberation.
03-184 +++$+++ 5777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's a report. The statute says that the reports have to be made public.
03-184 +++$+++ 5778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor.
03-184 +++$+++ 5779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is a report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor.
03-184 +++$+++ 5781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it goes to the --
03-184 +++$+++ 5782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor.
03-184 +++$+++ 5783 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No?
03-184 +++$+++ 5784 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With respect, the tax -- the -- the statute says a report of the Tax Court must be made public. A -- a report --
03-184 +++$+++ 5785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but the rule -- the rule says that the first report, the document 1, has to be given deference. Whether it's presumed to be correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Kennedy, if I may, I'd like first to finish my response to Justice Scalia.
03-184 +++$+++ 5787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure.
03-184 +++$+++ 5788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The statutes -- the -- the disclosure requirement applies only to reports of the Tax Court. It is perfectly clear that a report, the original report, or any report of a special trial judge is not and cannot be the report of the Tax Court unless it is first adopted and approved by a Tax Court judge, and then goes through the next step of -- of being submitted --
03-184 +++$+++ 5789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's -- it's very hard to understand how appellate review can function if that first report of the special trial judge is never disclosed. I just don't see how the appellate review can function properly.
03-184 +++$+++ 5790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And how do we know that it was -- that it was presumed to be correct under the rule?
03-184 +++$+++ 5791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. How does the appellate court know whether deference, as required by the rules, was given unless the appellate court can see it? It's such a strange procedure. Why, in answer to Justice Ginsburg, does the government take the view it does? Wouldn't you like to see it if it went against you?
03-184 +++$+++ 5792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We submit, Your Honor, that there is no evidentiary or probative value in an initial conclusion that the -- that the person who reached that conclusion has abandoned, has concluded was wrong. Special Trial Judge --
03-184 +++$+++ 5793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the rule --
03-184 +++$+++ 5794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- Couvillion rejected --
03-184 +++$+++ 5795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the rule -- the rule 183 does provide for a certain degree of deference to be given to those findings of the special trial judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To the recommended findings of the special trial judge. And I submit that if the special trial judge has concluded that his initial recommendations were mistaken because, based upon further consideration as a judicial officer in the exercise of his obligations, he has realized he made a mistake, I submit it would be bizarre to require a Tax Court judge to give some sort of -- of deference to --
03-184 +++$+++ 5797 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Hungar, do you --
03-184 +++$+++ 5798 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- abandoned findings.
03-184 +++$+++ 5799 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you see somewhat of a problem, that we are not dealing here with the relationship between peers? Judge Dawson is appointed, what, for a 15-year term. The special trial judge is appointed by the Tax Court and his job is at the Tax Court's grace. And if you have compared in your brief that relationship to, say, a discussion among colleagues, I think it's worlds different.
03-184 +++$+++ 5800 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, Judge Dawson actually is a senior judge who was recalled. So he doesn't have the 15-year term protection. But it's true that special trial judges are -- are appointed by the chief judge, not by the Tax Court judges, but by the chief judge, so that Judge Dawson wasn't, in a sense, his -- his appointing, employing official. But more to the point, special --
03-184 +++$+++ 5801 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He has had a special -- a -- a long term and he is well-known and respected as a Tax Court judge who was appointed, as all other members of the court were appointed.
03-184 +++$+++ 5802 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Judge Couvillion has been a special trial judge, I think, for nearly 20 years. But the point is special trial judges are bound by the code of conduct. The Tax Court has adopted for both Tax Court judges and special trial judges the same code of conduct that applies to Federal judges under Article III, which --
03-184 +++$+++ 5803 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me --
03-184 +++$+++ 5804 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- obligates independent decision-making.
03-184 +++$+++ 5805 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me that it's very much like, if you have to compare it with something, the relationship between a magistrate and a Federal district court judge. The magistrate also hears testimony, makes a report, findings, and a recommendation. What's the difference between those two?
03-184 +++$+++ 5806 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, one difference is that the district court judges, as I understand it, appoint the magistrate, not the chief judge. But a more significant difference is that the statute and rules applicable to magistrates require disclosure of their reports and do not treat them as part of the internal deliberative process. The Tax Court has determined that it is inefficient to have disclosure of the original report, then have exceptions and have that whole process followed that they used to follow. They have determined that they will treat the Tax Court -- excuse me -- the special trial judge's report --
03-184 +++$+++ 5807 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So where does it say that? Where does it say that?
03-184 +++$+++ 5808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're not requiring the -- this case doesn't involve the question of whether they can make objections to the finding in -- in the special report. It's just whether it's disclosed.
03-184 +++$+++ 5809 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. But the -- but the Tax Court has determined not to disclose it.
03-184 +++$+++ 5810 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I understand. But your argument about how it would make the proceeding more cumbersome, it seems to me, is -- is misplaced.
03-184 +++$+++ 5811 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it certainly would be more cumbersome if they followed the procedure that they used to follow, which we submit, although the record is -- they did not specifically state --
03-184 +++$+++ 5812 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But they're not asking for that. Am -- am I wrong on --
03-184 +++$+++ 5813 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, that's true, Your Honor. What they're asking for here, what they say they want is merely disclosure of the original report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5814 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it's a particularly strong argument in a case -- in several of the issues. I remember Judge Fromm's opinion turned on the credibility of oral testimony, and in one case, Judge Fromm found the -- the judge here made an erroneous ruling on credibility on one issue, if I remember correctly. And it seems to me that's a case in which it would be particularly relevant to know the reasons pro and con on why credibility determinations were made by the person who heard the witnesses.
03-184 +++$+++ 5815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the person who heard the witnesses is Special Trial Judge Couvillion.
03-184 +++$+++ 5816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Has been convinced that he was wrong.
03-184 +++$+++ 5817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the question is, well, what was his -- what was the basis for his original position when you're evaluating whether you've got a valid argument to make on appeal?
03-184 +++$+++ 5819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Under that rationale, Justice Stevens, every time a district court judge changes his mind, after giving further thought to a case --
03-184 +++$+++ 5820 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no.
03-184 +++$+++ 5821 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- before he issues his final opinion --
03-184 +++$+++ 5822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Only if he is required by a rule to make certain findings and to deliver a completed report to someone else.
03-184 +++$+++ 5823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, again, the -- the rule does not preclude the practice. It is a common practice --
03-184 +++$+++ 5824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't forbid it. You're right. It doesn't forbid it in so many words. But I just wonder, does it comport with your normal notions of a fair way to conduct a fair hearing, letting the parties know what the basis for decision was and who thought what about the witnesses and so forth?
03-184 +++$+++ 5825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor. If the -- in a -- when a -- when a court has a collegial deliberative process involving more than one person that is involved in the decision-making -- certainly this is an unusual process in that -- and there is no identical analog, but we see no due process problem.
03-184 +++$+++ 5826 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. But I don't see what is consistent with your notion of a deliberative process as producing the report and the presumption of correctness in the rule. The rule presumes that some original document, which you are treating as provisional, enjoys a presumption of correctness, and I don't see the consistency between provisionality and deliberate character on the one hand and presumption on the other.
03-184 +++$+++ 5827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I may, Your Honor, the rule does not state that the, quote, original report shall receive a presumption of correctness. It doesn't even say that -- that any report shall receive a presumption of correctness. It says the findings of fact recommended by the special trial judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And aren't those findings of fact the findings of fact that are delivered to the chief judge in the report that is made to the chief judge before it is even assigned to a Tax Court judge?
03-184 +++$+++ 5829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not if -- not if the tax -- if the special trial judge has abandoned those recommendations, withdrawn those recommendations, and replaced them.
03-184 +++$+++ 5830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But he hasn't abandoned them at the point that he delivers them to the chief judge, and if that's what this is referring to, then the presumption of the -- of -- of correctness necessarily has to apply to whatever the document is that's delivered to the chief judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it applies to the report, but I submit that if the special trial judge withdraws in order to correct an error in the report, what he submits as the corrected report is then the, quote, report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're -- you're --
03-184 +++$+++ 5833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why isn't that explained in the rules, if that's the process?
03-184 +++$+++ 5834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- have a condition subsequent. It seems to me that you're saying, Mr. Hungar, that the last sentence of 183 is unenforceable.
03-184 +++$+++ 5835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the credibility -- the due regard and presumption of --
03-184 +++$+++ 5836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The presumption.
03-184 +++$+++ 5837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's important to understand also that, in fact, it would violate the Internal Revenue Code. This rule must be construed to be consistent with the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code makes very clear, and this Court held in Freytag, that the Tax Court judge, not the special trial judge, is the decision-maker, the only finder of fact in these kinds of cases under subsection (b)(4) of the statute. This Court so held in Freytag and the -- and the statute makes that very clear. So it would violate the statute to construe this, as petitioners do, to require some sort of deferential clear error review.
03-184 +++$+++ 5838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you're saying the rule itself in that respect is invalid?
03-184 +++$+++ 5839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If construed as petitioners would have it, yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, how else could you possibly construe it? There's no presumption operating at all on your reading.
03-184 +++$+++ 5841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In the tax context, Your Honor, the -- there is a presumption of correctness that attaches to assessments and deficiency notices issued by --
03-184 +++$+++ 5842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but you're saying there is -- there is no presumption of correctness that can operate with respect to the report that goes first to the chief judge because, I understood you to say, to do that would violate the Internal Revenue Code provision that the fact-finder and the only fact-finder is the Tax Court judge. And therefore, I think the implication of what you're saying is that the rule on its face is invalid.
03-184 +++$+++ 5843 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, presumption of correctness does not necessarily equate with clear error, deferential review. That's my point.
03-184 +++$+++ 5844 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm -- I'm not even getting to whatever the standard of review may be. I presume the word presumption means something other than it's there unless you want to change it later after the person who employs you objects to it. It's got to mean something more than that.
03-184 +++$+++ 5845 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What the presumption of correctness means in the tax context, with respect to deficiency determinations and the like, is that the burden of going forward is on the party seeking to change what -- what -- the determination that is presumed correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5846 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there's no party who is seeking to change at this point because the parties don't know what's in it. They're not going forward. This is, as you point out, an internal process that is going on here. So that definition can't apply.
03-184 +++$+++ 5847 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. If -- there -- there are two processes that go on. The Tax Court judge, quite appropriately, we -- we assume and have -- have no reason to disagree, confers with, discusses with the special trial judge. If -- if in the course of that discussion, one or both of them come to the conclusion that something is wrong in the original report and if the special trial judge agrees, the special trial judge has the option of withdrawing his original report, submitting a corrected report, and having the presumption of correctness, whatever it means, apply to his corrected report. If -- if --
03-184 +++$+++ 5848 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In -- in that discussion, does the Tax Court judge have to give great weight to the findings of fact of the -- of the special judge?
03-184 +++$+++ 5849 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor, not great weight because, again, that would violate the statute.
03-184 +++$+++ 5850 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Any weight?
03-184 +++$+++ 5851 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He is to give due -- the due regard provision we think is essentially precatory, as the -- as the Seventh Circuit said. It reminds the -- the Tax Court judge that he should not lightly set aside the credibility determinations. But again, that's not what happened here.
03-184 +++$+++ 5852 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So I -- I think your -- I think your answer then is not that this is invalid. It is simply unenforceable. It is precatory language, looks okay, but there's no way to police it.
03-184 +++$+++ 5853 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's certainly not enforceable in an appellate court. That's correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5854 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Judicially it cannot be enforced.
03-184 +++$+++ 5855 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, because otherwise it would violate the statute if it imposed some meaningful limitation. But again, it's important to understand here the Tax Court judge did not exercise his authority in this case to reverse or set aside the special trial judge's findings. He could have done so --
03-184 +++$+++ 5856 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do they -- do they ever? I mean, this -- this says, this decision -- it's labeled -- the -- the court agrees with and adopts the opinion of the special trial judge. Are there Tax Court cases where the Tax Court says, instead of that, the court modifies the decision of the special trial judge or the court rejects, in whole or in part, the report of the special trial judge?
03-184 +++$+++ 5857 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We cite --
03-184 +++$+++ 5858 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do Tax Court opinions come out that way?
03-184 +++$+++ 5859 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We cite in footnote 4 a small number of cases from prior to the last rule change in which that occurred. In addition, there are at least a couple of cases since the rule change in which the Tax Court judge rejected parts of the opinion, but not the findings. We're not aware of any cases in which the Tax Court judge has rejected the findings, but there are other cases -- Little against Commissioner, 103 T.C. 285; Walker against Commissioner, 101 T.C. 537 -- in which the Tax Court judge expressed a disagreement with a portion of the opinion of the special trial judge and then proceeded to decide the case in the manner he or she thought --
03-184 +++$+++ 5860 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because if one were just to rule this -- read this rule straight: first, the report that goes to the chief judge, and then it says that the Tax Court judge may modify it, reject it in whole -- adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part. You would expect, if we were having truth in labeling, that whenever, with consultation, without, there's a difference between the two documents, the Tax Court judge, in combination with the special trial judge or without, would say, action on the report -- action on the report, which is the special trial judge's report, is it is modified or it is rejected or it is rejected in part. I mean --
03-184 +++$+++ 5861 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, again, that assumes that the -- that the -- the rule compels the interpretation that the special trial judge is prohibited from withdrawing, correcting, and resubmitting his report. I submit it does not compel that interpretation, and the Tax Court --
03-184 +++$+++ 5862 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The rule -- the rule doesn't say anything about this consultation that you've described. And if that's the Tax Court's procedure, why isn't it laid out in the rules so everyone can see it instead of being deceived by reading here is the special trial judge's report, and now what the Tax Court will do is either adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part?
03-184 +++$+++ 5863 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think it -- I mean, I don't think it's -- it's deceitful, the -- the possibility that a court --
03-184 +++$+++ 5864 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Misleading. Because when I just read this rule cold, that's what I assumed, that we have the initial report and then it goes to the Tax Court judge, and that judge does something with it, and that something may be adopt, it may be modify, it may be reject in whole or in part.
03-184 +++$+++ 5865 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, when the Tax Court adopted its present procedures in 1984, it -- it certainly did not do so in as artful a manner as it could have. But the question is whether it violates the statute or due process for it to do what it has done. Let me just -- we've been spending most of our time talking about this issue of whether the Tax Court -- the special trial judge is permitted to change his report under rule 183. That's not even one of the questions in the questions presented. The only rule 183 question in the questions presented is whether the rule requires clear error review. We submit the answer to that is no because it would violate the Internal Revenue Code. So this -- this question about whether the report permits -- whether the rule permits the report to be changed isn't even one of the questions presented. The courts of appeals upheld the judgment on the premise that it was permissible for the Tax Court judge and the trial -- the special trial judge to engage in the deliberative process and for the special trial judge to revise his findings as he did --
03-184 +++$+++ 5866 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think there's any -- any question they can change the report, but the one -- the one -- I'd like to ask you a question as a matter of information. The first sentence of 183(c) refers to the possibility that the judge to whom the case is assigned may direct the filing of additional briefs to receive further evidence and oral argument. Does it ever happen that before the judge to whom it's assigned decides whether or not to go along with the recommended findings, that he will direct oral argument? Does that ever happen?
03-184 +++$+++ 5867 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor. I'm not aware of that, but --
03-184 +++$+++ 5868 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because if he did, it would seem almost necessary for him to disclose to the parties what the report they're arguing about would say.
03-184 +++$+++ 5869 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Again, I -- this is a holdover from the prior version of the rule in which the exceptions process was followed, and again, it may be that had the Tax Court given it further consideration, they might have viewed that unnecessary. But we're not aware of that happening.
03-184 +++$+++ 5870 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it certainly seems to contemplate deliberation by the judge to whom the case is assigned about whether or not to accept the report and deliberation which might be informed from input -- input from the parties. That's a fair reading of the rule, I think.
03-184 +++$+++ 5871 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If --
03-184 +++$+++ 5872 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Maybe it's not practiced.
03-184 +++$+++ 5873 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- if the Tax Court judge so determines, yes. The rule certainly allows that, but it doesn't obviously require that.
03-184 +++$+++ 5874 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if he did then ask for further briefings, do you think that there would then have been a requirement to disclose the report?
03-184 +++$+++ 5875 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, presumably it would be a waste of everyone's time unless he -- I don't know that he would have to disclose the report, but he would need to direct their attention to the issue he would like them to brief.
03-184 +++$+++ 5876 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me that the author of this subsection (c) must have contemplated the possibility of disclosure of the report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5877 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, again, Your Honor, this language was adopted at a time when they followed the exception --
03-184 +++$+++ 5878 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ When they followed a different procedure, and the question is to how much -- how much did they intend the -- to change that prior procedure.
03-184 +++$+++ 5879 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we know that the Tax Court has interpreted its rule to permit precisely the practice it followed here because it said so. And it would be quite extraordinary, we submit, for this Court to reverse the Tax Court, which is surely entitled to considerable deference in interpreting its own rules, since, after all, the Tax Court has exclusive statutory authority to promulgate its own rules, and particularly with respect to this issue about whether the special trial judge can change his report, since that was not even one of the questions presented. If I may turn to -- back to the statutory question. Section 7461 requires disclosure of reports of the Tax Court. The special trial judge report is not the report of the Tax Court. Indeed, even a Tax Court judge's opinion and report does not become the report of the Tax Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5880 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does the statute you just quoted prohibit the disclosure of other reports if we call this first draft something other than a report?
03-184 +++$+++ 5881 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The statute doesn't --
03-184 +++$+++ 5882 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, would -- would the rule go further than the statute?
03-184 +++$+++ 5883 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The statute does not prohibit the disclosure of other reports, but the rule clearly does not require the disclosure of reports. The Tax Court in 1984 amended the rule to make perfectly clear that -- that initial reports of special trial judges are not to be disclosed. The Tax Court said in its orders in this case the reason for that is that those are now internal deliberative processes. The Tax Court has made clear that its rules permit exactly what it's doing here.
03-184 +++$+++ 5884 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Hungar, you started to say that -- that even the opinion of a -- of a Tax Court judge is not a report of the Tax Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5885 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-184 +++$+++ 5886 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How does that work?
03-184 +++$+++ 5887 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Page 2a of the appendix to the gray brief, at the bottom of the page, section 7460(b) provides that the report of the division -- and the Tax Court is now and has for many years been divided into one-judge divisions. They used to sit en banc or --
03-184 +++$+++ 5888 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I was -- I was going to ask you what -- what 7461 referred to when it says the Tax Court and its divisions.
03-184 +++$+++ 5889 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5890 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It also is referred to there.
03-184 +++$+++ 5891 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ For a brief period of time, they sat in -- in panels.
03-184 +++$+++ 5892 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I see.
03-184 +++$+++ 5893 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But they -- the -- the press of work force them to -- to divide into one-judge divisions.
03-184 +++$+++ 5894 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it's a single judge is a division of the Tax Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5895 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, that's correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5896 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the publicity of proceedings does say -- it does say that all reports of the Tax Court --
03-184 +++$+++ 5897 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-184 +++$+++ 5898 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And all evidence received by the Tax Court and its divisions, meaning its single judges. Well, what happens with -- with a single judge's opinion?
03-184 +++$+++ 5899 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He -- he prepares it and submits it to the chief judge under rule -- under statute -- under the statute 7460(b) where it says the report of the division shall become the report of the Tax Court within 30 days after such report by the division, unless the chief judge directs it to be reviewed by the full court. So -- so even a Tax Court judge's opinion is not the report of the Tax Court. Surely the report of the special trial judge is not either.
03-184 +++$+++ 5900 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's like an en banc. I -- I have written decisions for a panel in my years on the court of appeals, and there's been an en banc and my opinion gets vacated. It's no longer counts for anything. And isn't that exactly what the Tax Court is? They have the --
03-184 +++$+++ 5901 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. The -- the opinion is not made public. In fact, the statute precludes it from being made -- made a part of the record. The last sentence of that same section 7460(b) at the top of page 3a, it says the report of a division shall not be a part of the record in any case in which the chief judge directs that such report shall be reviewed by the Tax Court. And that's a very important point. Congress has mandated by statute essentially the same procedure that the Tax Court follows here.
03-184 +++$+++ 5902 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, no. No, no, no. How often, when there is a decision reviewed by the court, so that the initial judge's decision is changed, does that judge dissent, so all the world knows what that judge's initial position was?
03-184 +++$+++ 5903 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the Tax Court judge certainly has the authority to dissent, just as a special trial judge has the authority and, indeed, the obligation under the code of conduct to refuse to put his name on a -- on a report if he doesn't agree with it. If he doesn't agree with the Tax Court judge's view, he has the obligation, the ethical obligation -- and we presume he follows it -- to say I don't agree. This is my report. If you --
03-184 +++$+++ 5904 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then he -- then he can publish his -- he can publish his dissent, just as a Tax Court judge can?
03-184 +++$+++ 5905 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but he can preclude the Tax Court judge from doing what the Tax Court judge did in this case, which is simply adopting his report. If the -- if the special trial judge refuses to change his report --
03-184 +++$+++ 5906 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But then we still won't know what his report is. Yes, he can say, I won't sign this. Tax Court says, fine. This rule says I can reject your findings in whole or in part. I don't need your name on this decision of the Tax Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5907 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, if -- if that were the case here, obviously our arguments would be more difficult. But that is not what happened here. If -- if --
03-184 +++$+++ 5908 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm asking you just as the -- the judge who disagrees with the -- the full court can publish his dissent, can the special trial judge who disagrees with the Tax Court judge publish his dissent?
03-184 +++$+++ 5909 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In the -- the one case involving a change in the opinion, where the Tax Court judge said, I don't adopt a portion of the opinion of the special trial judge, there was no published opinion of the special trial judge. So I don't believe there's a procedure for the dissent. But the point is the court of appeals --
03-184 +++$+++ 5910 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Has there ever been? Has there ever been?
03-184 +++$+++ 5911 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ A published dissent by a special trial judge? Not that I'm aware of. But the point is the court of --
03-184 +++$+++ 5912 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And how -- how often does the -- is there a dissent when there's -- when there's a full court review decision?
03-184 +++$+++ 5913 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there's often a dissent. It's -- it's hard to know from the standpoint of a researcher when -- when it is that the judge who heard the evidence and tried the case is the one who's dissenting, unless they happen to say it in their opinion, because again, there's no original opinion issued by the Tax Court judge who first heard the case. That's kept confidential by statute, which again is an important point. Congress has mandated confidentiality of the initial reports prepared even by Tax Court judges, and it has given the Tax Court plenary authority to promulgate rules governing special trial judges. It is hardly surprising, let alone impermissible under the statute or Due Process Clause, for the Tax Court to follow a similar process for special trial judges.
03-184 +++$+++ 5914 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Except that the -- the relationship between the -- the one judge and the full Tax Court is a relationship basically of people who are in the same boat with respect to what they know about or can know about law and what they can know about the evidence and the facts of the case; whereas the relationship between the special trial judge and the judge to whom it is assigned is -- is quite different because only one of them has heard evidence and only one of them is the source of conclusion about fact.
03-184 +++$+++ 5915 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. It's identical. The -- the full Tax Court --
03-184 +++$+++ 5916 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It certainly is not identical in -- in the sense that the -- the Tax Court judge then goes and listens to evidence. He doesn't. That's the whole point.
03-184 +++$+++ 5917 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, neither does the full Tax Court when it --
03-184 +++$+++ 5918 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Neither does the full Tax Court, but if the full Tax Court is disagreeing with one judge, the one judge and the full Tax Court are in the same boat. They have access to the same material. Their limits are exactly the same in each case. That is not true in the relationship between the single Tax Court judge and the special Tax Court judge. The special Tax Court judge is the only one who has heard evidence and can find facts based upon the evidence that he heard.
03-184 +++$+++ 5919 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. The -- the tax -- the full Tax Court doesn't go back and -- and hold a new trial, just like the individual Tax Court judges --
03-184 +++$+++ 5920 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I am quite aware of that. That's not -- that's not the point. I'm -- I'm saying that you cannot draw an analogy between one judge and full Tax Court and use that as an analogy to legitimize the relationship between one judge and a trial master. They are in different positions. They are not in parallel positions.
03-184 +++$+++ 5921 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, then if -- if I understand the point you're making, it's a point of the -- the -- it's the hierarchy issue, if that's -- if that's the point you're making.
03-184 +++$+++ 5922 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's the knowledge issue. The special Tax Court judge heard somebody.
03-184 +++$+++ 5923 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So did the Tax Court judge --
03-184 +++$+++ 5924 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Nobody on the Tax Court did.
03-184 +++$+++ 5925 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. That's incorrect.
03-184 +++$+++ 5926 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, they're -- they're sitting hearing witnesses? They are -- they are redoing the trial? Surely not.
03-184 +++$+++ 5927 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, in a review -- if a Tax Court judge -- most Tax Court cases are tried by Tax Court judges. Tax Court judges are trial judges, and if a Tax Court judge tries a case --
03-184 +++$+++ 5928 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But we are talking about situations in which the trial judge is the special judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5929 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm talking about the full Tax Court, Your Honor. If the full Tax Court reviews an individual Tax Court judge's decision, the Tax Court judge has presided over the trial, heard the evidence, just like the special trial judge here, and then the full Tax Court judge reviews it. That's exactly what happened in the Estate of Varian case, which is in our briefs, out of the Ninth Circuit. The parties complained that they wanted access to the original judge's report because he had been reversed -- been reversed by the full court after trial on an -- on an evidentiary issue, and the Ninth Circuit said no.
03-184 +++$+++ 5930 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Hungar, I think we understand your answer.
03-184 +++$+++ 5931 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you.
03-184 +++$+++ 5932 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Shapiro, you have about 4 minutes left.
03-184 +++$+++ 5934 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The question came up whether rule 183 forbids disclosure of this report. The answer is it does not forbid disclosure of the report. It is silent on the point. But the press release the Tax Court issued in 1983, coming from the chief judge of the court, said that this simply meant that it would not automatically be disclosed.
03-184 +++$+++ 5935 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why does 7461 require its -- its disclosure? Because it does say that the -- it's only the decision of the Tax Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5936 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-184 +++$+++ 5937 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That reports of the Tax Court that have to be disclosed.
03-184 +++$+++ 5938 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our view is that of -- of the Tax Court means any report emanating from the Tax Court. That's the literal meaning of that language. It doesn't mean final.
03-184 +++$+++ 5939 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that -- that would mean that -- that you would have to make public the -- the reports of a regular Tax Court judge in cases that then go on to the full court. And that's not done, is it?
03-184 +++$+++ 5940 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's an exception for the en banc situation because legal issues are addressed en banc, not the factual issues. And there's an opportunity to dissent.
03-184 +++$+++ 5941 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but it doesn't matter. It would still be a report of the Tax Court if you don't take that language literally. If you say any report coming out of the institution is a report of the Tax Court, you would have to make public the reports of the individual Tax Court judges, which is not done.
03-184 +++$+++ 5942 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, we say there's a special statute dealing with the en banc situation that -- that governs in that situation. And that the publicity --
03-184 +++$+++ 5943 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why is that? What -- what statute is that?
03-184 +++$+++ 5944 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that's the en banc provision that counsel referred to that said that when the case is heard en banc, the trial -- the -- the single judge's report is not made part of the record. Congress' assumption there was that there would be a new -- new report issued. People would be able to dissent if they disagreed. And this process focuses on legal issues. There is no presumption of correctness.
03-184 +++$+++ 5945 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's not a -- that's not a de novo -- they can rehear matters de novo on the en banc Tax Court, can they not? That's a de novo hearing.
03-184 +++$+++ 5946 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but it addresses legal issues. It's not a device to second guess factual determinations, and there's a special statute that deals with that, which does not apply to this STJ situation, where there's a presumption of correctness applicable to what the trial judge does. And there is the general disclosure statute that applies there.
03-184 +++$+++ 5947 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know if I'm getting -- so that's his basic point. The rule doesn't require the disclosure because they've interpreted it differently within their -- within their discretion. Statute doesn't require it and the Constitution doesn't require it. We have to go to the Constitution, I don't see exactly the implications. So I'm nervous. And now, the reports -- he says, go read 7460(b). That's what they're talking about. And then -- and again, I don't know what I'm getting into once I read it more broadly than that. And what about all evidence received by the Tax Court, including a transcript. Of course, this isn't evidence but neither is a transcript. And -- and so maybe that word evidence can be read more broadly, given the fact that it's to include a transcript of the stenographic report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5948 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think you're right, and --
03-184 +++$+++ 5949 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You think I'm right just suddenly for the for the first time? You have thought of this?
03-184 +++$+++ 5950 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I think that the intent of this provision -- and I know Your Honor consults the legislative history. The intent was to make all of the steps in the adjudicative process transparent, including the evidence, including the -- the stenographer's report, and all reports from the Tax Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5951 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's -- there's a very careful use of language. It says all reports of the Tax Court and all evidence received by the Tax Court and its divisions. So it's only the evidence that -- that's received by the individual judges has to be made public, not the reports.
03-184 +++$+++ 5952 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we believe that the word all is a broad, generic inclusive term that should be applied, as Judge Cudahy stated, to an STJ report that actually has to be submitted to the chief judge and that has legal effect. It's not just a casual document like a law clerk memorandum. It has legally operative effect. Congress' purpose here was very broad, to have transparency, applicable to all the steps along the way in the Tax Court. It was quite clear on that, that there are arbitrary actions at each step of the way. If you look at the Senate report and Congressman LaGuardia's statements, they said secrecy is a vicious practice in this context, and it -- it should be avoided.
03-184 +++$+++ 5953 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But we -- we don't have to get into any of that if we accept your argument about 7482(a)(1), that is, the record will be in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5954 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor. There -- there are three separate bases for ruling in our favor. One is the appellate review statute. The other is the disclosure statute. The third is due process. And due process should inform the construction of these statutes. This Court tries to avoid serious due process issues through its interpretation of legislation. Judge Cudahy suggested that was the right way to decide this case and we agree that it is. We thank the Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5955 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Shapiro. The case is submitted.
03-287 +++$+++ 5959 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll now hear argument in Wilkinson against Dotson. Solicitor Cole.
03-287 +++$+++ 5961 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Prisoners typically want two things: first, to improve their conditions while in prison; and second, to get out of prison as quickly as possible. Respondents' claims here are not conditions claims. They do not seek a larger cell or better food while in prison. Rather, their claims are about getting out of prison. Traditional understandings of habeas would suggest that these release-driven claims lie there, not in section 1983, and this Court's decision in Heck confirms that this common sense answer is also the correct answer. In fact, Heck establishes two bars, each of which independently prevent respondents from using section 1983 to pursue their claims here. First, Heck establishes that civil actions under section 1983 cannot be used to collaterally attack State criminal judgments. Before a prisoner can advance a claim under section 1983 that would necessarily imply the invalidity of such a judgment, he must first show that it has been favorably terminated. And Edwards v. Balisok confirms that quasi-judicial administrative decisions regarding the duration of confinement count as criminal judgments for this purpose.
03-287 +++$+++ 5962 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it isn't just duration of -- of confinement. I mean, in -- in Balisok, what you had was a determination that the confinement would be definitely less as a result of the -- the good time scheme. The -- the gut notion behind Balisok was that what you were attacking would imply that the sentence itself was invalid because the conviction was and so on. We don't have that here. What we have here is a scheme that makes a -- a sentence that is imposed a more definite sentence. We know where in the range it's going to be reconsidered. And however that may be classified, it's not simply a Balisok situation.
03-287 +++$+++ 5963 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's arguably different than the good-time credits at issue in Balisok, as -- as Your Honor notes. However, I -- I would suggest that even with respect to good-time credits, often under many State systems, good-time credits have the dual effect of moving up the parole eligibility date, as well as potentially -- and in some States, it doesn't even have an effect on the --
03-287 +++$+++ 5964 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, but that had --
03-287 +++$+++ 5965 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- of the sentence.
03-287 +++$+++ 5966 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that had nothing to do with the rationale in Balisok, as I recall it. Isn't that correct?
03-287 +++$+++ 5967 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, the -- the Court -- that's -- that's correct, yes. And I guess what I'd -- I'd say is that what seemed to be driving the Court, though, was still the durational aspect of the sentence; that is, as the Court said in Muhammad, if a claim threatens no consequence for the duration of confinement, then that isn't a -- or that isn't a claim that should be brought in 1983.
03-287 +++$+++ 5968 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No -- no question. But the durational consequence in those cases was a definite consequence of longer duration, i.e., a sentence in the first place, a sentence not reduced by good time in -- in the second example. Here, there -- there is no such clear consequence. Here, the consequence is that there will simply be a period of time before a sentence already imposed will be reviewed to determine whether, in fact, it will be shortened or allowed to run. And that's different.
03-287 +++$+++ 5969 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not sure it is, Your Honor. Both of them are going to have definite durational consequences for confinement.
03-287 +++$+++ 5970 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No -- no question about that. At -- at the level of whether there is a durational consequence, they -- they both have it. I -- I grant you that.
03-287 +++$+++ 5971 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And, Your Honor, as far back as Preiser, this Court has noted that challenges to duration go to the very heart of habeas corpus. That's --
03-287 +++$+++ 5972 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The duration of -- of the sentence. And here, there's no implication at all that this sentence is in any way invalid, that the sentence itself or any portion of it is invalid because the parole would be a matter of administrative grace, but it doesn't -- the determination of parole eligibility or parole suitability does not go to the validity of the sentence in any way, shape, or manner. Does it?
03-287 +++$+++ 5973 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, a decision from a Federal court -- and I guess -- I think the answer to Your -- Your Honor's question is yes, it does. And the reason I say that is I think we need to look to the consequences of the Federal court decision that would follow from the claims that -- that the plaintiffs -- or I'm sorry -- the prisoners here are advancing. The State of Ohio has made individualized decisions with respect to each of these respondents that they should not again be considered for release from prison until 2005. The request -- the relief that they're requesting and the claims that they're bringing, if successful, would result in the Federal court undermining that State decision with regard to the length that they should be incarcerated. It goes directly to the -- the --
03-287 +++$+++ 5974 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't -- it doesn't shorten the length that they're going to be incarcerated. There -- there is no certainty that -- that if they win this action, they will be incarcerated for a lesser period, is there?
03-287 +++$+++ 5975 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely no certainty of that, Your Honor. But there is certainty --
03-287 +++$+++ 5976 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and there was in the other cases, wasn't there? In Balisok.
03-287 +++$+++ 5977 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I don't think so. I mean, prisoners could be released in the State of Washington before the terminus of their sentence. They might not -- it isn't as though they had to serve all the way till the end, less whatever good-time credits they had. They could easily be --
03-287 +++$+++ 5978 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but --
03-287 +++$+++ 5979 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- released prior to that time.
03-287 +++$+++ 5980 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, indeed, but the -- but -- but getting the good-time credits entitled them to be -- be released earlier. They might have been released even earlier still, but their entitlement to be released earlier was a consequence, wasn't it?
03-287 +++$+++ 5981 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was, Your Honor.
03-287 +++$+++ 5982 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And there is no entitlement to be released earlier as a consequence of this.
03-287 +++$+++ 5983 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We --
03-287 +++$+++ 5984 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You just get another hearing and maybe you will, maybe you won't.
03-287 +++$+++ 5985 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. You'll -- you'll just get another hearing. But an important note on that: you'll get another hearing, and you'll get another hearing sooner than the State has decided that you should get a hearing.
03-287 +++$+++ 5986 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's true. So it makes it possible that you'll get released earlier, but -- but there's no assurance you'll -- really, the crucial question for me, I think, is whether -- whether this could have been brought as a habeas action. Could this have been brought as a habeas action?
03-287 +++$+++ 5987 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, it could have been brought as a habeas action. If you look at the nature of their complaints, they're -- they're clearly in custody. Habeas would require custody and violation of the Constitution of the United States.
03-287 +++$+++ 5988 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But they're just asking for a new hearing. They're not asking for an earlier release. What's your closest case that -- that would allow a habeas action which does not seek an earlier release but just -- just a hearing?
03-287 +++$+++ 5989 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think probably the Garlotte case, Your Honor, in which the Court allowed a habeas challenge where the only result was going to be to advance the date of eligibility for release from prison incarceration.
03-287 +++$+++ 5990 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. But it -- No, go on.
03-287 +++$+++ 5991 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it -- it doesn't advance the date of eligibility. It advances the date at which the parole board will take another look. The only eligibility is an eligibility to take -- to have another look taken and not an eligibility for release.
03-287 +++$+++ 5992 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true, Your Honor, but these -- under that understanding of eligibility, where eligibility means the first possible release date. But these prisoners are not eligible for release in the sense of it's not going to happen for them unless and until the next release hearing.
03-287 +++$+++ 5993 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if they are subject to another look, they are not necessarily then eligible for release. And I think that's the point that we're getting -- let me -- let me ask a -- a sort of complementary question. Is there any reason that these --
03-287 +++$+++ 5994 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is this with an I or an E?
03-287 +++$+++ 5995 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I was hoping for an I, yes.
03-287 +++$+++ 5996 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With an I or an E?
03-287 +++$+++ 5997 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With an E. With an E. But if -- if you take my questioning as a compliment with an I, that's perfectly okay too. (Laughter.)
03-287 +++$+++ 5998 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'll -- I'll wait and see what the question is --
03-287 +++$+++ 5999 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let's see what it is. The -- the question is, could these claims not have been brought in advance of any application to these particular prisoners of the revised -- whatever they were -- the 1998 guidelines? And if the answer is yes, then they could be brought at a time when, I suppose, habeas would -- would not have been a possible remedy. Is -- is -- am I correct on those two points?
03-287 +++$+++ 6000 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The State concedes that if they had brought this case before a parole hearing at which the guidelines were applied, that it would be a different case, and that 1983 would be a remedy in that -- in that situation.
03-287 +++$+++ 6001 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Here's -- here's the difficulty that I -- that I have. When I read your brief, I thought, well, he must be right because this is really about custody. It's really about custody. They want to get out eventually. But then when I -- I -- when I went back to Balisok, I thought, oh, here's the problem. The problem is that it's a damage remedy in Balisok. And normally you want the person to go into 1983 to get damages. But he's going to get mixed up. When do you send him to habeas? Well, we don't want to send him to habeas unless it's clear that habeas should have been brought. And so if he's just challenging, for example, introduction of Fourth Amendment violation evidence or something like that, don't got to habeas. Don't go to habeas. You didn't have to go to habeas unless you had to, unless you had -- unless it was necessary to upset the conviction. You see? That's why that language is there. Now, I got that far. Then I said, oh, I see what you do. We should have one rule for damages. Well, that makes sense. But there's no reason not to have a different rule when you have the injunctive action, and there maybe we could follow your rule. But the next thing I come across is a statement that says, no, no, the rule is the same whether you bring a damage action or whether you bring an injunctive or declaratory relief action. And I said, well, why did we write that? You know, we're the ones who caused all this trouble. But the -- the -- well, because we didn't want to make it too complicated and -- and not have all the questions coming, well, what kind of an action is it really, et cetera. Okay. So once I got that far, I said, oh, well, I'm going to have to change something for you to win. Either I have to change the thing that says the damages should be the same as the injunctive, or I have to change something else somewhere along the line, the word necessary. I don't want to change the word necessary. Maybe I could change the other, but why bother really? Because all that's important here is people know which way they should go. Now, that's where I am at the moment, thinking give him his 1983 action. It's simpler. It follows from Balisok. Why not?
03-287 +++$+++ 6002 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, there would be some real consequences that would follow from that.
03-287 +++$+++ 6003 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's what I thought.
03-287 +++$+++ 6004 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The reason that it's important that these cases go to habeas rather than 1983 is because of the State court exhaustion requirement that's attendant with habeas. Parole claims like those advanced here are often, if not always, intricately bound up with State law issues, and the State law is often going to provide much more meaningful relief than the Federal law claims that the prisoners advance.
03-287 +++$+++ 6005 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Doesn't the Prison Litigation Reform Act require exhaustion even in a 1983 action?
03-287 +++$+++ 6006 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but as Your Honor is aware, that's an administrative exhaustion requirement which this Court referred to in Nelson, I believe, as a substantially lower gate than the exhaustion requirement imposed by habeas. Moreover, it's telling --
03-287 +++$+++ 6007 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is -- may -- may I just follow up on that question? At the administrative level, cannot these State law policies perfectly well be taken into consideration? In other words, your argument was these things are bound up with State law issues and the best place to have them resolved is -- is in a State forum. They can be resolved in a State administrative forum, can't they?
03-287 +++$+++ 6008 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They could, Your Honor, but I -- I think the types of legal determinations with respect to legal entitlements and also the court -- we would assume a State court would also consider Federal claims that might be made by the prisoners when they bring their State court claim. Those types of legal claims are better resolved by State courts. They have the expertise to make the -- the determination. And in fact, in Ohio --
03-287 +++$+++ 6009 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, couldn't one say the same thing of prison conditions that you can bring in as a 1983 action? The States know better about how their prisons are operating and what changes would have to be made. So I -- I think that you -- you may be right that the State knows more about how its parole system operates, but so does it know more about how its prison system operates. And that doesn't -- that's not what determines whether you have 1983 or habeas.
03-287 +++$+++ 6010 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but Congress, with respect to conditions claims -- and if you look at the language of the administrative exhaustion requirement in the PLRA at 42 U.S.C. 1997(e)(a), it says no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under 1983 without administrative exhaustion. So even Congress, in thinking about the PLRA and in thinking about requiring administrative exhaustion, understood that 1983 is really about conditions of confinement. 1983 isn't about -- it never has been about -- release. Habeas has traditionally been the relief that people -- or the cause of action that people bring when what they're interested in is relief -- or release from prison. And these claims, no one can dispute, are release-driven claims. They may not ultimately be successful in securing release, but the prisoners here --
03-287 +++$+++ 6011 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, no, I've got that part. But the -- and -- and you're right about that part. But that -- you know, that doesn't get over the -- the hump here I think because of the -- what we've written. The -- I mean, where I'm coming out now, what you've just said, is well, you know, there's going to be exhaustion in both cases. And prison conditions, if we say that habeas doesn't -- that 1983 applies here I think probably -- I can't guarantee it -- but those where prison conditions would then cover it, and then there would be exhaustion, and there -- where it doesn't seem to make difference there. And now I'm back to asking the other half of this, which is, well, all right, suppose I say I see your point, I think you're right. Now, what -- what is your recommendation? What do we change? Do we change the word necessary in Balisok, which I'd be pretty reluctant to do? Or do we drive a wedge between the damage cases and the injunctive/declaratory relief cases?
03-287 +++$+++ 6012 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think you need to do either, Your Honor. I think if we go back to Heck and look at the language there that talks about necessarily implying the invalidity of a criminal judgment, which is something --
03-287 +++$+++ 6013 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, well.
03-287 +++$+++ 6014 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- respondents concede in their brief, the only question then is does a parole decision count as a, quote, criminal --
03-287 +++$+++ 6015 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. No, but then what you're doing is taking the first half because what you're reading is you're reading that word necessary, whatever those words were in Balisok that we were just talking about, as your case satisfying that condition. And if your case satisfies that condition, then so does the case where a person wants to bring a damage action because of illegally seized evidence at his trial. Doesn't it? I mean, because all -- I mean -- and then we've swept -- then we've done -- we've really moved Balisok from what it was trying to do.
03-287 +++$+++ 6016 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think that's necessarily right, Your Honor, because the illegally seized evidence at the trial -- I don't know that that would necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction that resulted from that trial.
03-287 +++$+++ 6017 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why is he bringing his damage action? He thinks he's bringing it because what they did at that trial hurt me. Now, how did it hurt me? It hurt me because I went right to prison.
03-287 +++$+++ 6018 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, Your Honor, and that -- that's absolutely correct, but I'm not arguing for, and I want to make it very clear that I'm not arguing for any rule that would turn on the subjective intent of the prisoner in bringing their claim. It turns on the necessary implication of success on that claim, and that's a -- a distinction that the Court made both in Heck and in Balisok. They looked to what's the necessary implication. So we look to the claims here, not why they brought them, but what are the claims. And the claims here, and the particular ones that I would focus on, are the ex post facto claims. If the -- if they have success on their ex post facto claims -- and we don't believe their claims are meritorious, but if they're successful on those claims, there's no way the State's decision can stand. They are entitled to a new hearing at which they would again be considered for parole --
03-287 +++$+++ 6019 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but does that mean the -- the judgment -- the order denying release on parole is invalid? There are really two parts to it. One, you -- we're not going to release you. Secondly, your next hearing will be at a later date than you want. Insofar as you challenge the date of the hearing -- the date of the next hearing, does that necessarily imply the invalidity of the entire order denying parole?
03-287 +++$+++ 6020 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- we concede that if there's an ex post facto violation here, these prisoners are entitled to a new parole hearing. And I guess the --
03-287 +++$+++ 6021 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But they're not entitled to parole.
03-287 +++$+++ 6022 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor. Absolutely.
03-287 +++$+++ 6023 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that it doesn't totally invalidate the order that is at issue.
03-287 +++$+++ 6024 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the way that -- that I've been thinking about it is if you put the State parole decision up on the wall and you put the Federal decision up on the wall, one of them has to come down. The Federal decision trumps the State decision. It can --
03-287 +++$+++ 6025 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it doesn't entirely come down. It just -- half of it comes down.
03-287 +++$+++ 6026 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. The whole thing comes down, Your Honor. They're entitled both to an immediate new release hearing and --
03-287 +++$+++ 6027 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But not for release.
03-287 +++$+++ 6028 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- if they're successful on their claims, they're entitled to more frequent release hearings in the future. So the decision, the State's --
03-287 +++$+++ 6029 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but isn't it true that one aspect of your order that's under attack is they had refused to grant them parole?
03-287 +++$+++ 6030 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-287 +++$+++ 6031 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that remains.
03-287 +++$+++ 6032 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't, Your Honor. They have to decide that again. That -- that order is void ab initio. It's as though it were never entered. They have to make a new decision about whether or not this person should -- should have parole and that they cannot in any way -- the State cannot rely on the prior decision that they reached on that issue.
03-287 +++$+++ 6033 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought the only relief they were seeking was a more prompt next hearing.
03-287 +++$+++ 6034 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, they -- Dotson's complaint, I believe at page 20 of the joint appendix -- he wants to, quote, proceed toward a prompt and immediate parole hearing in accordance with the statutory laws and administrative rules in place when the plaintiff committed his crimes. They want an --
03-287 +++$+++ 6035 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But aren't -- aren't those claims moot or academic now? Because, as I understand it, he has had another parole hearing. So he's -- with the hearing that he was seeking, he's already had another. So he's not complaining about the absence of a hearing or -- or flaws in the procedure at the hearing. I thought that this case now reduces to a clean question about the retroactive application of the new guidelines.
03-287 +++$+++ 6036 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it isn't a clean question, Your Honor, because exactly the same error that he alleges infected his first hearing was present at his second hearing. If -- if you look at the materials that they added to their brief at lines 3, 7, and 8 where they have the new parole decision, it's clear that Dotson's 2002 parole decision was predicated on exactly the same guidelines, exactly the same 1998 guidelines that he says violated his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause. So, in fact, if anything, it's made his situation worse because a Federal decision on his claims now would both necessarily imply the invalidity of his previous hearing and the 2002 hearing, and the 2002 hearing was a release hearing. Unlike the halfway review that occurred earlier, it was a full-fledged release hearing in 2002, at which the parole board decided both that he should not get parole then and that he should not again be considered for parole until 2005.
03-287 +++$+++ 6037 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was there -- maybe I'm wrong about this, but I thought there no challenge being made to the 2002 hearing.
03-287 +++$+++ 6038 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what Heck makes clear is it doesn't matter what you say you're challenging. What we need to look to is what's the necessary implication of securing success on your claims in Federal court for a State decision. Here, the necessary implication, if they're successful on their ex post facto claims, is going to be that the 2002 decision can't stand, the 1999 decision --
03-287 +++$+++ 6039 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why can't it simply be that prospectively for this class of prisoner, the old guidelines will apply, prospectively without undoing anything that's happened in the past?
03-287 +++$+++ 6040 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think for the same reason that in Balisok I don't think there could have been a prospective order that said -- said something like the method you have for choosing decision-makers creates fraud, bias, and deceit, on a going-forward basis you must change that method for selecting decision-makers. Saying that you have to change it on a going-forward basis would mean, necessarily imply, that there had been fraud, bias, and deceit by the decision-maker that would mean that --
03-287 +++$+++ 6041 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think twice you started something and our questions impeded you. But I think you were equating the parole board's decision to a criminal sentence, and so you -- you were saying just as the -- the Federal authority can't come in and nullify the State criminal sentence, neither can it nullify the parole board determination. And -- and I thought that the comparison between a -- a sentence -- a criminal conviction and sentence and a parole board's discretionary determination -- you seemed to be putting those on the same plane.
03-287 +++$+++ 6042 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not exactly on the same plane, Your Honor, but recognizing that this Court in Balisok said that post-judgment administrative decisions regarding the duration of confinement also count as criminal judgments that are protected for purposes of -- of the Heck doctrine. And in Greenholtz, this Court --
03-287 +++$+++ 6043 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but the -- the generality at which you keep referring to it, with respect to conditions of confinement, is a -- is a higher level of generality than anything that Balisok decided. In Balisok, the particular decision was a decision to revoke an entitlement to be released at whatever the date the good time would give, and -- and that is a much more specific -- I mean, that literally affects an entitlement to be released. It is not merely a decision with respect to length of confinement.
03-287 +++$+++ 6044 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, if this turns on whether or not it's an entitlement, I would agree with you that it seems good-time credits might be different from an entitlement sense than parole. But -- but all the way back, in tracing the cases from Preiser forward, the Court has talked about duration of confinement, and certainly no one can argue that the decision here is going to have dramatic consequences for the duration of these prisoners' confinement.
03-287 +++$+++ 6045 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- we don't know what consequence it will have for the duration of his confinement. All we know is that it will have a consequence in determining the date at which the next look will be taken by the parole board to see whether he then is in a condition to be released. That's all we can tell.
03-287 +++$+++ 6046 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor, but they're -- they're pressing ex post facto claims. And as this point -- Court pointed out in Garner in 2000, they can maybe bring those claims based on changes in frequency of parole hearings, but they're going to have to show a definite impact on the quantum of punishment that they receive as a result of that change. So if they're going to be successful on their ex post facto claims, they're going to have to show an impact on the duration of their confinement. Either they have no ex post facto claim because there's no durational impact on their --
03-287 +++$+++ 6047 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. But you're -- you're assuming -- your argument now is assuming that they are going to be successful on this element, that you say they've got to satisfy later.
03-287 +++$+++ 6048 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, but that's the Heck --
03-287 +++$+++ 6049 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and whether they are or not has nothing to do with -- with Balisok and Heck.
03-287 +++$+++ 6050 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I disagree, Your Honor, because in Heck and Balisok, the Court said look to what happens if they're successful on their claims. So I'm -- we're -- the State is supposed to hypothesize that somehow they're going to be successful on these claims. We don't agree it's going to happen, but once we hypothesize that they're going to be successful on an ex post facto claim, it means they're going to have to show, have to demonstrate a durational impact on their sentence.
03-287 +++$+++ 6051 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. It also -- it also means that if -- if -- assuming your argument is sound, if you lose this case, you win the war. (Laughter.)
03-287 +++$+++ 6052 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At -- at some level, I think there's an -- an inherent and fundamental tension in their position, and -- and the coin could flipped and conversely there's that same tension in ours.
03-287 +++$+++ 6053 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are -- are you sure that that's what they have to prove, that -- a durational impact? Wouldn't it be enough to show that they were deprived of an opportunity to have the sentence shorter? Wouldn't -- wouldn't it -- assuming there was an ex post facto violation, wouldn't that be enough of an injury, that they lost an opportunity to have their sentence shortened?
03-287 +++$+++ 6054 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, I believe what makes out the ex post facto claim is an increase in the quantum of punishment after they've committed their crimes. So they need to show that as an element. I -- I see -- I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, if I could.
03-287 +++$+++ 6055 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You may do so. Mr. Lewis.
03-287 +++$+++ 6057 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case presents a straightforward opportunity to apply the Heck rule. Respondent Johnson's section --
03-287 +++$+++ 6058 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can you tell us why -- why is it still live when they -- when they already received a second hearing? Or why is not moot?
03-287 +++$+++ 6059 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Johnson still has remaining claims for prospective injunctive relief in this case and, as well, declaratory relief. What may be mooted is his claim for retroactive injunctive relief, in other words, a new parole hearing. I think in order for him to pursue that type of a claim, he'd have to go back down to the district court.
03-287 +++$+++ 6060 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What -- what is --
03-287 +++$+++ 6061 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, put in plain language what it is Johnson is claiming he's entitled to. I don't understand.
03-287 +++$+++ 6062 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, he -- really three different things. He's requesting prospective injunctive relief, fix the due process violations that are going on in Ohio parole proceedings.
03-287 +++$+++ 6063 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which is a new -- a new parole hearing. Isn't -- I mean, it -- I --
03-287 +++$+++ 6064 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How could that be fixed?
03-287 +++$+++ 6065 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. How -- how can it be fixed except by giving him a new parole hearing?
03-287 +++$+++ 6066 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, he does have a class action. He filed a class action and he's trying to fix the proceeding prospectively. It doesn't necessarily require him to have a new parole hearing. He's still in confinement and will very likely have a new parole hearing, a new parole hearing that he wants the proceedings to be different in. He's not necessarily asking for a new parole hearing. He's saying --
03-287 +++$+++ 6067 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why isn't he? If -- if -- what he's saying is the past proceedings were invalid, I want you to do it right in the future.
03-287 +++$+++ 6068 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. I think that was part of his claim, which might be mooted, but he's also saying in any future --
03-287 +++$+++ 6069 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. It -- it isn't mooted because he still got it done wrong. The second hearing was still wrong.
03-287 +++$+++ 6070 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we don't --
03-287 +++$+++ 6071 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ His claims here -- if his claims here are correct.
03-287 +++$+++ 6072 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We don't know that for sure, but part of his claim as well is to say in future parole hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, even if you don't give me a new one, in future parole hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, I want these processes fixed to -- to come into compliance with due process. And I think that's separate and apart from --
03-287 +++$+++ 6073 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- you say we don't know whether the -- the new parole hearing he got was still invalid?
03-287 +++$+++ 6074 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think there's enough in the record to determine that.
03-287 +++$+++ 6075 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, so we can assume that that was valid. You're -- you're willing to assume that for purposes of this case?
03-287 +++$+++ 6076 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I am not willing to assume that. I -- I don't think we can say one way or the other.
03-287 +++$+++ 6077 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well,
03-287 +++$+++ 6078 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We can't yet.
03-287 +++$+++ 6079 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay, fine.
03-287 +++$+++ 6080 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We may intend to.
03-287 +++$+++ 6081 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then we take it as valid. Then we take it as valid. That's not a claim you're challenging. But I take it your claim is in the year 2009 he will have another hearing.
03-287 +++$+++ 6082 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Actually 2005.
03-287 +++$+++ 6083 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ 2005? Okay, 2005 he'll have another hearing.
03-287 +++$+++ 6084 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-287 +++$+++ 6085 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And in the year 2005, I want not to have the -- what are they called? The 1998 guidelines. I don't want my 1998 guidelines applied in the 2005 hearing because you have some theory, maybe good, maybe bad, but it's a theory that that would violate the Constitution of the United States.
03-287 +++$+++ 6086 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-287 +++$+++ 6087 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you're saying he's going to have this. I want an injunction or declaratory relief they can't do it.
03-287 +++$+++ 6088 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right, and as well, he says I want to be heard at this next parole hearing. Now, that was -- part of his due process allegations in this case were that he -- he wasn't even allowed to meaningfully participate in --
03-287 +++$+++ 6089 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And he's saying it violates the Constitution in two respects: one, they won't listen to me; and two, they apply the 1998 guidelines.
03-287 +++$+++ 6090 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's essentially it.
03-287 +++$+++ 6091 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's it. Okay. We're talking now about this 2005 hearing and he wants new procedures, and the question is, is this 1983 or is it habeas?
03-287 +++$+++ 6092 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's -- that's correct.
03-287 +++$+++ 6093 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
03-287 +++$+++ 6094 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and it is section 1983 because it doesn't violate the Heck rule. This --
03-287 +++$+++ 6095 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what -- what is your -- what is Johnson's mootness argument?
03-287 +++$+++ 6096 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, to the extent in his complaint he was seeking a new parole hearing as a result of the challenge to the '99 decision, that's probably mooted because he has received this 2001 hearing and we just don't know enough about it to know whether he's going to challenge it or not. He'd have to amend his complaint in the district court.
03-287 +++$+++ 6097 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could -- is it possible that both Dotson and Johnson could get new hearings by -- filing habeas --
03-287 +++$+++ 6098 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so.
03-287 +++$+++ 6099 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- petition?
03-287 +++$+++ 6100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so. I don't think that Johnson has a Federal habeas remedy here because the Federal habeas statute is a challenge to the legality of custody, the legality of confinement, and that's not anything that he's challenging in this case.
03-287 +++$+++ 6101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What would you do if there was an allegation of a serious procedural flaw in a past hearing? The parole commission was -- was drunk or they read the wrong file or something, and it was just a challenge to the invalidity of the past hearing. Would that be 1983 or habeas?
03-287 +++$+++ 6102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that's a closer call, but I think it --
03-287 +++$+++ 6103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's why asked you. Why isn't it -- (Laughter.)
03-287 +++$+++ 6104 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. And -- and I -- I think it is still section 1983 if certain things are present. That is, is he going to necessarily imply the invalidity of the duration of his sentence by winning his case? And if that's meets the Heck rule and if he isn't, then I think he can proceed in section 1983.
03-287 +++$+++ 6105 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we have any case in which what was being -- what was sought to be challenged in a habeas action was not the duration of the sentence, but the procedure by which the duration of the sentence was determined?
03-287 +++$+++ 6106 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't --
03-287 +++$+++ 6107 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there any -- why -- why shouldn't that be a habeas action? Why shouldn't 1983 be limited to prison conditions, which is what we've always -- and referred to it as -- as that in the past?
03-287 +++$+++ 6108 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think in the hypothetical that you've presented, Justice Scalia, if the prisoner wins the case in that particular case, then his sentence is invalidated, and I think that's the important critical factor here.
03-287 +++$+++ 6109 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no, not necessarily. He -- he's just saying the parole hearing I got lacked due process safeguards. Had I had those safeguards, I might -- I might -- have been given a shorter sentence. I can't prove I would have. I'm not challenging the sentence really, but I want a new hearing. I didn't get due process. Give me a proper hearing because I might get out earlier. Why shouldn't that come under habeas?
03-287 +++$+++ 6110 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because it's not a challenge to the legality of the confinement.
03-287 +++$+++ 6111 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My law clerk found two cases which we've just looked at briefly. One is called Wilwerding v. Swenson and the other Johnson v. Avery where she says that in those two cases people were using habeas to challenge prison conditions even. Now, so there are -- there are two cases that, if she's right -- and she's usually right -- that -- that -- where habeas was used to challenge prison conditions. So I've thought, well, if they can use it, they certainly could use it here.
03-287 +++$+++ 6112 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, and I -- I think point with -- with both of those decisions is that the Heck rule did not come into play because the prisoners must have gone through and exhausted their State court remedies, and so there wasn't an issue as to whether they must bring their claim in habeas.
03-287 +++$+++ 6113 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. It was a different issue, but it said habeas could be brought.
03-287 +++$+++ 6114 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. I think the Court in -- in that particular case --
03-287 +++$+++ 6115 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So habeas could be brought here?
03-287 +++$+++ 6116 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so.
03-287 +++$+++ 6117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why not?
03-287 +++$+++ 6118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think there's a remedy in habeas for the respondent Johnson in this case because the first thing that's going to be asked when he goes to the Federal district court to seek habeas relief is, well, are you challenging the legality of your custody?
03-287 +++$+++ 6119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, and they say sure -- sure I am. I'm saying I had terms. You know, I was going to be here under conditions A, B, C, and A, B, C in my opinion mean I will be released sooner, and instead, they gave me D, E, F, and D, E, F means I'm likely to be released later. I can't guarantee it. That's what he'll say. He says I can't guarantee it, but I wouldn't be bringing this case if I didn't think at least it was a shot.
03-287 +++$+++ 6120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. And -- and -- but he's not necessarily challenging the legality of his custody.
03-287 +++$+++ 6121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but -- but that's part of the conclusion that we're going to have to reach to -- to resolve the case. Why isn't he? How is that that much different than if a judge -- let's assume, under a proper sentencing guideline scheme, the judge just uses the wrong guideline. The man is going to go to jail for either 5 or 10 years. We don't know which. But that's -- that's a classic habeas case. Here, he's going to stay in a prison for 5 or 10 years. We don't know which. Why isn't this a classic habeas case?
03-287 +++$+++ 6122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because I think in -- in the first hypothetical, Your Honor, that -- that you gave, the challenge, if successful, would -- would completely invalidate the sentence that he received. They'd have to redo the -- the sentence. And -- and I think that's the critical distinction in this case, is that when Johnson files his complaint, he has a 10- to 30-year sentence by the -- by the State court. If he wins, he still has a 10- to 30-year sentence.
03-287 +++$+++ 6123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it wouldn't completely invalidate the sentence. We know that he's still going to be held and he's going to be held in custody. It's a question of how long, which is exactly what this case is.
03-287 +++$+++ 6124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But in the hypothetical you propose, Justice Kennedy, the -- the prisoner was actually -- would be actually challenging the sentence he received, and by winning the case, he's going to undo the State court sentence.
03-287 +++$+++ 6125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, well, those cases happen to involve -- happen to involve sentences. This case doesn't involve a sentence. It involves an opportunity to have his sentence shortened. And if habeas can be brought for that, we would phrase it differently. We wouldn't say it would have to invalidate the sentence. We would say it would have to invalidate the proceeding that could have shortened his sentence. I grant you we can't use the same language we did in the earlier cases, but if this is properly a habeas action, then we -- we can get some language to make it fit.
03-287 +++$+++ 6126 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't -- I don't think it is properly a habeas action. I think even in the decisions where courts may have heard similar claims in habeas, I think it was a matter of just saying, well, the prisoner is already here. He's already exhausted all of his State court remedies. It doesn't really matter whether it's section 1983 or habeas.
03-287 +++$+++ 6127 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose we wrote an opinion that said, whatever the reasoning -- I don't know what it would be right now -- that said in the future your client should go ahead in 1983. I'm putting you in a slightly awkward position, so don't answer if you don't want to. But I mean, for the future all these cases will be brought in habeas. Now, suppose that's what the opinion said. We're absolutely making it clear just what the -- would there be any harm done?
03-287 +++$+++ 6128 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I think there would be.
03-287 +++$+++ 6129 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, what would that harm be?
03-287 +++$+++ 6130 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that by -- by having a rule of that sort, that it would be expanding the jurisdiction of habeas and it would start to swallow up otherwise cognizable section 1983 claims.
03-287 +++$+++ 6131 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And why would that be bad?
03-287 +++$+++ 6132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And why --
03-287 +++$+++ 6133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry?
03-287 +++$+++ 6134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why would that be bad?
03-287 +++$+++ 6135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, because the Congress has enacted a statute --
03-287 +++$+++ 6136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. But I mean, is -- I'm asking you a practical question as a practicing lawyer. Would it be bad?
03-287 +++$+++ 6137 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely it would.
03-287 +++$+++ 6138 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because?
03-287 +++$+++ 6139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because there's a statute that allows --
03-287 +++$+++ 6140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I mean, leaving aside -- Congress changed the statute. It says absolutely it's going to be habeas. Is there any bad consequence in the law?
03-287 +++$+++ 6141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's going to give States a license to violate civil rights that will otherwise not be protected under the statute.
03-287 +++$+++ 6142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We'll catch them in habeas.
03-287 +++$+++ 6143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but the -- the State exhaustion requirements in habeas are much tougher. Of course, the State wants them to have to go through State exhaustion.
03-287 +++$+++ 6144 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ah, so it comes down to that.
03-287 +++$+++ 6145 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's really the critical --
03-287 +++$+++ 6146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You said -- you said a moment ago that it would be expanding habeas, and I'd like you to expand on that. It would be expanding habeas, I am assuming, because in every successful habeas case, the ultimate remedy that the court can order, if the State does not snap to it, is the immediate release of the prisoner. And I take it when you said it would expand habeas, it would expand it because this would not be an immediate release case no matter what. Is that correct?
03-287 +++$+++ 6147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-287 +++$+++ 6148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
03-287 +++$+++ 6149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You would basically end up going to a Federal district court seeking habeas relief asking for processes to be changed prospectively.
03-287 +++$+++ 6150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's why they could not bring habeas in this case because if they won, they still would not have shown anything that entitled to them to get out now or get out now unless the State within 30 days does something. Is -- is that the nub of it?
03-287 +++$+++ 6151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's -- that's really it, Justice Souter.
03-287 +++$+++ 6152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm -- I'm not sure. It depends how you formulate the order. The -- the judge says, I'm going to order this prisoner released unless, within 6 months, he has a parole hearing under the guidelines I set. That's the way the habeas statute works.
03-287 +++$+++ 6153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if that's the relief that the -- the prisoner was seeking, I think that is clearly a habeas claim. But that's not what Johnson is claiming in this case. He's not asking for entitlement to release at all. He's asking for the processes to be changed prospectively for future parole hearings, and he's asking for declaratory relief.
03-287 +++$+++ 6154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Regardless of what he's asking for, if he got what he wanted, he still would not be entitled to any immediate release.
03-287 +++$+++ 6155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's absolutely correct.
03-287 +++$+++ 6156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He would still have a sentence of X years, and the question is, how often are we going to look at him to decide when, within X years, we may let him out. Is that --
03-287 +++$+++ 6157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's -- that's absolutely it. He cannot -- by winning his case, he's not going to shorten his sentence in any way. And that's -- that's a big distinction from the Balisok case where there was an automatic entitlement to a shorter sentence --
03-287 +++$+++ 6158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, he might --
03-287 +++$+++ 6159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- for Balisok in that case.
03-287 +++$+++ 6160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- he might shorten the term of his confinement.
03-287 +++$+++ 6161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Might but not necessarily. And this Court made very clear most recently in the Nelson decision --
03-287 +++$+++ 6162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you could say the same thing when you're challenging the sentence. He might but he might not. We're just -- we're just hearing the case.
03-287 +++$+++ 6163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think a challenge to the sentence necessarily invalidates that sentence if you win. But a challenge to parole is much different because you're not affecting the sentence if you win your case. And the term necessary is completely necessary to the Heck analysis, as this Court made clear most recently in the Nelson case from last term.
03-287 +++$+++ 6164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's the nub of it I guess. The fact that he may be granted parole has no implication for the validity of the sentence.
03-287 +++$+++ 6165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's absolutely right.
03-287 +++$+++ 6166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In fact, it assumes the sentence is valid, but that he will probably stay clean if he gets out. That's all it means, isn't it?
03-287 +++$+++ 6167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's really all it means. And this Court last term in Muhammad in -- in footnote 1 made clear that the incarceration that matters for this analysis is the -- in the incarceration of the sentence from the State court. And I think that's -- that's what the Court needs to look at, is what is Johnson's effect on the State court judgment or sentence. What's the necessary implications? Not in this case at all. And really, this case I think has already been decided by Wolff. It's something that the petitioners sort of don't mention too much in their briefs. In Wolff, the prisoners in -- in that case were trying to get their good-time credits back. I think this is an easier case than the Wolff decision. And what the Court did was parse out, okay, you can't get your good-time credits back, but you can seek prospective injunctive relief to fix the processes that are used in connection with depriving prisoners of good-time credits. And that's precisely what Johnson is seeking here. Your Honor, the other thing I wanted to mention was the notion -- Your Honors, the other thing I want to mention was the notion that there's no State review of these decisions. The Prison Litigation Reform Act clearly provides for State administrative review of even challenges to the process. So the -- the State of Ohio could easily set up an appeal process administratively to -- to correct that problem.
03-287 +++$+++ 6168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
03-287 +++$+++ 6169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you.
03-287 +++$+++ 6179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cole, you have about 4 and a half minutes left.
03-287 +++$+++ 6182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what's your position as to whether or not it's moot?
03-287 +++$+++ 6183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, we don't believe it's moot either, and in -- in fact, for two reasons. First, once again, it's threatening consequences for an existing decision, albeit it not the one that was originally threatened or where invalidity would be implied below, but there is a new one where that would have that consequence. In terms of bad consequences, I think the single biggest bad consequence of directing these prisoners to 1983 rather than habeas is it's going to deprive them of the opportunity for meaningful relief in Ohio's courts. The Layne decision in the last -- decided just 2 years ago, three prisoners brought a declaratory judgment action about the way parole works in Ohio. They were successful and their case resulted in 3,000 prisoners receiving --
03-287 +++$+++ 6184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but you raise deprivation of the benefit they would get from the Ohio courts. If they wanted that benefit, they could have brought a 1983 action in State courts. State courts have jurisdiction. So it's a little odd for you to say, oh, they're being deprived of a benefit when they're telling you by this very lawsuit they don't want it.
03-287 +++$+++ 6185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true, Your Honor. At the same time, this -- bringing this -- this case in 1983 in Federal court means that they're not going to be able to get injunctive relief on State grounds under the Pennhurst doctrine. So they are depriving themselves of a chance to get that type of meaningful relief that Ohio courts are offering and that courts in other States are offering. The other -- the other point I wanted to make is that with respect to Petitioner Johnson's argument, his understanding of sentence, that if it doesn't impact the sentence, it can't be in habeas, would mean that parole revocations can't be in habeas either. A parole -- parole -- when you're on parole, you're still serving part of your sentence, as he understands it, part of the initial term that the court has imposed upon you. Granted, you're not doing it in prison, but a parole revocation wouldn't impact your sentence. It would merely bring you back into prison to serve the remainder of your sentence rather than having you serve it on the street. So I think that understanding of sentence can't make sense for -- for habeas purposes.
03-287 +++$+++ 6186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think sentence means custody. Don't you think it means custody?
03-287 +++$+++ 6187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but to the extent we're talking --
03-287 +++$+++ 6188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The custody you've been sentenced to?
03-287 +++$+++ 6189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But to the extent we're talking about duration of custody or duration of confinement, again, the claims here do have a -- success on the claims here would have a meaningful impact on the duration of confinement. This Court in Muhammad said -- I think this is probably the -- the closest quote on point -- challenges to particulars affecting the duration of confinement are the province of habeas corpus. This is a challenge to a particular, the parole procedures, that's affecting the duration of their confinement. Or at least that's their allegations, and that's what success on their claims is going to mean. And because of those durational consequences, as well as because of the consequences of success on the merits for previous State parole decisions, we believe that those claims are better routed to habeas than to 1983. If there are no further questions.
03-287 +++$+++ 6190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I had one further question. Are you asking us to change anything in Wolff against McDonnell, or can we follow that case?
03-287 +++$+++ 6191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think we can follow that case as it's been reinterpreted in Heck. Wolff said that -- well, Heck said that Wolff was about challenges that would not -- and I believe the language is -- necessarily vitiate the underlying decision. So the way Heck understood Wolff was that the procedural challenges there, with regard to the prospective relief they were seeking, were not the type of relief that would necessarily vitiate any decision that had already been made. Here, by contrast, the claims that they're bringing, the ex post facto claims, if they're successful on the merits, would necessarily vitiate the decisions that have gone before. Thank you, Your Honors.
03-287 +++$+++ 6192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Cole. The case is submitted.
03-388 +++$+++ 6196 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument in Bates against Dow AgroSciences. Mr. Frederick.
03-388 +++$+++ 6198 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Pesticides are economic poisons designed to kill living things. Sometimes they do not work as designed. For more than a century until the 1990's, courts routinely permitted farmers to bring claims against pesticide manufacturers for crop damage caused by pesticides. In enacting amendments to FIFRA in 1972, Congress did not intend to displace those preexisting State law remedies. The farmers here allege claims for defective design, defective manufacturing, fraud, breach of warranty, and failure to warn for a brand new product that severely damaged their peanut crops. I'd like to start with our narrowest theories for reversal and demonstrate for three reasons why those claims survive preemption. The defective design and manufacturing claims challenge the product's composition, not its label. The fraud, warranty, and negligence claims involve general legal duties, not pesticide-specific requirements, and the failure to warn and fraud claims are not different from or in addition to FIFRA requirements. Now, with respect to the first point, Dow concedes at pages 43 and 49 of its brief that defective design and manufacturing claims generally are not preempted. That concession warrants a remand here, as this case was decided before discovery, enable the farmers to develop their claims.
03-388 +++$+++ 6199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But couldn't you make every failure to warn claim a defective design claim? That is, they didn't warn about the effects, but those effects would not have been present if the product had been designed to assure that there wouldn't be any adverse effect on the peanut crop.
03-388 +++$+++ 6200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the way the Restatement of Torts and Product Liability in sections 1 and 2 describe, there are basically three theories that products liability claims can proceed on: a defective design, defective manufacturing, and defective warnings. The restatement explains that they are distinct legal theories that go to different problems that the manufacturer has caused with respect to the product. A defective design claim asserts that the composition was inadequate and that a properly designed product could have been put on the market that would not cause the harm.
03-388 +++$+++ 6201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Frederick, on the defective design claim, presumably that's based on a factual theory that Dow could have reasonably designed Strongarm to be safe for growing peanuts in high-acid soil.
03-388 +++$+++ 6202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct.
03-388 +++$+++ 6203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But doesn't that mean your client should have to put forward some evidence establishing a material issue of disputed fact on that point?
03-388 +++$+++ 6204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Certainly, but here --
03-388 +++$+++ 6205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it didn't do that.
03-388 +++$+++ 6206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well here, Your Honor, the motion for summary judgment that Dow filed was not based on the merits of the claims. It was based on them being preempted, displaced as a matter of Federal law. They also asserted a limitation of -- of remedy provision. But we never had discovery in this case. The District Court, after finding jurisdiction, considered Dow's motion for summary judgment on preemption and locked us out of the courthouse door before we ever had a chance to prove that a safer design for the product could have been made. And that's where we think the court's decision below was overbroad and should be reversed.
03-388 +++$+++ 6207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the problem I have with -- with the Government's case and with the respondent's case is that -- it's really the obverse of what Justice Ginsburg said. Their problem is that they would recast everything as a warning.
03-388 +++$+++ 6208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's absolutely correct.
03-388 +++$+++ 6209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does the restatement have some specific provisions that say no matter how good the warning is, you're still entitled to proceed when there's a -- I don't know -- dangerous product or defective product or something?
03-388 +++$+++ 6210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Restatement sections 1 and 2 address this, and what the restatement says is that if you can show that the product could have been reformulated to be properly designed, then the existence of a warning that might go to certain of its uses would not negate a defective design claim. The Texas Supreme Court --
03-388 +++$+++ 6211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Even -- even if the warning specifically covered that design defect?
03-388 +++$+++ 6212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that's -- that's correct. And what the restatement --
03-388 +++$+++ 6213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So even if this product said, warning: may not be effective in high pH soils, that's not good enough?
03-388 +++$+++ 6214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under the restatement rule, which Texas has adopted in the Uniroyal case, which we've cited in our brief I think at page 47, that is true because the restatement explains that there are certain warnings that could be ignored or not observed or not understood properly and that if it can be proved that a properly designed product would be on the market, there are public policy reasons why that's what we want to encourage manufacturers to do. I mean, under --
03-388 +++$+++ 6215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At any cost? I mean, what if it -- you know, yes, I can -- I can sell you stuff that will -- that will work in high pH soil, but it's going to be three times as effective. Do I have to sell it?
03-388 +++$+++ 6216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the --
03-388 +++$+++ 6217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can't I just sell it for those people who don't need it for -- for high pH soil at a third the price with a warning that says, hey, by the way, don't use this in high pH soil? It's crazy to say you can't do that.
03-388 +++$+++ 6218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, to answer your question in several ways, that's a jury determination to -- to ascertain the reasonableness of the alternate design that the manufacturer would be asked to -- to do or to market a separate product that was separately designed for high-acid soils.
03-388 +++$+++ 6219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's never a question of the reasonableness or the adequacy of the warning?
03-388 +++$+++ 6220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think it's a question of warning in this sense, Justice Kennedy. If you take their theory, which is that a defective design claim always collapses to a failure to warn, they can put out a defectively designed product that admittedly causes harm, and all they have to do is change the label and say, if used in these particular circumstances, it may cause harm, because that would necessitate a change to the label --
03-388 +++$+++ 6221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, not necessarily. It wouldn't be always either way. I would think that if in fact you have a product and the product causes harm in a subset of cases, which you could warn against, then a jury could decide whether the unreasonableness consists of not having designed the super-safe product or the unreasonableness consists of not having had a different label.
03-388 +++$+++ 6222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that -- there are -- that's why the restatement makes clear that there are distinctive theories for defect --
03-388 +++$+++ 6223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you're arguing that in this case you have the first.
03-388 +++$+++ 6224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
03-388 +++$+++ 6225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It seems implausible on -- you know, --
03-388 +++$+++ 6226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we have both actually.
03-388 +++$+++ 6227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- because all they'd have to do is don't use it in pH soil.
03-388 +++$+++ 6228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. We have defective warning too, and -- and if I can address that as well. The statute here prohibits in section 136q(1) any false or misleading statement in the label as to any particular. Our position is that the 2000 label said, suitable for peanut-growing areas in all places where peanuts are grown. That was false. Under the statute, that is a misbranding, and that is actionable as -- both as a failure to warn, as a fraud claim, and as a breach of warranty. Now, the Medtronic majority made absolutely clear that that kind of claim is not preempted, and in fact all nine Justices agreed that when the State law claim is parallel to the Federal requirements, the existence of a State law remedy is not an additional requirement.
03-388 +++$+++ 6229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So on -- on that aspect of the case, you put in your pleadings that this was a violation of FIFRA.
03-388 +++$+++ 6230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't necessarily need to say a violation of FIFRA is -- so long as the requirement is the same, although we can certainly --
03-388 +++$+++ 6231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's a -- that's a bit different. You were -- you were asserting a moment ago I thought -- please correct me if I'm wrong -- that this was a violation of FIFRA because it was misbranded.
03-388 +++$+++ 6232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I --
03-388 +++$+++ 6233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It seems to me that you then have a suit under FIFRA, but I don't think that was the theory of your complaint.
03-388 +++$+++ 6234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. The theory of our complaint was a failure to warn both for negligence and as a defective product.
03-388 +++$+++ 6235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the reason for that, I take it, is that FIFRA does not -- I mean, I think you agree FIFRA does not provide an independent private right of action.
03-388 +++$+++ 6236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
03-388 +++$+++ 6237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you've got to sue under State law, but you would -- you would kind of have a slam dunk for your position, I suppose, if your pleading said, the failure to warn only to the extent that in fact the -- the warning given in compliance with FIFRA was an inadequate warning. That would -- that would keep you within the -- the -- in effect, the -- the Federal limit, and it would also make clear that you had a State law cause of action, not a Federal cause of action.
03-388 +++$+++ 6238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, and because --
03-388 +++$+++ 6239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and that's in effect what you're arguing.
03-388 +++$+++ 6240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. And -- and because of the preliminary of this suit, Justice Kennedy, we certainly should have the opportunity to amend our complaint. There are counterclaims that this is done at the motion for declaratory judgment.
03-388 +++$+++ 6241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In your view -- in your -- your opinion, if you were to follow that, would EPA -- suppose EPA does the following. EPA looks into this and they publish a reg that says in this case or in this subset of cases, or some kind of description that fits yours, we think that the labeling should be thus and so and we think that State tort suits will interfere with our ability to promote the uniform labeling and therefore they're preempted. Can the EPA do that on your theory?
03-388 +++$+++ 6242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, it can and the -- the interesting aspect of this, Justice Breyer, is that of course EPA hasn't done that. EPA has made very clear it never tested for efficacy. It never even gave notice and comment so that --
03-388 +++$+++ 6243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, EPA has -- has waived efficacy data requirements. Right?
03-388 +++$+++ 6244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-388 +++$+++ 6245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, is it your position that a State can pass a law requiring labels to have efficacy claims?
03-388 +++$+++ 6246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They have to do it pursuant to their powers under 136v(a) which is the regulation of sale or use or under 136v(c) which says that when a State designates a particular locality requirement and a special need, it can impose a label -- it can impose requirements that the manufacturer has to comply with. Now, the EPA importantly -- and this is in their regulations at 163.152 -- has specifically said that States have labeling authority. The States can impose labeling requirements. Now, there's no reason why --
03-388 +++$+++ 6247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you're not relying on that in this cause of action.
03-388 +++$+++ 6248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice -- no, Justice O'Connor, except to the extent that if the State can affirmatively do it through a positive regulation, their theory has to be wrong that the -- that any incidental effect that induces a change to label is preempted. That theory has to be wrong, and that's what the Fifth Circuit relied on.
03-388 +++$+++ 6249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, does -- does FIFRA require the manufacturer to say on the label what the item can be used for?
03-388 +++$+++ 6250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but I want to address --
03-388 +++$+++ 6251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So how -- how does an express warranty claim escape preemption --
03-388 +++$+++ 6252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As the --
03-388 +++$+++ 6253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- where -- where Dow just says the federally mandated statement is included on my label and it's true?
03-388 +++$+++ 6254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A warranty claim, Justice O'Connor, as this Court made clear in the Cipollone case, is not a requirement under State law because it's a voluntary contractual arrangement between the parties. The Court I think has made clear that what has to be ascertained here is does the State cause of action or the State law create a requirement. That's not true in the warranty case because FIFRA doesn't speak to requirements in -- as to warranties. It speaks to requirements in other ways. So what Dow did here with its warranty was completely voluntary, and the fact that it breached that warranty by putting on the market a product that was not suitable for the use in all areas where peanuts are grown is a breach of a warranty that it voluntarily undertook. Breach of that is not a requirement imposed under State law. And that has been, I think, verified by seven Justices of this Court in the -- in the Cipollone case. Now, if I could speak to the fraud claim, it is important to understand that in both Cipollone and in a footnote in Medtronic, the Court made clear that where there are general legal duties that are not observed by the manufacturer that don't go to the specific product itself, those claims are not preempted. Here our assertion is that Dow put on the market a -- a product that was mislabeled and that they went out and told people fraudulently was suitable for their uses. We acted in reliance on that and we suffered damages. Those are general legal duties, not pesticide-specific ones. And the existence of the preemption clause of 136v(b) does not displace us from the opportunity to try to prove to a court that fraud was committed here. Now, if I could briefly address two points. One is that the inducement to change theory should be rejected. That was the basis on which the Fifth Circuit decided this case and it is an overly broad theory for several reasons. First, it's not supported by the text of 136v(b) which says requirements for labeling. It doesn't say requirements that induce a change to the label. And that's how many of the courts have gone off track since the Cipollone decision was announced by this Court. They have read FIFRA as saying just because the word requirements is 136v(b), thereby any State law claim that imposes a requirement that might induce a manufacturer to change the label is thereby preempted. We think that's overly broad because it confers way too much discretion on manufacturers to decide what to put on labels, and they can claim immunity for any overly broad claim of efficacy so long as when they are sued, they can say we're induced to change the label. Because EPA does not evaluate the specific contents with respect to efficacy or the claims that are made on -- on a label, if a manufacturer makes an overly ambitious statement as to efficacy, all the manufacturer has to do under the inducement to change theory is go to court and say we would have to change the label and thereby 136v(b) preempts it. Now, I'd also like to stress that the other side's theory creates a huge regulatory gap. As your question, Justice O'Connor, noted, the EPA does not evaluate efficacy on the front end. And in fact, the history behind these provisions is that EPA understood from the very beginning that common law claims would serve an important incidental regulatory effect. If we could review the history for a moment. Prior to the 1972 changes to FIFRA, for decades farmers had brought claims against manufacturers for design defect, for failure to warn, for the kinds of common law claims that we have asserted in this case. It was so well established by 1972 that there was a huge section in the American Law Reports that annotated all the cases and explained what the common law duties of pesticide manufacturers were. Yet, notwithstanding that, when Congress enacted the 1972 act, despite thousands of pages of hearings, committee reports, legislative debates, there is not one mention of any effort to displace those preexisting common law claims. And when EPA, in discharging its responsibilities under the 1972 act, got overwhelmed by the requirement that it re-register products that were already out on the market, pursuant to the 1972 act's standards, it very promptly went to Congress and said, you should waive efficacy requirements because we simply can't do this. Congress responded, but importantly in the administrations on both sides, EPA has always understood except until just a couple of years ago when the Solicitor General changed the position of the Government, that these kinds of incidental common law suits would have an important regulatory effect. If we could just take the case of DDT. For 30 years, manufacturers were sued for DDT and awarded damages until it became clear that the groundswell over the course of decades that DDT needed to be banned, and it was only at the back end that the expert agency regulators determined that in fact the product needed to be banned, but that was only after a very long history in which common law suits had provided remedies to farmers and others who were harmed by that product. Now, in 1982, the Reagan administration's EPA expanded the efficacy waiver and it included far greater products than had been done in the Carter administration in 1979. And in the Federal Register notice announcing that it was intending to expand that efficacy waiver, the EPA in 1982 said the reason why we think this can be done is because suits can be brought against manufacturers who put on the market ineffective products. We cited that on page 31 of our brief.
03-388 +++$+++ 6255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But do you take the position that juries can do what a State regulation cannot do, or are they much -- are they on a par?
03-388 +++$+++ 6256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, our broadest theory, Justice Kennedy, is that the word requirements in 136v(b) doesn't include common law claims at all.
03-388 +++$+++ 6257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose we disagree with that.
03-388 +++$+++ 6258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you disagree with that, then they would have to be the same, and that's why our point about the existence of the parallel requirements is the same. I want to address the point of the discordance between what State juries can decide and what State regulators can decide because Dow and the Government have featured that in their case. The Government in the Medtronic case at page 27 of its amicus brief there said there was no problem to be had with juries rendering supposedly inconsistent decisions so long as they were following one Federal standard. The Federal standard here is clear: falsity. Tell the truth. That's what manufacturers are obliged to do under the statute and under the regulations.
03-388 +++$+++ 6259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's their strong point. So what is the response to that? Because you can easily get two juries in different parts of the country to decide absolutely opposite things as to what the label should say, and in those circumstances, they say, well, they're in an impossible situation and that's why Congress passed this statute, to be sure it would be EPA and not two juries in different places.
03-388 +++$+++ 6260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ First, the juries -- unlike a -- a declaratory judgment or an injunctive type remedy, Justice Breyer, a jury for a common law damages claim is not saying what affirmatively should be on the labels.
03-388 +++$+++ 6261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm speaking practically. And I don't have to go into all the argument.
03-388 +++$+++ 6262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure.
03-388 +++$+++ 6263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You know the argument. It's a very familiar argument.
03-388 +++$+++ 6264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. The answer is that -- that Congress was prepared to accept a certain level of disuniformity when it enacted 136v because it made very clear in sandwiching the preemption provision of 136b -- surround -- by (a) and (c) that it was prepared to allow States to depart in significant respects from what was nationally uniform. And the way it did so was to say States can regulate sale or use and they can also impose extra requirements for special locations. Now, what Dow did here I think illustrates the way the system is supposed to work, which is that when a problem was identified with their product in the States of Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, within 7 months it petitioned the EPA to append to its national uniform label a supplemental label. And that supplemental label says it is for distribution in those three States only and it provided 10 important changes to the label that it otherwise had as a nationally uniform label. That's how the system is supposed to work. If the incidental regulatory effect of jury verdicts or common law claims induces or causes some kind of change to the label, that can be done without an adverse effect to national uniformity through the supplemental labeling process. And what Dow did here was it has its label and then it attaches the supplemental label that addresses the particular conditions that exist in the State. And the EPA has recognized that as a perfectly appropriate and valid way to address the geographic, environmental, and climatic conditions that exist in the different regions of the country that engage in agriculture. There's nothing that is uncertain about that if you accept the premise of the Government's argument in Medtronic, which is that juries can be properly instructed, if it came to that, so that they could follow the appropriate Federal standard. Now, I would like to turn -- sorry. Did you -- no, go ahead. I would like to turn briefly to the -- the requirements aspect of the case because we do think that, under our broadest theory, this is a different situation than Medtronic and Cipollone, and because of the important statutory indications that are in the provision 136v. Unlike in Medtronic, there is an explicit provision that is a non-preempted provision, and that is different from Medtronic. Where in Medtronic there was a provision that allowed the FDA to impose its own decisions as to requirements and whether or not the States should be displaced, here Congress made the determination in 136v(a) and in (c) that those kinds of requirements can be imposed. They're in addition to what the Federal standard is. That means that you have to look at requirements in a somewhat different way because the States have this authority that they did not have under the Medical Device Amendments. There's a textual indicator under (b) also which refers to (a) in the sense that (b) says such State that shall issue these requirements. Such -- the meaning of it in Webster's means what has been already described -- is in (a), and in (a) the States are authorized to promulgate regulations. So we think that there is a textual basis for distinguishing the word requirements that this Court -- five Justices in this Court in Medtronic said would encompass common law claims. If there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to reserve the balance --
03-388 +++$+++ 6265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me ask one because I think you'll hear some variation of this, and you have a minute, which is the -- the statute sets up a perfectly good way of keeping this branded stuff off the market. All any complaining farmer has to do is to go to EPA and ask them to pull it, and pulling it is an unbelievable sanction. It's like the atomic bomb on the company. And so that's very strong. And the only thing that leaves out is the possibility of damage remedies, but if you want your damage remedy, just go to EPA and tell them to give it to you because they can write the rule the other way that I was suggesting.
03-388 +++$+++ 6266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't think that EPA could write a rule requiring damages to be done. It doesn't have the statutory authority --
03-388 +++$+++ 6267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They would just say it doesn't preempt.
03-388 +++$+++ 6268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there's no indication here that EPA can do that kind of thing. In FIFRA, it certainly doesn't have that kind of provision. I mean, certainly there are different ways that the statute could have been written. That isn't the choice that Congress made. Thank you.
03-388 +++$+++ 6269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Waxman.
03-388 +++$+++ 6271 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: FIFRA's preemption provision, which Congress specifically amended in 1978 to add the title uniformity, preempts by its terms, quote, requirements for labeling different from those required under FIFRA.
03-388 +++$+++ 6272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why -- why doesn't the other amendment limit your argument? Because Congress has also passed an amendment to the effect that unless EPA chooses to get in to the business of -- of passing on efficacy, it -- it need not do so. And in fact we know it is not doing so. Why, therefore, doesn't the uniformity argument go to those subjects that EPA does review for and why doesn't the subject of efficacy, in effect, drop out of -- of the -- the whole preemption claim?
03-388 +++$+++ 6273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There are -- there are two fundamental reasons. The first is that it is a principal requirement of FIFRA, and has been since 1972 and remains, that a manufacturer may only sell a registered pesticide with the precise labeling to the word and font size that EPA has approved, and that requirement applies whether the wording relates to human safety, environmental protection, or efficacy. Now, the specific amendment in 1978 was, as Mr. Frederick indicated, represented a representation by EPA to Congress -- and Congress' -- the -- the committee report plainly indicates this -- that the EPA was not saying we are no longer regulating efficacy, we are no longer concerned with efficacy. What they said was because the Department of Agriculture and the extension services and the State universities are all involved in this and, in particular, are involved in the statutory requirement that before a manufacturer can even apply for registration, even submit a registration application, the manufacturer must do extensive, rigorous efficacy testing, which Congress has indicated correctly is very expensive --
03-388 +++$+++ 6274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it's not monitored at all. The -- the manufacturer can say -- make up reports and EPA is never going to look at it.
03-388 +++$+++ 6275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the manufacturer makes up reports, it has committed a felony. EPA can enforce it. It can refer it to the Attorney General. It's just like the --
03-388 +++$+++ 6276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But maybe it isn't a labeling violation. I mean, there are claims made here that I have trouble shoehorning into your theory. For instance, why does a claim that Dow negligently failed to field test its product on peanuts on acid soil impose a label requirement?
03-388 +++$+++ 6277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice --
03-388 +++$+++ 6278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I just don't understand that.
03-388 +++$+++ 6279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice O'Connor, I think -- I will address the negligent testing and, of course, the design defect --
03-388 +++$+++ 6280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-388 +++$+++ 6281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- discussion that's figured so prominently in my colleague's argument. It's very, very important to understand that unlike in Sprietsma and Medtronic and so many of the -- and, for that matter, with respect to the preempted claims in Cipollone, the claims that were preempted below, we didn't file a rule 12 motion to dismiss. We couldn't have with respect to at least one of those two claims. We filed a motion for summary judgment that said with respect to -- let me take design defect first. With respect to design defect, it is possible under Texas State law to state a claim for products liability under defective design without impeaching the labeling. And there is a brief filed in this case by Dean Powers, the University of Texas Law School, for the -- the Texas Chemistry Council who's an expert on Texas tort law, and he goes through the Texas torts in detail to show why they are all preempted and all invalid under independent and adequate State grounds. But what we did is we didn't move to dismiss. We filed a motion for summary judgment, and in that motion for summary judgment, we pointed the respondents in this case to this Court's decision in Celotex v. Catrett, and we said, in effect, we know that you can allege a design defect claim without impeaching the labeling, but we think that what you are complaining about does impeach the labeling. Therefore, show us what you have. Now, under rule 56, they had two alternatives. They could have filed an affidavit or a request under rule 56(f), as this Court referenced in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, and said, hey, we don't know how this was made. We don't know how this was tested. We don't know how this was manufactured. We're entitled to discovery, and district courts recognize that all the time. What they did --
03-388 +++$+++ 6282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And they didn't do that?
03-388 +++$+++ 6283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They did not do that, and what they did was to submit affidavits and documentary evidence, including expert affidavits.
03-388 +++$+++ 6284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, you said they didn't file a motion to dismiss. I thought you brought the lawsuit.
03-388 +++$+++ 6285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We brought the lawsuit and we --
03-388 +++$+++ 6286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But then they couldn't file --
03-388 +++$+++ 6287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no. I said we didn't file a motion to dismiss --
03-388 +++$+++ 6288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You didn't file a motion to dismiss your own complaint?
03-388 +++$+++ 6289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. Their counterclaims.
03-388 +++$+++ 6290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, okay.
03-388 +++$+++ 6291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, this wasn't decided -- Mr. Frederick's reply brief talks over and over and over again about how this was decided on the pleadings, and you know, there was no discovery allowed. Under rule 56, they could have asked for discovery when we basically said, okay, let's show our hands. We got two jacks. What do you got? And what their expert said and what their response said was if the 2001 amended label had been on it, we wouldn't have been injured. Now, rule 56(c) says that when you oppose a summary judgment motion with affidavit evidence, the burden is on the adverse -- the adverse party must by affidavits, or otherwise provided in this rule, set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial, and they didn't do that. Now, the classic design defect -- let me -- let me give you an example.
03-388 +++$+++ 6292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let's just try to boil it down a little bit for my purposes. Do you concede that there could be a claim based on no testing --
03-388 +++$+++ 6293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-388 +++$+++ 6294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that there could be a claim based on design defect, that there could be a claim saying there were off-label oral statements made that amounted to fraud or misleading --
03-388 +++$+++ 6295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'll take them in your precise order.
03-388 +++$+++ 6296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
03-388 +++$+++ 6297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Under Texas law -- and the Court of Appeals opinion, the Grinnell opinion cited by the Court of Appeals opinion, says this, as does Dean Powers. Under Texas law, negligent testing is not an independent tort. It is of necessity a subset of inadequate warnings. It is an element of a -- the tort -- the claim of product defect related to warnings. And so it is not possible under Texas law, settled Texas law. Other States are different, but Texas in its sovereign capacity has chosen to make claims of negligent testing an element of the tort of defective product by failure to warn, and that --
03-388 +++$+++ 6298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the way you proceeded in this case, you made it clear that it would be impossible for the Texas court itself to weigh in on this because you jumped the gun. They wanted to proceed in Texas court, and then we would have known what Texas law was on these subjects. You said, no, we want to be in the Federal forum.
03-388 +++$+++ 6299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We want -- as the -- as the Fifth Circuit found and the District Court found, we filed a declaratory judgment in Texas after we received their demand letters because we wanted this to be adjudicated in a single forum, which the Texas venue rules would not have allowed, and we -- we actually filed this in Lubbock, Texas, which is the geographic center of where these 29 farmers operate. Now, with respect to defective design, yes, under Texas law if they had a -- they have to allege and they have to prove that there is a safer alternative design for this product, which they never even introduced one quantum of evidence about. But --
03-388 +++$+++ 6300 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me you're -- you're arguing the merits of the tort claims rather than the preemption issue.
03-388 +++$+++ 6301 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what we said was your claims are preempted if they impeach the labeling that we are required by Federal law to use.
03-388 +++$+++ 6302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But they now say they don't. They ought to be able to proceed on those claims. What do we do with that?
03-388 +++$+++ 6303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what this -- what -- what happens under rule 56 --
03-388 +++$+++ 6304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And also the -- also the claims of false, misleading statements outside the label.
03-388 +++$+++ 6305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I'm going to get to the false and misleading statements outside the labeling in a minute, but just to finish the design defect point, they filed a complaint -- a counterclaim which had as a count this was defectively designed. It is possible under Texas law to prove that something is defectively designed. If they had come in and said, but we filed a motion for summary judgment that says here's our evidence and we don't think that you can satisfy -- that you are, in fact, complaining about a defective design --
03-388 +++$+++ 6306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if they did allege a defective design claim under Texas law, would that have been preempted?
03-388 +++$+++ 6307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. If -- if they had said, look, the problem with this, which as footnote 9 of our brief indicates, it's not a --
03-388 +++$+++ 6308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me your argument is not whether there's preemption. It's whether there's a State cause of -- State law cause of action.
03-388 +++$+++ 6309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no. It's -- it's both. With respect to defective design, what we said is, your claim is preempted because you aren't going to go to the jury on defective design without impeaching the label. If we're wrong, prove it in response to our summary judgment submission.
03-388 +++$+++ 6310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you can --
03-388 +++$+++ 6311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that their burden?
03-388 +++$+++ 6312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is --
03-388 +++$+++ 6313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that their burden or is your burden to show --
03-388 +++$+++ 6314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is -- it is absolutely their burden in -- as the responding party to a motion for summary judgment, to show that there are material facts that are either in dispute or there are material facts that would allow them to go to the jury.
03-388 +++$+++ 6315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But on your theory there is no material fact, it seems to me, because your -- what you say they cannot make good on that claim without impeaching the label.
03-388 +++$+++ 6316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And they --
03-388 +++$+++ 6317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Every time they sue on the -- on the ground that -- let's say, that -- that the -- the actual use was inconsistent with what the label described, you could say, gee, if their theory is correct, we'd have to change our label to say that what's on the label now is in fact not properly descriptive of the product. So it's not a -- a question of needing more fact. On your theory, whenever they, in effect, sue on the basis of what you say, your response is going to be, as a matter of law, well, if they're correct, we'd have to say something else. That impeaches the label. Therefore, preemption.
03-388 +++$+++ 6318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is exactly right. What they could have done in response to our motion for summary judgment is to say this product assertedly harms -- when it is applied before the seed is planted, will harm the product it is -- the plant that it's supposed to protect if the soil pH is too high. They could have easily have come back and said if they had a -- a design defect claim that didn't impeach the label to say you should have -- there was a way to manufacture this product. You could have it in pellet form rather than in the soluble form or if the problem was the alkalinity of the soil, there is a way to design this so that it is dissolved in a more acidic solution. The classic case, which is referenced in the NRDC brief, which has many, many examples of true design defect claims that don't impeach labels, is a case involving rat poison. It's a case called Banks v. ICI America. It's a Georgia Supreme Court --
03-388 +++$+++ 6319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you quite clearly have both. I understand that. Let me ask you a question about the -- the preemption point because what I think they're saying is go read the red brief, your brief, pages 6 and 7, and there you see a statutory requirement and you see regulatory requirements, regulation. And I think one of their claims is we are arguing that that statutory requirement, without any change in the regulatory, that -- that it was violated. These are false. They're misbranded. So we are not imposing a requirement different from or in addition to the requirement of Federal law. We are enforcing a requirement that is the same as the requirement of Federal law, and if, by the way, the EPA were to think that tort suits in those circumstances in practice are too disuniform, let them promulgate a regulation to that effect. But they haven't. Now, what -- what is the answer to that argument?
03-388 +++$+++ 6320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The answer is threefold. Number one, a challenge to a -- the wording of a statement on the label on the grounds that it is false and misleading is -- does impose a requirement different than Federal law, not the requirement that -- that labeling not be false and misleading, but the fundamental requirement that a -- unless and until the EPA says otherwise, the manufacturer can only sell this product with the precise labeling that EPA has approved. And it -- if you look at page 63a --
03-388 +++$+++ 6321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman, do I --
03-388 +++$+++ 6322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- of the joint appendix --
03-388 +++$+++ 6323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman, do I take it from what you have just said that there is no -- even though the statute prohibits misbranding, that there is no way that that can be privately enforced, that misbranding is something strictly for EPA to deal with, that the statute has a prohibition on misbranding? I can see the argument that all we're doing is enforcing the provision that says no misbranding. So is EPA the only the player in the misbranding --
03-388 +++$+++ 6324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Insofar as labeling is concerned, the answer is yes, and that's because the statute -- the statute has many, many instances in which it makes it clear that in service of the objective of a nationally uniform label, the expert agency that approves and dictates the language of that label be the one to decide what is or isn't --
03-388 +++$+++ 6325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman --
03-388 +++$+++ 6326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where does it say that?
03-388 +++$+++ 6327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- can I ask you one question here?
03-388 +++$+++ 6328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because you were just going to point out where it says that --
03-388 +++$+++ 6329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It goes to your --
03-388 +++$+++ 6330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- which I think is --
03-388 +++$+++ 6331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Excuse me.
03-388 +++$+++ 6332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry.
03-388 +++$+++ 6333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Just let me ask this one question. Supposing the label says, this product contains vitamin A. Period. And it doesn't contain vitamin A, and they prove that in court. And you say you would have to change the label. I suggest you could change the product by putting vitamin A in it.
03-388 +++$+++ 6334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you can -- you're --
03-388 +++$+++ 6335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why isn't that an answer to the misbranding? You change the product not necessarily the label.
03-388 +++$+++ 6336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because the difference between a -- that would be a -- a manufacturing defect, which are cases that have been decided --
03-388 +++$+++ 6337 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It would be a false statement in the label. The label happened to be false, a misrepresentation in it.
03-388 +++$+++ 6338 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if the -- if it contains -- I'm sorry. Was it vitamin A? If it contains vitamin A because that's what the manufacturer intended and that's what the manufacturer produced --
03-388 +++$+++ 6339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. The manufacturer knew it didn't contain it. He falsely put that in the statement --
03-388 +++$+++ 6340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, I see. Said that --
03-388 +++$+++ 6341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and -- and it's -- it's a misbranded, false statement. Now, does he have to change the label or could he change the product?
03-388 +++$+++ 6342 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I believe that you have -- you would have to -- I mean, would it be efficacious with vitamin A? I don't know, but if it -- if it requires a change in the label, it has to be done by EPA because the manufacturer commits a Federal law violation if it sells the product with any different label. If you -- if I can just direct the Court's attention to --
03-388 +++$+++ 6343 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but I'm suggesting he could sell the product with the same label if he just changed the product to correct the misstatement.
03-388 +++$+++ 6344 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the test, as the Fifth Circuit stated, Justice Stevens, is whether a judgment against Dow -- I'm quoting. Quote: whether a judgment against Dow would cause it to need to alter the Strongarm label. I'm -- and that's the -- those are -- that's the test that was applied here and is always applied.
03-388 +++$+++ 6345 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay, but why --
03-388 +++$+++ 6346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is, does the State law cause of action -- is it premised on a State law duty that there -- that different labeling be used --
03-388 +++$+++ 6347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but neither --
03-388 +++$+++ 6348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that is, a little bit different than what Federal law requires.
03-388 +++$+++ 6349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The problem that I think some of -- several of us are having is that both the -- as I understand it, the Fifth Circuit test in your argument draws no distinction between the two following kinds of situations. Situation A: there's something that the manufacturer should have told you, should have put on the label, but the manufacturer didn't. Situation B: the manufacturer puts something on the label which in fact is wrong and in Justice Stevens' example is in fact false and it causes harm. It makes sense, it seems to me, for preemption purposes to say if the person who sues sues simply on the ground that I bought it in reliance on the label, the label was false, I should get damages for -- for whatever harm was caused, that situation should be dealt with for preemption purposes differently from the situation in which the -- the manufacturer made no false statement. He simply should have said more. And if -- if you don't distinguish between those two situations, then the -- the prohibition against mislabeling means absolutely nothing because -- because it can never be enforced, in effect, except with respect to some prospective user. It can never be enforced with respect to the actual user.
03-388 +++$+++ 6350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, that is a choice that Congress could have made. It is plainly not a choice that Congress did make because it applied the preemption provision to requirements that are either in addition to or different than. And whether a label is assertedly misleading because it fails to include something on the EPA-approved label or --
03-388 +++$+++ 6351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Requirements for labeling or packaging --
03-388 +++$+++ 6352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-388 +++$+++ 6353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that are in addition to or different.
03-388 +++$+++ 6354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I -- I --
03-388 +++$+++ 6355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Requirements for labeling or packaging.
03-388 +++$+++ 6356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, and -- and if it -- if the --
03-388 +++$+++ 6357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, and the argument that's being made is that we ought to -- we ought to read -- we ought to read the limitation, which Justice Scalia has just described, with respect to labeling and packaging, in a relatively narrow way to allow the suit to go forward and, therefore, we ought to make a distinction between the two kinds of situations.
03-388 +++$+++ 6358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The allegation in this suit -- the claims in this suit -- and I -- I see that my time has expired.
03-388 +++$+++ 6359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ms. Blatt.
03-388 +++$+++ 6361 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: It would entirely destroy the uniformity contemplated by -- contemplated by the statute if the EPA-approved and mandated label were subject to jury-by-jury invalidation based on a jury's determination of whether a label is false.
03-388 +++$+++ 6362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is a new position for the Government, isn't it?
03-388 +++$+++ 6363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, we have --
03-388 +++$+++ 6364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You used to take the opposite position.
03-388 +++$+++ 6365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right.
03-388 +++$+++ 6366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And we're dealing here, as -- nobody has mentioned it, but there -- there's a clear statement rule for preemption, isn't there? Doesn't the preemption of -- of traditional State powers have to be clear in the statute?
03-388 +++$+++ 6367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We -- we think subsection (b) is unambiguous in preempting any statement.
03-388 +++$+++ 6368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's -- it's ambiguous enough that the Government -- the -- the chief beneficiary of the -- of the supposed preemption didn't see it. It used to come out the other way. How can you possibly say it's clear?
03-388 +++$+++ 6369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the agency is allowed to change its position and we realize --
03-388 +++$+++ 6370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understand. It's -- it's welcome to change it, but it -- it's one thing to change it. It's another thing to change it and come in to say that the question is clear.
03-388 +++$+++ 6371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we think that -- we realize that our position was inconsistent with not only the Court's decision in Cipollone and in Medtronic that recognizes that requirement extends to common law duties. But more importantly, a system where a jury-by-jury on the same facts could come up with completely different reasons why a label is false --
03-388 +++$+++ 6372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So -- so if you have one administration thinking the one thing and the other thinking the other thing, why isn't the answer that the agency can promulgate the reg it wants? And therefore if the reg -- if the agency comes to that conclusion, let them promulgate that reg. And if a different one thinks it can work with the tort suits, let them promulgate that reg.
03-388 +++$+++ 6373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, unlike Medtronic where preemption occurred by virtue of the FDA's regulation, under FIFRA there's preemption by virtue of the statute itself. And I just want to give one --
03-388 +++$+++ 6374 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but why isn't there a big difference, for purposes of your argument, between the Medtronic situation and this one for the simple reason in this case you've got a statute that authorizes EPA to do absolutely nothing on the subject of efficacy? And EPA does nothing on the subject of efficacy.
03-388 +++$+++ 6375 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's just not true, with all due respect. I mean, they -- the -- we don't verify the accuracy of the efficacy labeling, but the requirement, both in the preemption provision and in the requirement to use the EPA label, clearly extends to efficacy. And you can have disuniform context whether it's safety or efficacy. Imagine a label that directs a product to be mixed for 20 minutes. One jury could find the label was false because the product should have only been mixed for 10 minutes. Another jury in the same courthouse could find the label was false because the product should have been mixed for at least 30 minutes. And this case is another really good example. Now the petitioners are saying the label says that the soil only should be a 7.2 level. Their expert says --
03-388 +++$+++ 6376 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but the remedy to that would not necessarily be to change the label. It might be to change the quality of the product that requires how much time for mixing.
03-388 +++$+++ 6377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And we think it's critical that our position is that this statute only operates in the area of labeling, and it preempts only those State labeling requirements --
03-388 +++$+++ 6378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What do you say about my vitamin A example?
03-388 +++$+++ 6379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think your vitamin A example is an excellent example of a non-preempted claim. If a manufacturer says that this is a pesticide and he puts Clorox in the bottle, the plaintiff wants to get to the jury on the theory that a reasonable manufacturer would not have used Clorox. He would have used the pesticide. If the argument, on the other hand, is Clorox was fine. I don't have a problem with Clorox, I just wish I would have been given a warning, but that's not the way a plaintiff would frame his complaint. We think it's critical that our theory is if the plaintiff's theory of recovery is necessarily -- necessarily predicated on a requirement that the manufacturer used a label different than the EPA-approved label the Federal law required it use --
03-388 +++$+++ 6380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let's -- let's be specific here. If it's a failure to test, if it's a -- a design defect requirement, if it's an off-labeled, false misrepresentation, why are they preempted?
03-388 +++$+++ 6381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ On the face of the complaint, we agree that they're not preempted. Our only position is by the time it got to summary judgment, the courts decided that they had no evidence on what would have been non-preempted claims. If another farmer wants to bring an expert that says Strongarm can be manufactured --
03-388 +++$+++ 6382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But then do you endorse the theory of the Court of Appeals in this case?
03-388 +++$+++ 6383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we think the Court of Appeals took it claim by claim and read the affidavit -- or at least the District Court did --
03-388 +++$+++ 6384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you think just mere inducement to change a label is sufficient to create preemption.
03-388 +++$+++ 6385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mere inducement only to the extent that that's a shorthand way of saying the label was -- necessarily had to be required. Let me give you an example.
03-388 +++$+++ 6386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If Congress wanted that, surely it could have stated it more clearly than simply saying the State shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging. A tort suit because of -- of mislabeling is not a requirement for labeling or packaging.
03-388 +++$+++ 6387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the --
03-388 +++$+++ 6388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if Congress wanted to say that, they could have said it.
03-388 +++$+++ 6389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think they did say if a common law duty is necessarily premised on the requirement that the manufacturer used a different label than Federal law required him to use. In this case, the common law duty of a failure to warn is saying the manufacturer should have put something on --
03-388 +++$+++ 6390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You have -- you have that provision which talks about requirements for labeling or packaging in conjunction with another provision that authorizes the State to regulate the sale or use.
03-388 +++$+++ 6391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The --
03-388 +++$+++ 6392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, you -- you have to make sense of the two.
03-388 +++$+++ 6393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, and that's --
03-388 +++$+++ 6394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it seems to me that means the State can impose certain requirements upon the seller to the consumer --
03-388 +++$+++ 6395 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not on labeling. Justice Scalia, every day --
03-388 +++$+++ 6396 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, every change -- virtually every change -- virtually everyone -- if -- if you believe the respondent's theory, virtually any State regulation of the substance of the sale will require a change in the label.
03-388 +++$+++ 6397 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's just not true. Every day States and localities around the country are imposing use restrictions. They tell -- they tell applicators and users when and where to apply the pesticide and what types of --
03-388 +++$+++ 6398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sale -- sale or use is what it says.
03-388 +++$+++ 6399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right and they --
03-388 +++$+++ 6400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Say -- if they regulate the sale or use.
03-388 +++$+++ 6401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right, and they do that every day without imposing labeling requirements. Imagine -- imagine --
03-388 +++$+++ 6402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Give me sale examples.
03-388 +++$+++ 6403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They require the manufacturer, in order to sell the product, be registered with the State, and they can impose whatever sale restrictions they want --
03-388 +++$+++ 6404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And can they --
03-388 +++$+++ 6405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that don't go to the labeling.
03-388 +++$+++ 6406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can they do the same thing by -- through jury verdicts?
03-388 +++$+++ 6407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely not. It would be bad enough if a manufacturer had to shop his label around 50 States and had each --
03-388 +++$+++ 6408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So now -- so now you say a State can do something by regulation that a jury can't do.
03-388 +++$+++ 6409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. A State absolutely cannot impose labeling restrictions on a manufacturer.
03-388 +++$+++ 6410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm asking if the -- if juries can do anything that the -- are -- are prohibited under your view from doing anything that the State could do by a State regulation.
03-388 +++$+++ 6411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. I'm sorry. Right. Under -- it -- the alternative theory would give more power to the jury to impose labeling restrictions than the State, and we don't think the State can do it. And it would be far more pernicious if a label were subject to jury-by-jury invalidation. No one would read the label, much less understand it.
03-388 +++$+++ 6412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ms. Blatt, there's a brief in this case -- there's a brief in this case that just shows hundreds, if not thousands, of crop damage claims. And your theory is that with this ambiguous provision Congress wiped all that out. It's hard to believe.
03-388 +++$+++ 6413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. Congress just wiped out labeling and only those labeling requirements --
03-388 +++$+++ 6414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But everything becomes -- but every -- every time -- my crop was stunted. Okay. You have to change the label so you can't bring that suit.
03-388 +++$+++ 6415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, it's just not true. The lower courts well understand this distinction, and they -- they let go all the time claims as not preempted that are true manufacturing defect or true design defect claims. This is not a complete immunity. This is a narrowly targeted one as to labeling. There is a famous example of the Benlate --
03-388 +++$+++ 6416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He says their claim is -- is very simple. You didn't tell us that using this in our kind of soil would stunt the crop and wouldn't kill the weeds.
03-388 +++$+++ 6417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
03-388 +++$+++ 6418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you're saying that kind of claim can't be brought anymore.
03-388 +++$+++ 6419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It can be brought if there's State law and evidence to support the State law that doesn't attack the labeling. And our --
03-388 +++$+++ 6420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I've described a set of facts which your position I think you have to say affects the label. The -- the farmer says I bought this bottle. It said okay for all peanuts. My crop grew and it was stunted and the weeds stayed alive.
03-388 +++$+++ 6421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If they found an expert that said if you had manufactured this differently or if you had designed it differently and there was evidence to support that, our view is that those claims aren't preempted. And the alternative to let juries --
03-388 +++$+++ 6422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I'm not giving you that case. I'm giving you exactly what happened.
03-388 +++$+++ 6423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This case -- they didn't have any evidence other than saying that the label was inaccurate. But the next -- another jury could rely on the respondent's evidence to say the label was inaccurate because it works better on high pH soil, and another jury could say, well, we need a margin of safety and the label should have said 6.8 instead of 7.0, which is what their expert says. And you can have this time and time again with how often the pesticide has to be applied, when it has to be applied. And to -- and the -- the whole point of section 136v(b) was to have reliability --
03-388 +++$+++ 6424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was that happening when EPA took the opposite view? Was there this tremendous disparity with juries going every which way --
03-388 +++$+++ 6425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there's -- there's been preemption at least since the late '80's, and I don't know of cases where juries -- or the theory for recovery was invalidating the label. There are lots of cases that are true manufacturing defect claims, and I direct your attention to the Benlate where the manufacturer contaminated his product. If I'm the plaintiff, my theory -- the theory was you mismanufactured this product. A reasonable manufacturer would have taken practices to prevent contamination, and it destroyed a lot of crops and EPA actually took enforcement action against that manufacturer. The rat poisoning example -- a 9-year-old kid died of rat poisoning because it tasted like a candy bar. The theory of recovery was all the manufacturer had to do was put a bittering agent in it that would have made the kid throw up and the rats still would have loved the poisoning. That has nothing to do with the label.
03-388 +++$+++ 6426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Ms. Blatt. You have about 4 minutes.
03-388 +++$+++ 6428 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I just have two points to make. With respect to the summary judgment posture of the case, the way this unfolded was that on one day the District Court decided the motion for jurisdiction, that it had jurisdiction. On the very next day, Dow rushed into court with its motion for summary judgment. And what Mr. Waxman cites as the Celotex invocation merely says that on -- on this point it is neither unfair nor premature to require defendants to produce evidence in support of their claims now as the Celotex trilogy requires. I'm reading from their motion for summary judgment. That was filed before the counterclaims. The only thing that they knew about was the deceptive trade practices notice letter that the farmers had filed pursuant to State law. So they didn't know what our claims were, and they were requiring or saying that the District Court could throw us out of court without giving us any opportunity to file counterclaims, much less try to develop evidence that would prove them. Now, with respect to the disuniformity point, when Congress amended the statute in 1988 to add the word uniformity, it said in that public law that it was a technical amendment. We don't know why Congress put the word uniformity in. The legislative history is barren. It just says this is a technical amendment. It didn't change the substantive provisions that empowered States to impose regulations that would have the effect of disuniformity. Now, at the end of the day, we've got claims that have been brought historically since the late 19th century. Until EPA had a sudden change of heart, there were decades in which juries made these decisions with respect to these kinds of products, and those preemption decisions really didn't take hold until after this Court announced Cipollone in 1992. And it was only at that point that the courts began to have preemption, but for the previous 2 decades, juries routinely decided these kinds of cases. The sky did not fall. EPA didn't come in and say there's labeling disuniformity as a result of this. There simply were no problems. But what did happen was that the farmers who used products were able to get compensation when pesticides damaged their crops. Thank you.
03-388 +++$+++ 6429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The case is submitted.
03-407 +++$+++ 6433 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in No. 03-407, John F. Kowalski v. John C. Tesmer. Mr. Casey.
03-407 +++$+++ 6435 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this facial challenge to the Michigan statute, court of appeals rulings that these lawyers have third party standing and that their potential clients have a constitutional right to appointed counsel in discretionary appeals are both wrong. First, with respect to the standing argument, in our brief we argue that the respondent attorneys could not meet any of the criteria for standing. This morning I'd like to focus on the element of prudential standing that considers whether there is a hindrance to the ability of a third party to protect his own -- to protect his own interest.
03-407 +++$+++ 6436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- there is an injury in fact. These lawyers claim that if the State were compensating for this service and they're on the list to be appointed, they would have more money in their pockets. You're not -- you're not challenging that there is an injury in fact.
03-407 +++$+++ 6437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. In our -- in our brief we have challenged that. The -- the requirement is that there be an injury in fact, a concrete and particularized actual or imminent injury in fact.
03-407 +++$+++ 6438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you -- you said now you were going on to the prudential factors, and so I asked were you recognizing that there was an injury in fact, and you said no. And -- and why not? Because it seems so obvious that they would get appointments if the system were --
03-407 +++$+++ 6439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I take it you're reserving it for -- in your -- in your brief.
03-407 +++$+++ 6440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I am not waiving the argument. I -- I would like to rest on the brief. But I -- in answer to your question, we believe yes, there is a likelihood that these lawyers on the list for appointed counsel will some day -- if they stay on the list and a case comes up in that county, there is a likelihood that there will be a case. We submit, however, that on these facts in this facial challenge, we don't know how many lawyers are on the list for appointments in Saginaw County. We don't know how many appeals of this nature come up. So it may be many years before the situation arises. This is not a concrete and particularized actual or imminent injury in fact, and we've argued that in the brief. At -- at best, if there is an injury in fact and if there is -- another factor is the close relationship to the third party. We believe those are weak at best, and we've argued in our brief that they don't exist. I think it is most clear, however, that the criteria concerning the hindrance to the third party does not exist here. This is a facial challenge bought by -- brought by lawyers before the statute took effect, claiming not that the statute violates their own constitutional rights, but that it violates the rights of potential future clients, and that the lawyers will suffer economic harm.
03-407 +++$+++ 6441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I clarify something about this case? Are any of the indigent defendants whose rights the respondent attorneys want to advance -- do any of those people themselves have standing to bring their claims in Federal court now?
03-407 +++$+++ 6442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. We argue that there are -- there are three ways that an indigent defendant can bring this claim themselves without having to rely on an attorney in this type of case. First, they can bring the challenge directly through the State courts.
03-407 +++$+++ 6443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm asking if there are any individuals now before this Court in this case --
03-407 +++$+++ 6444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. None of these -- none of these defendants --
03-407 +++$+++ 6445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- who would be available and who would have remedies or standing to bring their claims. Are we just talking pure hypotheticals here?
03-407 +++$+++ 6446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In this facial challenge, we're talking about pure hypotheticals. The -- the three named indigent defendants --
03-407 +++$+++ 6447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There were three named indigents.
03-407 +++$+++ 6448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct.
03-407 +++$+++ 6449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They were?
03-407 +++$+++ 6450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They were denied counsel.
03-407 +++$+++ 6451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Denied counsel, and they were also dismissed at some point down the line?
03-407 +++$+++ 6452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. The -- the Sixth Circuit held that the Federal court should abstain from deciding their claims because they could have brought their claims in their direct State appeals. They raised claims about the practice of denying counsel before the statute took effect.
03-407 +++$+++ 6453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Casey, was it a Younger abstention --
03-407 +++$+++ 6454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-407 +++$+++ 6455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- with respect to the --
03-407 +++$+++ 6456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the Sixth Circuit en banc held that under Younger v. Harris, the Federal court should abstain from deciding the claims of the three indigent defendants.
03-407 +++$+++ 6457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that means that the defendants could never bring this 1983 suit. Only the lawyers arguably could.
03-407 +++$+++ 6458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. Younger v. Harris is only -- only defers the time when a proper Federal civil rights action can be brought. There were -- at the time this action was brought, there were pending State appeals in two of the cases. One of the defendants never appealed at all. The Sixth Circuit recently issued an opinion not --
03-407 +++$+++ 6459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why didn't these lawyers instead of -- instead of trying to sue on their own, why didn't they just offer their services to -- to these defendants through the State courts?
03-407 +++$+++ 6460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, perhaps opposing counsel could answer that better than I. We say that is the --
03-407 +++$+++ 6461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, that's what I don't understand about -- about the fact that they won't -- won't have the right to counsel. It -- it's at least as easy for -- for counsel to appear in cases in which indigents need counsel as it is for counsel to bring their own lawsuit.
03-407 +++$+++ 6462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is our point on the standing issue precisely, Your Honor.
03-407 +++$+++ 6463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Didn't -- didn't the Michigan Supreme Court already rule on this issue and said that the statute was constitutional, that there was no right to counsel, therefore no possibility of appointing counsel, paid counsel?
03-407 +++$+++ 6464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. In -- in 2000, the -- the -- while this case was pending, the Michigan Supreme Court issued an opinion, the Bulger decision that's discussed in the briefs, saying that the practice of denying appointed counsel was constitutional. The statute was not in effect at that time. The statute took effect, and in a case just decided in June of this year, People v. Harris, the Michigan Supreme Court relied on Bulger and said this statute is constitutional. It does not violate any rights.
03-407 +++$+++ 6465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So going through the State system, there's no possibility that these lawyers or the defendants could successfully assert a right to paid counsel --
03-407 +++$+++ 6466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct.
03-407 +++$+++ 6467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- because that's already been decided by the Michigan Supreme Court.
03-407 +++$+++ 6468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As -- as a matter of jurisprudence by the State supreme court, yes. Both State and Federal constitutional --
03-407 +++$+++ 6469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There -- there's an appeal from -- they could request certiorari from the State supreme court to this Court, I assume.
03-407 +++$+++ 6470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There are, in fact, two cases pending, the Harris case that I just mentioned. A petition for certiorari was filed about 2 weeks ago raising this precise claim. There is another case Halbert v. Michigan. It's docket --
03-407 +++$+++ 6471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was there -- was there a cert petition in Bulger itself?
03-407 +++$+++ 6472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There was a petition in Bulger.
03-407 +++$+++ 6473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it was denied.
03-407 +++$+++ 6474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was denied. In -- in addition --
03-407 +++$+++ 6475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there -- there is a cert petition filed in what case? In the June case?
03-407 +++$+++ 6476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In the -- the case is pending in this Court as Melody Harris v. Michigan. It was filed about 2 weeks ago. I have not been able to find out the docket number. There was another case, Halbert v. Michigan, which is a pro se defendant who was denied counsel. His applications, pro se applications, were denied in the State appellate courts. A pro se petition was filed. I filed a response to that about a month ago. That's docket number 03-10198. It's on this Court's conference for Friday, October 8th.
03-407 +++$+++ 6477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So your point is that there are petitions filed here that would enable this Court to decide whether the Michigan Supreme Court was correct in holding the statute constitutional.
03-407 +++$+++ 6478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. There are at least those two petitions pending that I'm aware of in this Court now.
03-407 +++$+++ 6479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you acknowledge there is a good Federal question there at least?
03-407 +++$+++ 6480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes. It's -- it's an important question.
03-407 +++$+++ 6481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-407 +++$+++ 6482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- we -- in the Bulger case, I opposed certiorari, saying that yes, it's an important question, but it was correctly decided. At that time, there was no conflict. Then when the Sixth Circuit opinion came up, we filed the petition saying it's an important question and now there's a conflict between the State supreme court and the Federal court of appeals.
03-407 +++$+++ 6483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the position you've taken in -- in the Halbert case, that the Court should take the case?
03-407 +++$+++ 6484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What I said in the Halbert case is that the Court need not grant this petition now because, although it's an important question, the issue is pending in -- in this Tesmer, the current case, Kowalski v. Tesmer. If this Court rules in our favor on standing and then does not reach the constitutional question, then it would be appropriate to grant certiorari in either the Halbert case or the Harris case because the -- the determination of the constitutionality of this statute is important to the State of Michigan.
03-407 +++$+++ 6485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do they have lawyers in those cases?
03-407 +++$+++ 6486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, the Halbert petition is pro se. The Harris petition has either retained or pro bono counsel. But the -- the constitutionality of the statute is -- excuse me -- is directly challenged in both of those petitions.
03-407 +++$+++ 6487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask you if in exercising prudential judgment on whether to accord prudential standing, because I guess there's article III standing here, is it appropriate to take into consideration as one fact that it's already been argued in this case and it's now ripe for decision, or should we just totally ignore that aspect of the case?
03-407 +++$+++ 6488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As a matter of judicial economy, there is a point to be made that it -- the issue has been briefed and argued. So perhaps it should be decided. Just last term in Elk Grove v. Newdow, the Court faced a similar situation. They disposed of the case on standing --
03-407 +++$+++ 6489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but in that case there was a conflict between the interests of the third party and the interests of the litigant or a potential client. Here there's no conflict between the lawyers and the clients.
03-407 +++$+++ 6490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true. That's true.
03-407 +++$+++ 6491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, also bearing upon our prudential judgment, I -- I suppose, would be that in order to reach the merits, we have to do what you assert to be an end run around the Younger abstention. And --
03-407 +++$+++ 6492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's -- that's correct. In my view, the -- the most logical, most appropriate disposition would be to say that these attorneys do not have standing. Therefore, reverse the Sixth Circuit's judgment. There are these other vehicles pending now to reach the constitutional issue.
03-407 +++$+++ 6493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but why isn't the Younger abstention problem just like the mootness problem in Craig against Boren? It took one class of litigants unavailable but then allowed the third party to have standing. Why -- why aren't -- aren't your opponents here just like the bartenders in Craig against Boren?
03-407 +++$+++ 6494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in determining prudential standing, there are several criteria that should be examined in deciding whether there's an exception to the general rule where a litigant cannot argue the rights of third parties. In Craig v. Boren, the statute directly affected the vendor in that case. It was a statute against sale of certain alcoholic beverages. And in this case we don't have that. Also, in Craig v. Boren, nobody argued prudential standing considerations until the case reached the Supreme Court apparently. But in our case, we have a situation where we have lawyers who do not have any present clients who are not directly affected by the statute. They're not claiming rights --
03-407 +++$+++ 6495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but they have the same interest that the bartenders had because they won't make some -- sell their services and the bartenders wouldn't sell the booze. I don't see the difference.
03-407 +++$+++ 6496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in -- in Craig v. Boren, the -- if the bartenders did not comply with the statute, they'd be subject to criminal penalties. Here, the attorneys will not be subject to any criminal penalties.
03-407 +++$+++ 6506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the -- the claim that -- I'm sorry.
03-407 +++$+++ 6507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it just would seem to me that the lawyers who are advancing this claim may or may not be representing individuals who want to make the same claim, but there -- there must be some lawyers who want to make these claims who don't have any clients, and the question is whether they have standing. And are they to be defeated standing because there are a lot of other lawyers who might also sue?
03-407 +++$+++ 6508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In our view, as a general proposition, lawyers should not be given independent standing to raise claims of their clients. When the clients can present their own issues themselves, as they can in this case or in this situation under the statute, there's no need --
03-407 +++$+++ 6509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that different from Caplin & Drysdale where the lawyers didn't raise the interest of the client and --
03-407 +++$+++ 6510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Again, there was an actual client in that case and there was significant money at stake. The lawyers had been paid money from drug forfeiture. They had been paid $25,000, and they wanted another 107 --
03-407 +++$+++ 6511 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But as far as the actual client, you moved to dismiss. So that's why there's no -- was no back-development. You moved to dismiss. Therefore, you have to assume whatever facts --
03-407 +++$+++ 6512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that's correct.
03-407 +++$+++ 6513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in favor of the opponent of the motion.
03-407 +++$+++ 6514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. But my response on that was to the question of, you know, do they in fact now have clients. There is no allegation in the complaint and no proof that they now have clients. They may --
03-407 +++$+++ 6515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if -- if you assume -- you assume the correctness of the allegations, which you -- you have to do at this point, the allegation is that they would get clients and would be paid but for this bar to payment. Isn't that correct? So if you take them in terms of their claim, you've got to assume that they will have clients and they can bring this -- this issue on behalf of the client.
03-407 +++$+++ 6516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct. That goes to the criteria of injury in fact and close relationship with the third party. We still have the criteria that I wanted to discuss this morning about hindrance to the right -- to the ability of the third party to litigate for themselves. Excuse me. In our view, there is no need to expand the doctrine of standing to permit lawyers to have independent standing to make these claims because the clients, who are directly affected by the statute, can make them themselves. There are the two pending habeas -- or two pending petitions for certiorari that we've mentioned. There is another case, the Bulger case. Mr. Bulger himself, after he lost in the Michigan courts, he filed a petition for -- for habeas corpus. And the district court granted the writ of habeas corpus. We appealed. That case is now pending in the Sixth Circuit. So that's another vehicle. It is also possible that an indigent inmate himself could bring a section 1983 case. It's simply not necessary to expand the doctrine of standing to give lawyers --
03-407 +++$+++ 6517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How could an indigent bring a 1983 case? I thought you said that that would be barred by Younger.
03-407 +++$+++ 6518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If they had a pending prosecution, it would be barred by Younger. Once that pending prosecution is over, they could bring a 1983 action.
03-407 +++$+++ 6519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could they? Because I thought this Court had held that -- that you can't bring a 1983 suit if what you're seeking to do is overturn the conviction.
03-407 +++$+++ 6520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under Heck v. Humphrey, if the outcome of the 1983 case would necessarily imply that the conviction or sentence is invalid, you cannot bring the 1983 case. Here, the allegation is simply that they were entitled to counsel. That's not the substantive merits of whether the claim -- whether they are properly convicted or properly sentenced. The Sixth Circuit, in a case decided August 31st --
03-407 +++$+++ 6521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if that -- that -- that's -- you're saying that the defendants themselves could not sue now under 1983?
03-407 +++$+++ 6522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A -- a defendant who is currently in the State system on direct appeal is barred by the abstention doctrine from filing a 1983 action. But after they go through the State court and lose, in addition to filing a writ of certiorari with this Court --
03-407 +++$+++ 6523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And presumably up to this Court, if they want to come that far.
03-407 +++$+++ 6524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, certainly. After -- after they go through the State court, they could file a writ of cert in this Court, as the two pending petitions have. They could file a complaint for habeas corpus. They could bring a facial challenge under 1983. In a case called Howard v. Whitbeck from the Sixth Circuit, just decided about a month ago, that was the very question that was decided. An inmate -- a prison inmate, challenging another statute, litigated and lost in the State court, then filed a 1983 action. We argued in a Federal case under Rooker v. Feldman, he was actually trying to seek review of the State court judgment. The district court agreed. But the Sixth Circuit just said Rooker v. Feldman bars the as-applied challenge, but they remanded for a trial on the merits of the facial challenge, which is not barred by Rooker v. Feldman. So an inmate who has been unsuccessful in the State court, under Sixth Circuit law in my jurisdiction, can bring a 1983 action. So there are at least three vehicles that an inmate can bring --
03-407 +++$+++ 6525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And do you -- do you agree that that's right? And you said that that's their theory, that they could bring a 1983 action.
03-407 +++$+++ 6526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We are not filing a petition for certiorari from that decision. We are abiding by that decision. We're going back and we're going to try that case on the merits of the facial challenge to the statute. That -- that case is Howard v. Whitbeck, docket number 03-1396.
03-407 +++$+++ 6527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, what the other side says is, well, yes, maybe they can bring these suits, but in all of those suits, they don't have counsel, what they -- what they --
03-407 +++$+++ 6528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true. That -- that gets into the -- the merits of the constitutional claim. And in our view, talking about the merits, all that is required in the Michigan application for leave to appeal process is that a defendant identify the issues and ask the appellate court to review it. Unlike Douglas, this is not a review on the merits. An order denying an application for leave is not an affirmance. It's not an adjudication of the merits of any legal issue.
03-407 +++$+++ 6529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what do we look to in order to verify what -- what you've just said? Do the Michigan appellate courts catch mistakes all the time? And if so, what's the standard that they use?
03-407 +++$+++ 6530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The court rules concerning applications for leave do not set out specific standards. What -- what the court of appeals can do on an application for leave is grant the application, deny it, or issue peremptory relief.
03-407 +++$+++ 6531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what are the standards they use? Where -- where do I look to find out what standards they use, if I get there?
03-407 +++$+++ 6532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To the best of my knowledge, there are no published standards in court rule or statute on that. The court is free to exercise its discretion to -- to deny leave for any reason that it chooses.
03-407 +++$+++ 6533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can you give me an example of where they grant leave to appeal, and if not -- and it's not one of the exceptions listed in the statute such as incorrect --
03-407 +++$+++ 6534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If -- if --
03-407 +++$+++ 6535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- such as incorrect sentencing?
03-407 +++$+++ 6536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if -- under the statute, if the court of appeals grants leave, counsel is automatically appointed.
03-407 +++$+++ 6537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. What are the instances in which they grant leave, other than sentencing or some other statutory --
03-407 +++$+++ 6538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They're -- most often they are sentencing issues. The statistics we put in our brief, in footnote 25 of our brief, indicated that out of the -- in 2001, there were 38,000 guilty plea convictions. The court of appeals that year disposed of 7,600 cases. 14 percent of them were guilty plea appeals. Most of them were disposed of by order. There were somewhere in the neighborhood of about 50 decisions -- opinions issued in guilty plea cases. I have not canvased all of them. I suspect that the vast majority of them are sentencing issues.
03-407 +++$+++ 6539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do we -- do we know whether any of those were cases that didn't fall under the four categories where you a -- a right to?
03-407 +++$+++ 6540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In every case where there was an opinion, counsel was appointed. The statute requires it.
03-407 +++$+++ 6541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But one of the problems, I thought, for the indigent is the rulings -- am I correct -- in Michigan, that they're not required -- say, there's an objection. There's no written record that the indigent could look to, even assuming he could understand it, to -- to determine what issues might be raised on -- on appeal.
03-407 +++$+++ 6542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe you're incorrect on that, Your Honor. The -- what an indigent inmate will -- or defendant will have available to him to prepare an application for leave to appeal is a transcript of the proceedings. He's entitled to that for free. He will have whatever written motions and written decisions the trial judge may have issued. He will have -- in the transcript, he will have the oral motions and the decisions of the judge, and then in addition to whatever pro se materials, as in the Ross v. Moffitt case, the inmate can muster. In -- in these cases, there are other pro se materials available. The district court's opinion in this case noted that there is a -- a form brief, 38-page brief that was circulating among inmates on the precise question of entitlement to counsel, which two of the defendants used in their State court appeals. But in determining whether counsel is constitutionally required under Ross v. Moffitt, this Court has said you look to two things. Are the merits decided? What is the nature of the appellate process? And if the merits are not being decided, as in the Michigan case, we say that falls within the Ross v. Moffitt line of cases, unlike the Douglas case. In -- in addition to the nature of the appellate proceedings, he --
03-407 +++$+++ 6543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, now, your -- your opponents quote some language from the -- one of the Michigan court of appeals which suggests that the reason that an appeal was denied was it had no merit.
03-407 +++$+++ 6544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A -- a typical order that the court of appeals issues when it denies an application for leave to appeal says, denied for lack of merit on the grounds presented. But there is published, controlling Michigan authority, which we cited in our brief, that says that language does not mean that the court of appeals looked at the merits of the underlying legal issue. What -- what the court is looking at is the question of whether to grant leave or deny leave. If they grant leave, counsel will be appointed. In a very real sense --
03-407 +++$+++ 6545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what are they getting at when they say merit? I mean, I take it you concede there was a quotation from that Contineri case on -- cited on page 30 of their brief. I mean, what -- what is the reference to merit supposed to mean?
03-407 +++$+++ 6546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I do not know why the court of appeals uses that language. What I do know is that the --
03-407 +++$+++ 6547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't the reasonable thing to assume that they use it as we would normally expect it to --
03-407 +++$+++ 6548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the --
03-407 +++$+++ 6549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- to mean by the words they use?
03-407 +++$+++ 6550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ On its face, that would be the first impression that is given from those words. However, the published opinions of the court of appeals we've cited in our brief reject that, and they say that in an application for leave to appeal, the court of appeals is not adjudicating the merits. My opposing counsel in this case was counsel of record in the Bulger case in the Michigan Supreme Court. He made exactly that same argument. He persuaded the dissent in that opinion, but he did not persuade the majority. They didn't decide the issue precisely, but he has been arguing that ever since. But the -- all the precedent that Michigan has on that point we've cited in our brief. Those are not decisions on the merits.
03-407 +++$+++ 6551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it true that Michigan is the only State in the Union so far that denies counsel on a first appeal, whether discretionary or mandatory?
03-407 +++$+++ 6552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe that is incorrect. The plaintiffs have cited a 1987 habeas corpus case that purports to make a national survey. In the Michigan v. Bulger Michigan Supreme Court opinion in footnote 3, they cited a 1992 Arizona study which reached almost an opposite conclusion. They said there were only seven States which give unrestricted right of appeal, and there were 21 States that prohibited appeals --
03-407 +++$+++ 6553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not -- not the right of appeal. The right to counsel, whether it's a mandatory or --
03-407 +++$+++ 6554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's my understanding that Michigan may be the only State that has a specific statute prohibiting it with exceptions like this, but it's also my understanding that the practice in many other States is that counsel is routinely denied in appeals from guilty pleas. I'd like to reserve my remaining time.
03-407 +++$+++ 6555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Very well, Mr. Casey. Mr. Moran, we'll hear from you.
03-407 +++$+++ 6557 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In fact, in the 41 years since this Court's decision in Douglas, no State, not one, not even a -- a territorial jurisdiction, except for Michigan, has even attempted to deny counsel to any indigents appealing any type of first tier appeal.
03-407 +++$+++ 6558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Mr. Moran, this is a very important question, whether the Michigan law can survive. But I think before we can address that, we have to decide whether there is standing for the lawyers you represent here today, and that's a much tougher question I think. Is it possible that this Court could grant certiorari in one of the pending petitions and resolve the underlying issue of constitutionality of Michigan's unusual law?
03-407 +++$+++ 6559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is, of course, possible, Justice O'Connor, that this Court could do that.
03-407 +++$+++ 6560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if we were to grant you standing here, wouldn't we have sort of expanded our existing holdings on who has standing?
03-407 +++$+++ 6561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not at all, Justice O'Connor. This case fits squarely within the two prior lawyer-client standing cases, the Triplett case in which this Court unanimously found standing for a -- for a lawyer representing black lung claimants, and the Caplin &Drysdale case in which this Court found standing for a third party assertion by a firm representing a criminal defendant. And what those three cases have in common and what makes them unique is that this can only arise in a case in which the statute or law being challenged disentitles the client either through loss of funding or through, like Michigan's law, a statute -- disentitles the client to representation. Any other change in the law, tort reform brought up by my --
03-407 +++$+++ 6562 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it doesn't really disentitle the client to representation. It says counsel won't be appointed for him. But presumably these lawyers could have offered their services.
03-407 +++$+++ 6563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, that wouldn't be practical, and that raises a point that Justice Souter also raised in the argument. It wouldn't be practical for Mr. Fitzgerald or Mr. Vogler to offer their services pro bono to some indigent in this position because to do so would probably -- probably be unethical or malpractice. First of all, they can't be appointed. What the statute prohibits is the appointment of counsel like Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler. So they -- they cannot form an attorney-client relationship by operation of law.
03-407 +++$+++ 6564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But isn't the answer that all they have to do is to say, okay, I will represent him but I am representing him with a claim for funds? And at the end of the day, regardless of what the Michigan law says, I'm going to say to the State of Michigan, through the court, pay me for what I did. That isn't a waiver and there's nothing unethical about it.
03-407 +++$+++ 6565 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But Justice Souter, that's impractical and unethical in this case because if Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler were to do that, they would have to represent the indigent on his or her underlying plea and sentencing issues --
03-407 +++$+++ 6566 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
03-407 +++$+++ 6567 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- or those would be lost forever --
03-407 +++$+++ 6568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-407 +++$+++ 6569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- because the time would fly. And so if they also represented him on the underlying plea and sentencing issues, then this person would not -- then the underlying defendant would not be a person with standing to raise the lack of counsel because in fact they have counsel.
03-407 +++$+++ 6570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, which -- which indigent defendants are the attorney plaintiffs asserting claims on behalf of here? Is it past defendants?
03-407 +++$+++ 6571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This was -- this was -- for Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler, they were challenging both the prestatutory practice of the three defendant judges.
03-407 +++$+++ 6572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're talking about the two individuals, but they've been dismissed.
03-407 +++$+++ 6573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler, Justice O'Connor, are the attorneys. They were -- they --
03-407 +++$+++ 6574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm trying to find out what indigent criminal defendants are these attorneys attempting to represent here.
03-407 +++$+++ 6575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They routinely take appointments. They are on a list of --
03-407 +++$+++ 6576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Future defendants?
03-407 +++$+++ 6577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Presently and future defendants.
03-407 +++$+++ 6578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Past defendants?
03-407 +++$+++ 6579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Past defendants. They -- they --
03-407 +++$+++ 6580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if it's past defendants who were convicted and didn't have counsel, how is it consistent with Heck v. Humphrey that they could be here, these attorneys?
03-407 +++$+++ 6581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think I -- I think I misspoke. At the time the statute was passed, it had not gone into effect. This challenge was filed in order to prevent the statute from going into effect, to prevent approximately 2,000 Michigan indigents a year being denied the right to counsel.
03-407 +++$+++ 6582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, are you asserting then that these attorney respondents are here trying to represent future defendants?
03-407 +++$+++ 6583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Present and future defendants.
03-407 +++$+++ 6584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if it's present defendants, how is that consistent with Younger? How can they do that?
03-407 +++$+++ 6585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they're not representing any named defendants. The -- the problem is that as the statute goes into effect, they will presumably not receive any further funding for --
03-407 +++$+++ 6586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if it's future people, how is it consistent with Los Angeles v. Lyons? I mean, I just don't see how these attorney representatives get here.
03-407 +++$+++ 6587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they're in exactly the same position as the bartender in -- or the beer vendor in -- in Craig v. Boren. They're representing prospective clients, prospective patients as in Singleton v. Wulff again. This Court has over and over again -- in fact, in Triplett itself, this Court recognized that -- specifically said that in Triplett that it applied to prospective clients, that the -- and it said that in Triplett that -- it quoted the three factors. And it said that -- excuse me. I'm looking at the wrong page. It said in Triplett that a restriction upon the fees a lawyer may charge applied to the lawyer's prospective client of a due process right to obtain legal representation falls squarely within this principle. And that was the principle of third party standing that this Court cited --
03-407 +++$+++ 6588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, of course, in Triplett, the attorneys themselves were subject to discipline. They were raising third party rights in order to defend a proceeding brought against themselves. It seems to me that's distinguishable.
03-407 +++$+++ 6589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's --
03-407 +++$+++ 6590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the same thing in the bar case. The -- the restriction against the sale of -- of liquor was a restriction imposed upon the person seeking to raise the third party right. But here, there's no restriction that applies to these lawyers who are seeking to raise the third party right.
03-407 +++$+++ 6591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But Justice Scalia, this Court has never held that such a restriction is a condition precedent or required in order for a person to assert third party rights.
03-407 +++$+++ 6592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's so, but we've never held what you want us to hold either, that -- that when the law does not bear upon you personally, you have the right to raise the claim of a prospective client. We've never held that either.
03-407 +++$+++ 6593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, in -- Singleton is a case in which there was no direct sanction against the doctors who provided Medicaid abortions.
03-407 +++$+++ 6594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, just as -- as to Triplett and Boren, you can't cite those two cases and say those are controlling and then say, well, we've never held it.
03-407 +++$+++ 6595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. I didn't follow that question, Justice Kennedy.
03-407 +++$+++ 6596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we've said that Triplett and -- and Boren are -- are distinguishable, and you said, well, we've never ruled on this point. Well, then Triplett and Boren aren't controlling.
03-407 +++$+++ 6597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think you have ruled on this Court -- point by many times recognizing that even persons against whom the statute or law would not directly affect -- for example, all the way back to 1925 with Pierce v. Society of Sisters, there was no legal prohibition against the school. The legal prohibition was against the students not going to public school. So 80 years ago this Court recognized that. In a situation analogous to this, the school --
03-407 +++$+++ 6598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was -- a prohibition was on the parents and there were no parents as plaintiffs in that case --
03-407 +++$+++ 6599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right.
03-407 +++$+++ 6600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- only the schools.
03-407 +++$+++ 6601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. It was the school that was -- was held to have standing to assert the rights of future and current students, and the same is true of the Singleton case where, again, there was no particular restriction against the doctors. It was simply that they would not get funding.
03-407 +++$+++ 6602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there was a problem, wasn't there, in Singleton that -- that the part that said that the doctors could raise the patients' right as opposed to the doctor's own right to practice or whatever, that that was only a plurality?
03-407 +++$+++ 6603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That was a plurality portion of the opinion.
03-407 +++$+++ 6604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it shouldn't be cited then. You're citing it for something that the Court didn't hold.
03-407 +++$+++ 6605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, actually we've cited it in our brief only for the article III proposition which this Court unanimously agreed that the doctors had article III standing because there was an economic energy --
03-407 +++$+++ 6606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- I thought you were citing it here for the quite different proposition that -- that you can raise third party rights.
03-407 +++$+++ 6607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But ultimately this Court in Singleton allowed the doctors' claim on behalf of the patients to proceed. I understand that it was a plurality opinion on the -- on the jus tertii standing.
03-407 +++$+++ 6608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I could accept -- I guess I probably would accept your position if I did not think there -- there was another equally workable alternative here. And I didn't understand your answer to my earlier question in which you said, if I recall correctly, that it would be unethical for these lawyers to represent a -- a future client, subject to a claim to be paid and on behalf both of the client and, I suppose, of themselves, but essentially on behalf of a client, say, there is a right to State money to pay the lawyer who is representing them. It would be, as I understood you to say, unethical for the lawyer to proceed on that basis. And I don't understand the reason for your answer.
03-407 +++$+++ 6609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think I might have misunderstood your question, Justice Souter. The question I understood was why don't they represent people and raise only the entitlement to right to counsel. In the Bulger case, for example, the Michigan Supreme Court --
03-407 +++$+++ 6624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's all you've got to get up here.
03-407 +++$+++ 6625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's at least an argument.
03-407 +++$+++ 6626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's an argument.
03-407 +++$+++ 6627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And even if they lose on it, they still will have -- would have raised the issue that you are most concerned about getting raised. They're not -- they're not so much interested in the so many dollars for this particular representation. Even if they lose on what seems to me at least a close argument, they will have raised the question you're trying to raise today.
03-407 +++$+++ 6628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And they will have to do so without any prospect of being paid, and that's -- that's the problem.
03-407 +++$+++ 6629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Who's paying them for this lawsuit?
03-407 +++$+++ 6630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're not being paid for this lawsuit.
03-407 +++$+++ 6631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. Exactly the same situation. They can -- they can bring the case directly for the client they're representing just as readily as they can bring this one. And if that is true, why is there an impediment to raising the issue unless we recognize third party standing?
03-407 +++$+++ 6632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because Justice Souter, they would have to represent them on all of their issues. They would have to represent them on their plea and sentencing issues without being paid. And that's not what they're doing in this --
03-407 +++$+++ 6633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Without being paid if they lose --
03-407 +++$+++ 6634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- in this litigation.
03-407 +++$+++ 6635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- being paid if they win. In this case, if they win, they don't get a dime because they're not representing a client. All they get is a declaration.
03-407 +++$+++ 6636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And --
03-407 +++$+++ 6637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And they'd be better off to represent a real client.
03-407 +++$+++ 6638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. They have a shot at getting paid using this other method.
03-407 +++$+++ 6639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In -- in this lawsuit, if we win on the merits, they will then get far more appointments on the rotation system and then they will get paid for those appointments.
03-407 +++$+++ 6640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why will they get more appointments?
03-407 +++$+++ 6641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because --
03-407 +++$+++ 6642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought you said there's a strict rotation system. When your name comes up, you get an appointment. How is that going to change regardless of how this comes out?
03-407 +++$+++ 6643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because the statute, which is now in effect -- and this goes, by the way, back to the issue of prudential standing --
03-407 +++$+++ 6644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, you're just saying there -- there's going to be a further class of clients to be represented on the rotation.
03-407 +++$+++ 6645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct. Far more.
03-407 +++$+++ 6646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay, but that's -- that's true.
03-407 +++$+++ 6647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and while this Court considers these issues of prudential standing, thousands of Michigan defendants will be denied the right to counsel --
03-407 +++$+++ 6648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And while this suit is being brought, we can't do the simple thing, which is to take a case from an indigent who's raising it that we happen to have on our docket and face it directly because everybody is tied up in these knots on standing. I mean, what -- what is it that -- that you -- led you to bring this case rather than just filing an amicus brief in a case brought by a real indigent who wants a lawyer?
03-407 +++$+++ 6649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because there -- there was no person in position at the time. The problem was we had to file this litigation before the statute went into effect because once the statute went into effect, thousands of Michigan indigents would be denied the right to counsel every year and would suffer probably irreparable damage to their right to appeal --
03-407 +++$+++ 6650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I see -- I see that. That's a good answer. And the -- the question I have is if I now, since we have real indigents, believe that there absolutely is a way for a real indigent to raise this claim that isn't even hard, you could file an amicus brief. Suppose I believed that, and I do believe it actually. If I believe it, then does your third party standing claim disappear?
03-407 +++$+++ 6651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
03-407 +++$+++ 6652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. Now, if it doesn't disappear and I hold in your favor, would I then be opening the door to any lawyer whose pocketbook is hurt by tort reform, by any change at all, you know, that means less money for him, and we'd be besieged with people? Instead of the clients, we'd have all the lawyers in complaining that they want to be richer. Now, that's what's worrying me. So on my assumption, how could I possibly decide in your favor without opening that door?
03-407 +++$+++ 6653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your --
03-407 +++$+++ 6654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's the question I'd like answered.
03-407 +++$+++ 6655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, the only kind of case to which this applies is a case exactly like Triplett, a case exactly like Caplin & Drysdale where the claim is that the underlying change in the law or the underlying law disenfranchises or disentitles the indigent or the criminal defendant or the defendant to representation.
03-407 +++$+++ 6656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because?
03-407 +++$+++ 6657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because, first of all, if the indigent or the client still has representation, then there is no hindrance to the third party raising it themselves.
03-407 +++$+++ 6658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is that? Why would a change in substantive law --
03-407 +++$+++ 6659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. I assumed there's --
03-407 +++$+++ 6660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- have the same result? Suppose there's a change in -- in the antitrust law and -- and the person says this change -- this change has the -- the effect of -- of denying me equal protection of the law. That's the claim that the -- that the client would have. But there's a lawyer who says, my goodness, this change will mean there are many -- many fewer antitrust suits. I can demonstrate that. That's my specialty, antitrust law. I'm going to lose a lot of business. Why wouldn't he have the right to raise the equal protection claim of the prospective client?
03-407 +++$+++ 6661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because the client could raise it directly, represented by the attorney. And so the third prong in jus tertii standing would be clearly missing in that case.
03-407 +++$+++ 6662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I'm sorry. I -- I -- Justice Scalia and I were assuming the same thing. If I assume that there's no problem with the real person, the indigent, raising the claim himself -- and I'm saying on that assumption, which I believe, then if I were to decide in your favor, how would I not be opening the door that I wanted to keep firmly closed?
03-407 +++$+++ 6663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But this Court's precedents indicate, Justice Breyer, that the indigents do have a significant hindrance to filing their claims themselves.
03-407 +++$+++ 6664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, okay. No. I agree with you. If in fact you think that there's a problem about a real indigent bringing a claim in Michigan, although we have two on the docket, if I accepted that premise, I would begin to think you were right. So then what I was trying to explore is whether the whole thing comes down to whether I accept that premise. And of course, that's what's everybody has been talking about, and I do see at the moment a couple of very good ways that indigents can bring it themselves, and indeed they have.
03-407 +++$+++ 6665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I think --
03-407 +++$+++ 6666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But everything comes down to that. Right?
03-407 +++$+++ 6667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think an answer I need to give to -- to cut through all of this is that third party standing is never predicated on the impossible. Third party standing is never predicated on the idea that third party standing is appropriate only if it is impossible for some indigent to make it into court or some third party or the person whose rights are being violated to make it into court. All that must be shown from this Court's precedents is a hindrance. So this Court did not require in Craig v. Boren that it was impossible that some young man could get his claim in front of the court.
03-407 +++$+++ 6668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was altogether possible there had been a young man. The problem was he turned 21. So the case would -- from his point of view was moot.
03-407 +++$+++ 6669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, but this Court never suggested that it was -- showing that it was impossible for someone to quickly get his claim before the court was --
03-407 +++$+++ 6670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think I agree with you on that. I'm just -- the reason I think it's so easy is because we get indigents. We get thousands of them. And all you have to have is some indigent saying, hey, I want a lawyer. Okay? That's all. He has to be able to write those words. And at that point, you and the others come in with amicus briefs, if necessary, and support him.
03-407 +++$+++ 6671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the problem is is that in the meantime thousands of Michigan indigents are going to be denied counsel.
03-407 +++$+++ 6672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you a practical question about what is currently before the Court? Mr. Casey I think told us that the Halbert case is on for the October 8th conference. If we should grant cert in either of those direct from the Michigan Supreme Court -- Michigan Supreme Court following Bulger, so you always leave before then. If we should grant in either of those cases, wouldn't the wise thing be to simply hold this case till those are decided?
03-407 +++$+++ 6673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That may well be a wise course of action -- action, Justice Ginsburg. I should point out that Mr. Casey, when he filed the response to the Bulger cert petition, brought this Court's attention to the fact that this underlying litigation was proceeding in a case that was then called Tesmer v. Granholm. And so he brought to this Court's attention that we had already prevailed in Federal district court in Tesmer v. Granholm as a suggestion as to why this Court did not need to grant cert in the Bulger case, and so this Court did not grant cert. I don't know, of course -- I don't know why this Court did not grant cert in Bulger.
03-407 +++$+++ 6674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But he said now he's not taking that position in the Halbert case.
03-407 +++$+++ 6675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I can be confident that if there are any procedural hurdles to this Court's exercise of jurisdiction in any of the State cases, Mr. Casey will alert this Court of them. And there may well be. For example, in the Melody Harris case, the Michigan Supreme Court remanded for further -- remanded for her to then file an application for leave to appeal on her underlying plea and sentencing issues without the assistance of counsel. Was the Michigan Supreme Court's order a final order? I don't know. This Court would obviously have to resolve that. But I can be confident that Mr. Casey will certainly bring up any procedural hurdles. And of course, this Court cannot exercise jurisdiction it does not have in a case just because it would be more convenient to do so. This Court does have jurisdiction in this case. The petitioners never challenged prudential standing at any point in this litigation -- they -- they challenged only article III standing, injury in fact -- until this Court. And so part of the reason we don't have a better record is because this came on a motion to dismiss. This Court recognized in Lujan that a motion to dismiss is different than a summary judgment, requires a -- a different procedural posture. It requires the assumption of facts being true.
03-407 +++$+++ 6676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but no facts -- no additional facts would -- would affect the central point that -- that we've been devoting most of this discussion to, which is whether there is an impediment or not to -- to the -- the actual individuals whose rights your clients are asserting raising their own rights. No additional facts bear upon that it seems to me.
03-407 +++$+++ 6677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I agree with you on that, Justice Scalia.
03-407 +++$+++ 6678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then what case holds that there must be an impediment for the third party? I keep coming back to Craig against Boren. They could have filed another class action and say that they filed a class action and had standing. Would we have suddenly decided we won't decide the merits even though it's been argued and both sides have had their day in court?
03-407 +++$+++ 6679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I agree with you, Justice Stevens.
03-407 +++$+++ 6680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is the source of the requirement there must be an impediment to the third party suit?
03-407 +++$+++ 6681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, this Court has said so many times, and Powers v. Ohio, for example, noted the impediment to the --
03-407 +++$+++ 6682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- where they granted standing.
03-407 +++$+++ 6683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right.
03-407 +++$+++ 6684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Have they ever denied standing on the ground that there was no impediment to the third party suit? I don't think we have.
03-407 +++$+++ 6685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't believe in all of the cases that both parties cited that there are any cases in which this Court has said that there was no impediment to the third party. It is -- it is certainly not the standard --
03-407 +++$+++ 6686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, do you think that was just idle observation then?
03-407 +++$+++ 6687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice. I didn't mean to be light about that.
03-407 +++$+++ 6688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't have to be idle to be dicta, though, does it?
03-407 +++$+++ 6689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There -- we -- we fully concede there need to be an impediment, but what it does not require is the showing that it is impossible for someone to get here. What is a showing is that for most -- for the average person in the class, just like the average grand juror in Campbell v. Louisiana, or the average venire person in Powers v. Ohio, there are impediments to getting here.
03-407 +++$+++ 6690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you fully concede there must be an impediment even though the Court has never so held?
03-407 +++$+++ 6691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm willing to concede that because it is so clear to me that there is, that there is an impediment that trying to get into Federal court, trying to get here, for that matter, trying to get into Federal district court -- for an indigent, a typical person who is very likely -- someone like Mr. Carter, functionally illiterate, poorly educated, completely unaware of his rights, to try and navigate the -- the procedural hurdles of the Michigan system to get all the way through the Michigan system and then into Federal court, that is a daunting hurdle. And that's Evitts v. Lucey. This Court has recognized time and time again in -- in plea cases, Roe v. -- Roe v. Flores-Ortega. This Court has recognized time and time again in Peguero that even in a plea case a typical indigent is completely incapable of getting his or her case held -- heard, especially if you have to go through multiple layers of appeal without a counsel for the first tier. And that is the problem here. On the merits, I certainly would like to correct Mr. Casey's representations about the -- the nature of the Michigan system. The -- a properly filed application for leave to appeal is invariably denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented. I certainly urge this Court to look at each and every one of the cases that Mr. Casey has cited for the proposition that that is not a determination on the merits because not one of them says that. Not one of them specifically says that a order denying leave for lack of merit on the grounds presented is not a decision on the merits.
03-407 +++$+++ 6692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could -- could you give me an example, just from your experience in practice, where there's an important issue raised after a guilty plea that requires an appeal where it's not one of the statutory exceptions?
03-407 +++$+++ 6693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Many, many.
03-407 +++$+++ 6694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Most -- what are -- what are those cases?
03-407 +++$+++ 6695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Improper denial of jail credit, making -- improper denial of jail credit.
03-407 +++$+++ 6696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not sentencing?
03-407 +++$+++ 6697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is a sentencing error.
03-407 +++$+++ 6698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay, but that's covered by the statute.
03-407 +++$+++ 6699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it's not. The statute -- the only exceptions in the statute are for guidelines departures --
03-407 +++$+++ 6700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
03-407 +++$+++ 6701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and for -- and then if the indigent gets the appeal granted, but that's putting -- that's after the indigent has had to file an application identifying his or her own issues without any assistance of counsel. Double jeopardy issues. Double jeopardy issues arise in Michigan all the time; whether sentences should be consecutive or concurrent; whether there's been a breach of the plea bargain. All of these issues arise in Michigan courts every day, and while we are --
03-407 +++$+++ 6702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are there instances where Michigan has denied the right to appeal when those claims are raised?
03-407 +++$+++ 6703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The problem, Your Honor, is that an indigent can't raise -- a typical indigent would be completely incapable of identifying this -- these sorts of issues.
03-407 +++$+++ 6704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ His counsel will have raised them. And -- and most, if not all, of those have to have been raised by counsel.
03-407 +++$+++ 6705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, Michigan requires that ineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on direct appeal. So if counsel has not raised the issue, then the indigent would have to recognize that by -- by himself, and then raise that issue, the ineffective assistance of counsel, on direct appeal. Further, even if counsel has recognized it, what we typically would have would be an oral objection at a sentencing hearing. For example, Your Honor, I think these sentences should be concurrent, and the judge says, no, I'm going to make them consecutive. That's an oral objection. The indigent will have to be able to get the transcripts, get the register of actions, get all the necessary documents, realize that that's a winning issue, that it does not put him at additional risk. That's another factor. One of the -- one of the points that a counsel can help with is tell an indigent, you don't want to take this appeal because success may result in revocation of the plea bargain and an additional risk -- will have to realize that this is in my best interest to go ahead with this appeal. This is my issue. Find the cases, find the controlling authority. And even issues as complex as a Blakely issue, which this Court, of course, will be dealing with this afternoon, that is an open issue of Michigan law right now. Is -- are the Michigan sentencing guidelines unconstitutional or at least the application of them as a result of this Court's decision in Blakely? Right now, as a result of the order in Melody Harris, a typical Michigan indigent will have to raise that complex issue of Sixth Amendment law by herself or by himself, and that's simply an impossible burden, or the issue will be lost forever. And that is -- that is a burden that no indigent can meet. And so I would hope that this Court would not get hung up on the standing issue because this issue is so important right now, as a result of the Michigan Supreme Court's order. Right now these issues are happening and right now Michigan indigents are being denied the assistance of counsel. Unique in the Nation. And so this case has been adversely argued. That's the point of prudential standing. The petitioners waived the prudential standing issues below. They challenged only article III standing. And so there is every reason for this Court not to wait for a perfect case that may never come.
03-407 +++$+++ 6706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are you familiar with the Halbert case? You mentioned that there might be a finality problem in Harris.
03-407 +++$+++ 6707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not familiar with that case, Your Honor. I just became aware of it by letter a few days ago and I have not had a chance to find out anything more about it. I have not seen the cert petition in that case. I'm not aware of the underlying -- excuse me -- the underlying order from the Michigan courts in that case. But there may never be a perfect case, but this case is adverse and that meets all the -- all the requirements for prudential standing. Article III standing is clearly met in this case, and I hope this Court will affirm the decision of the Sixth Circuit. If this Court has no further questions.
03-407 +++$+++ 6708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Moran. Mr. Casey, you have 3 minutes left.
03-407 +++$+++ 6710 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Did you waive the objection to prudential standing --
03-407 +++$+++ 6711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We did not waive any of the standing claims in this case. We've discussed that in our reply brief. I've cited pages of the briefs where these issues were discussed. And the overriding fact is that the district court, the three-judge panel in the court of appeals, and the en banc Sixth Circuit all decided these issues. They have been properly raised and preserved and they're before the Court.
03-407 +++$+++ 6712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Did you file a brief in opposition in Halbert?
03-407 +++$+++ 6713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I did. I filed that about a month ago.
03-407 +++$+++ 6714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And does that have any procedural impediments?
03-407 +++$+++ 6715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not to my knowledge. That individual was convicted in pleas, asked for counsel citing the Federal litigation in this Kowalski v. Tesmer case. It was denied. He filed a pro se application for leave to appeal challenging the denial of counsel and raising his sentencing issues --
03-407 +++$+++ 6716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So what was the basis for your opposition to cert?
03-407 +++$+++ 6717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That the Court need not grant cert in that case because the issue is pending in this case. If -- if this case goes away, then I suspect we will agree that that would be an appropriate vehicle to decide the constitutional issue. As long as this case is pending in which the issue is raised, I suggested that the Court need not grant cert in that case to decide the issue. If the issue is not going to be decided in this case, then that would be an appropriate vehicle to raise and decide the issue. On the standing point, if the plaintiffs here are given standing, it would be a significant expansion of this Court's standing doctrine. This Court has never found third party standing when a litigant is not directly affected by a statute and there is no close existing relationship with the third party and there is no hindrance. We've discussed many cases in which some of these factors are present and others are distinguishing factors. This -- this case is, in some respects, unlike all of them. There would be a significant expansion of the doctrine. On the merits of the issue, a constitutional right to appointed counsel, under the Michigan system, please read the cases I've cited in my brief, particularly the Bobenal decision, which I've cited in my principal brief. In a footnote in my brief, I quote the orders that the court of appeals was considering. They have the same language that is at issue here. Controlling Michigan precedent says that applications for leave to appeal are not decisions on the merits. All an inmate has to do is identify the issues. That can be done. It has been done, as seen by the two pending petitions for cert. If the Court has no further questions.
03-407 +++$+++ 6718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Casey. The case is submitted.
03-409 +++$+++ 6722 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument now on number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. versus Lasting Impression, Inc. Mr. Machat?
03-409 +++$+++ 6724 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns whether or not a defendant in a trademark case who fulfills the statutory requirements of the fair-use defense must also demonstrate an absence of likelihood of confusion in order to avail himself of that affirmative defense. Now, here are four reasons why that should not be the case. In the first place, if that is the case it would render the defense useless, because if there is no likelihood of confusion, then there's no trademark infringement to begin with, so why should someone try to prove an affirmative defense when there's no trademark infringement? Second --
03-409 +++$+++ 6725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You agree with Judge Niemeyer's comment in the Fourth Circuit case, I take it.
03-409 +++$+++ 6726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Secondly, what it does is, is it shifts the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant. There's no reason ever to -- there's no reason ever to prove an absence of likelihood of confusion if you're a defendant. And then, also there's no reason to prove the fair-use defense if you have to also prove an absence of likelihood of confusion, because it's just much more of a burden. You have to prove, first of all --
03-409 +++$+++ 6727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In this case, did the plaintiff offer any evidence of confusion, consumer confusion?
03-409 +++$+++ 6728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This was a motion for summary judgement.
03-409 +++$+++ 6729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And was there anything in the affidavits or attachments that have to do with consumer confusion on behalf of the plaintiff?
03-409 +++$+++ 6730 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yeah, actually, the record does contain some references to confusion. The -- in this case, the respondent, they were claiming that they did have some people that actually were confused. And when that happens, you need to look at what is causing the confusion. And essentially --
03-409 +++$+++ 6731 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it might make it necessary for a defendant in such a situation, in order to avoid some kind of summary judgement, to also offer evidence on consumer confusion to try to show there wasn't any.
03-409 +++$+++ 6732 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but that's shifting the issue, then, to whether or not there's likelihood of confusion. However, even if there -- what I'm saying is even if there is confusion, if you meet the elements of the fair-use defense, it doesn't matter if there's any resulting confusion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6733 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, is it possible that showing consumer confusion could be considered by the court on the issue of what's the fair use? What's fair?
03-409 +++$+++ 6734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the thing is, a lot of times when there is confusion, that is evidence that the term or the word being used is not being used as a mark, so the confusion illustrates that -- one of the elements of the fair-use defense, whether or not the term is being used descriptively or as a mark, whether or not those elements are being met. The confusion does not go to the likelihood of confusion issue; rather, it goes to the individual elements of the fair-use --
03-409 +++$+++ 6735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but I'm interested in Justice O'Connor's point. Suppose it's a close case as to whether or not the use is in good faith and it's only discretion. With reference to good faith, suppose there's very substantial confusion that's caused by the allegedly infringing mark. Does that at least bear on a good-faith assessment? In other words, suppose that it were shown that the owner of the non-registered mark, the alleged infringing mark, used the phrase -- not the mark, but used the phrase -- deliberately in order to cause confusion. Would that --
03-409 +++$+++ 6736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes -- well, that would show an absence of good faith, and good faith is one of the elements of the fair-use defense.
03-409 +++$+++ 6737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, so that if you know that there's going to be confusion, there is no good faith? You wouldn't go that far.
03-409 +++$+++ 6738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I wouldn't go that far. It's a balancing Test and that's why it says "fairly and in good faith," and you have to look at how descriptive the word is, in particular. For instance, if you're using the word "best" -- as in "best buy" or "best foods" -- I mean, best is an extremely descriptive word. So you could go a lot further in claiming, "Hey, I have the best -- I have the best food," or, you know, "Come to my store. I have the best buy." And, yes, there could be confusion, but that is one of the risks that --
03-409 +++$+++ 6739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, is it your position that subjective good faith is always a defense, no matter how unreasonable it is or how much confusion results? Is that your position?
03-409 +++$+++ 6740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I wouldn't go that far, because you also have to look at the objective use.
03-409 +++$+++ 6741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would have thought that consumer confusion is one factor in determining fairness; perhaps not subjective good faith, but certainly on the issue of fairness. Some of the amici take that position, do they not?
03-409 +++$+++ 6742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think -- I was reading the amici brief last night. I think the issue of confusion, as the INTA brief points out, you have to look at whether the confusion is illustrative of whether or not the term is being used as a mark or not. The same evidence that shows confusion can be used to show a likelihood of confusion on the plaintiff's side of the case, and that same evidence can also be used to -- in the case of determining whether or not the elements of a fair use defense have been -- have been met.
03-409 +++$+++ 6743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What did -- what did the district court do here? Did it grant summary judgement or deny summary judgement?
03-409 +++$+++ 6744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- well, the district court granted summary judgement on a fair-use defense. It found that, in this case, the mark was being used -- sorry, that my client's words were being used not as a mark, only to describe, and that the use was done fairly and in good faith. The Ninth Circuit --
03-409 +++$+++ 6745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the district court -- the district court -- this way -- [Laughter.]
03-409 +++$+++ 6746 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- seemed to focus on the use of the word "micro color," just the word. It didn't bring up what was new in 1999. That is, a brochure appears where "micro color" is not simply a word, but it appears in a logo-like fashion. And as I understand it, the district court said you could use "micro color" as you had been using it since 1991. It didn't refer to the stylized 1999 new brochure. So --
03-409 +++$+++ 6747 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, that is correct. The district court, in its opinion, did not specifically refer to that use in 1999.
03-409 +++$+++ 6748 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it might not have been confusion just by using the word. But when you're using it in the logo-like appearance, maybe that's different.
03-409 +++$+++ 6749 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in the abstract case, it could be. I would argue, though, in this case it's not, because that was one use on a -- you have a ten-page brochure, and it's one use on a ten-page brochure. And you -- on that same page of the brochure, at the very bottom, it said my client's name, KP Permanent Makeup. So --
03-409 +++$+++ 6750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that wouldn't relate to the question presented here, anyway. It wouldn't relate to the reason for which we took this case.
03-409 +++$+++ 6751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct.
03-409 +++$+++ 6752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, maybe the district court misinterpreted or misapplied "fairly and in good faith" if it didn't consider the logo-like use. But, as I understand it, the only question we have before us is whether the "fairly and in good faith" provision is an exception even when there is confusion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I would agree.
03-409 +++$+++ 6754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that -- I'm -- and I'm mixed up. I thought that the issue is whether you, on your side, have to present evidence of no confusion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6755 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I think --
03-409 +++$+++ 6756 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So as far as --
03-409 +++$+++ 6757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- I think we're both saying the same thing
03-409 +++$+++ 6758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So as far as Justice O'Connor's question is concerned, I thought your answer would be, if they want to go and present evidence that there is confusion, to the point where it's so obviously unfair, it's ridiculous, they can do it. I mean, do you object to that?
03-409 +++$+++ 6759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I agree.
03-409 +++$+++ 6760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. So your answer to her question is, of course it could be relevant. Let the other side come in and show that it's relevant. You don't have to show that there is no confusion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-409 +++$+++ 6762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's where we are, is that right?
03-409 +++$+++ 6763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly --
03-409 +++$+++ 6764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
03-409 +++$+++ 6765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- where we are.
03-409 +++$+++ 6766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could you give us a -- I'd be much more sympathetic to your case if I could readily envision a situation where there is confusion but, nonetheless, the use is fair and in good faith. Give me a clear example.
03-409 +++$+++ 6767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In my particular case? This --
03-409 +++$+++ 6768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I mean, make up one --
03-409 +++$+++ 6769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
03-409 +++$+++ 6770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that's really clear.
03-409 +++$+++ 6771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let's use the words "best buy." Best Buy is a famous consumer electronics store, and somebody opens up a shop, say Mark's, that says, "Mark's, he has the best buy." He wants to advertise on radio, "Come down to Mark's Electronics for the best buy - for the best buy in consumer electronics, go to Mark's," and he keeps using those words "best buy."
03-409 +++$+++ 6772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think there's any likelihood of confusion there, do you? I mean --
03-409 +++$+++ 6773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-409 +++$+++ 6774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- what if he just takes out an ad that says, "Best Buy," exclamation point? That would be closer.
03-409 +++$+++ 6775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, in that case there would be confusion, but Mark, in that case, would be using "best buy" as a trademark, not only to describe; and, therefore, he would not fulfill the statutory requirements of a fair use defense. Because a lot of times when confusion comes up, it comes up in the case that --
03-409 +++$+++ 6776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I didn't mean to make it that in my hypothetical. You're just putting it in bold type at the beginning of the piece, "Best Buy," exclamation point. That means it's a trademark?
03-409 +++$+++ 6777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it would be evidence that it is a trademark. You have to -- it depends how big the words "best buy" were in relation to the word "Mark's Electronics."
03-409 +++$+++ 6778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but if you had a -- if you had a headline at the head of an ad, "Great Sale," that surely is not a trademark, just because you have it in boldfaced print.
03-409 +++$+++ 6779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I agree, it's not necessarily a trademark. You have to look at the totality of the ad, and you have to look at what the person is trying to use to tell consumers to identify and distinguish the products, or, in this case, the store.
03-409 +++$+++ 6780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I suppose if you have a sign that says "Park `n Fly" and an arrow, with a capital "P" and a capital "F," then it's arguably being used as a trademark.
03-409 +++$+++ 6781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-409 +++$+++ 6782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Whereas, if you say in a brochure, "Rent a car from us, and park and fly," then that's okay. Is that the distinction?
03-409 +++$+++ 6783 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but I'd go even further and say that the -- if you had a big sign that said "Park `n Fly," and it's next to an airport, that would not necessarily be a trademark. I mean, if it said, like, "Jerry's Airport Parking, Park and Fly," I would say that's being a descriptive use. But some people may argue differently in that case.
03-409 +++$+++ 6784 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit, as I understand it, did put an initial burden on the trademark-holder to prove confusion. If you look at the petition for cert, 6a, in its opinion, it seems to recognize that the trademark-holder must show that the alleged infringer's use of the mark is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive. So this opinion starts out by saying, "Yes, we know that under the Lanham Act the trademark-holder is obliged to show likelihood of confusion."
03-409 +++$+++ 6785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They do it. But then on -- if you look on page 17a of my cert petition, the same opinion, the Ninth Circuit later on go on to say, in the middle paragraph, "As expressed in Kahn's, the fair-use analysis only complements the likelihood of confusion -- likelihood of customer confusion analysis." And then they quote from Transgo, and they say -- explain that "anyone is free to use a term in its primary descriptive sense as long as such use does not result in consumer confusion as to the source of goods." In effect, what they're doing is, they're expanding the rights of trademark-holders of descriptive words. Essentially what they're saying is --
03-409 +++$+++ 6786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they go further in that same paragraph, and the last couple of lines refer to a Lindy Pen case, according to -- the way they described, explaining that the fair-use defense is not available if likelihood of confusion has been shown.
03-409 +++$+++ 6787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, and that's -- that's where they're negating what they said in the beginning of their opinion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They do have one authority for that proposition. They cite McCarthy, and I think they're right about that.
03-409 +++$+++ 6789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they do cite McCarthy, but I would submit that McCarthy is incorrect, in this case.
03-409 +++$+++ 6790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there is a treatise writer who does take the position that if there's confusion, there's no fair-use defense.
03-409 +++$+++ 6791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there are other treatise writers -- Kane, for example, takes the contrary position and says that fair use will always be a defense, even if -even if there is likelihood of confusion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So does the -- what is it -- the unfair competition restatement?
03-409 +++$+++ 6793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, that takes a similar position, as well, that there can be confusion and fair use at the same time. Again, you have to look at what's causing the confusion. And most often the problem is the confusion is being caused because the person with the words in question is using it as a mark, and that's causing the confusion. If -- there's certain -- there's certain -- there's certain terms and words that Congress has said never get trademark protection. Descriptive words, of course, is one of them, in the sense that they can never get trademark protection in their primary descriptive sense; they only get trademark protection in their -- in their secondary-meaning sense if they can actually prove secondary meaning.
03-409 +++$+++ 6794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I thought we're dealing with an incontestable mark here, and the secondary meaning would be assumed.
03-409 +++$+++ 6795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. In the case of an incontestable mark, secondary meaning is presumed; however, that still does not take away the burden of the holder of an incontestable mark of proving likelihood of confusion. And, second, the trademark protection attaches only to the secondary meaning of the mark, never to the primary, descriptive meaning of the words in question. And one other quick example. The laws say you cannot obtain a trademark in the U.S. flag. Now, we have 12 ice-cream manufacturers, they each put the flag on their ice cream. There will be confusion there. Someone will say, "I want the ice cream with the flag on it." But they all have a flag on it. That's another example where Congress said, "We will tolerate confusion." Sometimes we tolerate confusion so we can free up descriptive words so business owners are free to describe their goods to consumers. And, if I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
03-409 +++$+++ 6796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Very well, Mr. Machat. Now, Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.
03-409 +++$+++ 6798 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Scalia, you asked for an example of a case where there might be confusion, but there would still be a fair use. This Court's decision in William Warner versus Eli Lilly, which was a common-law case cited on page 27 of our brief, gives an example of that. You had Coco-quinine, and Quin-coco being sold. And this Court held, as a matter of the common law fair-use doctrine, that the descriptive -- fair, truthful, descriptive use of a term to describe a product will be permitted even if consumer mistakes result. There are other cases cited in the briefs. Howe Scale is cited in our brief. The Canal Company versus Clark case. The fair-use defense that's at issue here takes its -- has its roots in that common law precedent, and that common law precedent, in origin, speaks directly, Justice O'Connor, to your -- and Justice Kennedy -- to your questions about, what does a fairness component of this test in the statute mean. There is not a general requirement that the -- say, the defendant here; the parties were reversed, but the non-trademark holder acts fairly. That's not what Congress said. It says the term -- and I'm -- and you can see, on page 9a of the statutory appendix to our brief -- the term has to be used fairly and in good faith -- putting that aside, used fairly only to describe the product. That is not some sort of general equitable receptacle for fairness concerns. That focuses on what the defendant did and how they acted in describing. That's not a test of how the public reacted. How did the defendant behave? Which is exactly what William Warner, Canal Company, and Howe Scale also looked at. In common parlance, in a common dictionary meaning, when you talk about fairly describing something, that's not general equity. That is, is it a legitimate, reasonable, proper, objectively apt, and fair way to describe a product. One could reasonably --
03-409 +++$+++ 6799 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, does -- does consumer -- if substantial consumer confusion is shown by the plaintiff, is that enough to defeat a fair-use defense?
03-409 +++$+++ 6800 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not by itself, no, Justice O'Connor. Congress told us what will defeat the defense, and that is a -- that is a conclusion that the term is being used as a mark. Consumer confusion might be, if you could explain that that demonstrates that it's being used as a mark. It might show that you're not objectively, reasonably, accurately describing your product. If I describe Twinkies as a sugary snack, that's a -- I can fairly describe Twinkies as a sugary snack. I can't fairly describe Twinkies as a healthy food.
03-409 +++$+++ 6801 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose, in the Coco-quinine case, the non -- the non-holder is doing just fine without using the particular term, and then he decides, "you know, I'm going to cut into that market, and I'm going to use the term Coco-quinine. And I'm going to do that just in order to get more customers away from the trademark-holder." Is that good faith?
03-409 +++$+++ 6802 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, because there's nothing, in the marketplace, with wanting to increase your business and to do better and to use descriptive terms descriptively to do that. The good-faith --
03-409 +++$+++ 6803 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what --
03-409 +++$+++ 6804 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- continued here --
03-409 +++$+++ 6805 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- what if he intends to increase his market share precisely by causing the confusion? That would eliminate the good-faith element, wouldn't it?
03-409 +++$+++ 6806 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The good-faith element is, do I intend -- it depends on what you mean by "causing confusion." If I intend to freeload or ride or exploit the secondary --
03-409 +++$+++ 6807 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yeah.
03-409 +++$+++ 6808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- meaning of the term --
03-409 +++$+++ 6809 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-409 +++$+++ 6810 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that's what good faith means in trademark law, generally. It has an established component.
03-409 +++$+++ 6811 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-409 +++$+++ 6812 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If I intend to do that. But just showing that consumer confusion could result, or that I hope consumers will pause and think about, you know, "what -- what's in the -- what am I now being offered in the marketplace?" But I have to -- if I intend to avail myself of the secondary meaning that you've established of the goodwill that you've generated, that's what good faith goes to. But to use fairly to describe is not a general means of just saying --
03-409 +++$+++ 6813 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask you --
03-409 +++$+++ 6814 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- if there's confusion, that's a bad --
03-409 +++$+++ 6815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What does the term "micro color" describe?
03-409 +++$+++ 6816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The term "micro color" describes -- this is not my area of expertise, but -- describes, as I understand it, the inks that are used for this permanent make-up process. And the reason it's called "micro color" --
03-409 +++$+++ 6817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does it have a meaning in any context other than describing the -- one party's product in this case?
03-409 +++$+++ 6818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I wouldn't begin to know whether other professions or occupations use the term "micro color." But my understanding, from the record, is that the color is obvious. That's -- it's different color inks. And the reason that they use the term "micro" -- and this is on page, I believe, 98 of the first volume of the joint appendix, is that the molecular size of these inks is very, very fine. It's going into the skin. It's micron-size. And so that's, I think, the -- as suggested by petitioner's client -- that that's the origin of the term "micro color." Now, "micro" is a common term that's -- common descriptive term in its own right. It appears in many contexts. Obviously, computers is one that we're all familiar with. Medical devices often will refer to "micro." But "micro color" --
03-409 +++$+++ 6819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wasn't there -- wasn't there something to the effect that "micro pigmentation" is a synonym in the trade for permanent make-up? It's another name for permanent make-up, and it's -- it has "micro" in it, "micro pigmentation."
03-409 +++$+++ 6820 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's my understanding, yes.
03-409 +++$+++ 6821 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ "Micro pigmentation" sounds awfully close to "micro color."
03-409 +++$+++ 6822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ "Micro color," yeah. That's my understanding. Again, I don't really want to weigh in on one side of the dispute or the other on the merits of whether "micro color" is a generic or a --
03-409 +++$+++ 6823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you have to weigh in on it. I mean, you have to show that the -- it seems to me, if you think that side should win, that the words are being used in a descriptive sense. And if "micro color" doesn't mean a blessed thing to anybody unless they associate it with the trademark, then, it seems to me, you lose.
03-409 +++$+++ 6824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Justice Scalia, the problem here is that the Ninth Circuit said that what makes them lose is not that they didn't use this fairly to describe their product, or not that they failed to act in good faith, or not that they were using this as a trademark, but that it was a --
03-409 +++$+++ 6825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're right, that's not the issue in the case.
03-409 +++$+++ 6826 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. Right. And my understanding -- again, the record shows that, in fact, the descriptive use of this was conceded in this case, and that's on page 29a of the petition appendix, and also in the joint appendix on 152.
03-409 +++$+++ 6827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're right.
03-409 +++$+++ 6828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, again, our concern is that this statute has to be read with the terms Congress enacted. Congress drew a balance here. Congress struck the balance between allowing -- giving unprecedented protection that this Court recognized in "Park 'n Fly" to descriptive terms, but policing the line between the secondary meaning that attaches to descriptive terms and the -- reserving for the marketplace, for competition, the availability of descriptive terms in their original descriptive sense.
03-409 +++$+++ 6829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In other words, if you choose to use a descriptive term as your logo, you take your chances --
03-409 +++$+++ 6830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Exactly.
03-409 +++$+++ 6831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that that descriptive term will be used fairly and in good faith by somebody else and cause confusion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Exactly.
03-409 +++$+++ 6833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And if you don't want confusion, pick a term that isn't descriptive.
03-409 +++$+++ 6834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly right. There's a tradeoff. When you pick a descriptive term, you get right up front, right up front, the immediate appeal and resonance of a term to the -- to the consumers. "Best buy." Who wouldn't want the best buy? I want the best buy. "Chunky" candy bars. It's going to be easier to break into the marketplace with "Chunky" candy bars or "Almond Joy" candy bars, because consumers will have a sense of what they're getting, than if you come in with a --
03-409 +++$+++ 6835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ "Schwartz," "Schwartz" candy bars.
03-409 +++$+++ 6836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ "Schwartz" candy bar, "Kodak," I don't know
03-409 +++$+++ 6837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't do anything for you. [Laughter.]
03-409 +++$+++ 6838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know why that is, and why would I want to eat it. They're going to have to do more work. But the downside, the tradeoff, is, as you said, Justice Scalia, that you do not get to take those terms out of usage. Trademark law protects usage, not words. And if the usage is descriptive, and it's fair, in the sense that it's reasonable, apt, and accurate, as this Court said in William Warner, Canal Company, Howe Scale, in the unfair-competition sense; and the Kellogg versus National Biscuit Company, the Shredded Wheat case, if it's apt and accurate, that's what "used fairly" means. And if its satisfies that objective test, and if it satisfies the subjective good-faith test, and it's not used as a mark, we will tolerate that confusion, because that --
03-409 +++$+++ 6839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do you tell whether it's used as a mark? I mean, is that -- that certainly seems to be central. Is it used as a mark? And if it's used as a mark, then there is a violation.
03-409 +++$+++ 6840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The fair-use defense is unavailable if it's used as a mark. There are other --
03-409 +++$+++ 6841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-409 +++$+++ 6842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- defenses that are available, but the fair-use defense is, by definition, unavailable. That's correct. The way you prove whether something is used as a mark -- there's, sort of, two ways of getting to that end. When something is used as a mark, that means it is signifying to the origin or source of those goods in the marketplace. It's not just describing it, it's telling you who is making it or who is putting it out on the market.
03-409 +++$+++ 6843 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So let's go back to the use on the brochure of a logo-like -- I mean, as long as they're using just the word "micro color," I see your position entirely, it's used descriptively, not as a mark. But what about when they use something that looks like a mark?
03-409 +++$+++ 6844 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there's -- there's going to be difficult questions of proof. Our position is that, by taking a descriptive term, you don't get to consign everybody else to ten point Times New Roman font, and that they can do some colorful display, but not a mark.
03-409 +++$+++ 6845 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Ms. Millett. Ms. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you.
03-409 +++$+++ 6847 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. BRINKMANN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Defendant's - Petitioner's absolute defense is contrary to the text, purpose, structure and history of the fair-use defense of the Lanham Act. In response to Justice Scalia's question about this is the risk that someone takes when they choose a descriptive term, this defense does not apply only to descriptive terms. Under Petitioner's view, this defense would be available to users of arbitrary, fanciful and suggestive marks so long as they were used descriptively and not as a mark.

04-1084 +++$+++ 13209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I was -- I was trying to answer Justice Scalia's question. But let me say this. And of course I would read the language of the commentary and the INCB and the opinion of our former ambassador, Herbert Okun, in Brazil and France. But let me also say, if I may, that the position of the executive, until this -- until this litigation, has been the same. And the reason we know that is precisely what you said, Your Honor. Mescaline is also covered by the Treaty. Peyote is not. The Native --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- American --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- thought that's because we made a special reservation for peyote.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Mr. Chief Justice. We did make a special reservation, but it didn't matter yet, because it's never been covered. That reservation, if you go back and look at what the Senate said at the time, and what -- there are no plants. They're just not listed in the Treaty. The purpose of the reservation was, in an abundance of caution, in case it would be -- in case it would be added in the future, then plants, and solutions from plants, would be covered. But as it stands now, members of the Native American Church drink a tea containing peyote and --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, are you --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- mescaline.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- saying that there are -- there's basically an ambiguity in the Treaty, that solutions derived from plants are not covered, but solutions that include DMT are covered, and there -- therefore, there is a question?
04-1084 +++$+++ 13217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- yes, the ambiguity arises because what the Treaty means is that if you were to extract the DMT and then add it to something, which can't be done here and could have no religious meaning for the UDV, and we're not even sure if -- chemically, if it's possible. If you were to extract it and then add it, then you would have a solution containing DMT. And that's --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But solution is defined by the number of steps in the process that gets the substance into the water? Is that --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- correct?
04-1084 +++$+++ 13221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- Your Honor, I didn't write this Treaty, and I -- and I must say -- [Laughter.]
04-1084 +++$+++ 13222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, I'm not blaming you --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that it --

04-1084 +++$+++ 13225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that it --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- but I --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that it -- [Laughter.]
04-1084 +++$+++ 13228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not the clear -- the clearest writing, but we know -- we know what its meaning is, and we do have to look at the travaux, which goes into long detail about why they even mention plants, because of their fear, in the future, that plants might be covered. Now, other plants are covered --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- in a different Treaty. But --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I make a suggestion as to why, even if it is covered by the Treaty, it may not be a compelling State interest to comply with the Treaty?
04-1084 +++$+++ 13232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Say yes. Let me him make that --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. [Laughter.]
04-1084 +++$+++ 13234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm just waiting. [Laughter.]
04-1084 +++$+++ 13235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was the right answer.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm just trying --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because I haven't --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to be polite.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- it made. I -- I mean, isn't it well-established that statutes trump treaties, that if Congress decides, in a subsequent statute, to ignore a Treaty, it may do so? Now, if this RFRA can trump a statute, it would seem to me, a fortiori, it can trump a Treaty.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, it can, Your Honor. It can trump the Treaty, and that -- and that is --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So, compliance --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- correct.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- with a Treaty is not necessarily a compelling State interest.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is not. And -- but we don't even have to go that far, because, if we do the RFRA analysis, the Government must show a compelling interest to the person and, in addition --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, surely --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- surely RFRA doesn't say that you disregard treaties or you disregard statutes in determining what's a compelling interest.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. You don't disregard them, Your Honor, but --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And getting back to the first question that Justice Breyer asked -- and then we got off on what the Treaty really means -- but assuming that the Treaty does prohibit the importation of this substance -- assuming that -- is there any evidence that the District Court thought that this was a compelling interest?
04-1084 +++$+++ 13250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the -- no, the District Court --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ None at all.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- analyzed the Treaty differently, and analyzed the Treaty to not apply to hoasca, for all the reasons that are -- that are in his opinion in our brief. And, therefore --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So, if we disagree with you on the Treaty, then the appellate court's opinion doesn't really even address the point whether or not this and/or the statute, together, can be a compelling interest.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. If you disagree with the District Court on that, then the case should be remanded for it to -- for additional --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't know if there isn't a factual question here. I mean, I thought Justice Scalia, if it were to be up to him, did take into account official commentaries to treaties. But maybe he doesn't. Anyway, I take them into account. And I -- and in respect to that, I read this as saying, specifically, that the plants -- it doesn't include the substance if it is a substance clearly distinguished from the substance constituting its active principal -- and the example they give is mimosa root, which contains DMT.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's true. And --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And then, that's also true of the bananas and pineapples, et cetera. And there's a court holding that hoasca's out of it, in France and one in the Netherlands, all of which I think was relevant to a Treaty. All right? Now, the Government has come in with a counterargument and said it clearly does cover, I guess, even mimosa roots, where they are imported solely for the purpose of extracting DMT. Now, what's the response to that?
04-1084 +++$+++ 13258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The response to that, Your Honor, is that there is no DMT extracted in this case. Although the Government said that in their brief, there is no evidence of that, and it is contrary to the evidence --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it has to be extracted at some point to be -- to get into -- I'm right here -- to get into the tea, right? It's extracted by the preparation of the tea.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Mr. Chief --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The plants are not -- the plants are not imported, right? Just the tea.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The tea is imported. But the --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- but the tea is made just like you would make tea if you mixed chamomile and mint, and then --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and then you took the leaves out. What you have --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- in that tea is a collection of a tremendous number of alkaloids. And what the commentary is saying is that you would have to pull this alkaloid out. And that would be a chemical process. There's further -- there's further --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I guess I -- if I could just go back to the point. You're emphasizing that the Treaty doesn't cover the importation of plants. But you're not importing plants, you're --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- importing a mixture that must contain the covered hallucinogen or it doesn't have its effect.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. However, under the Treaty, it's not -- it's not covered by the Treaty, because it is not separate. If DMT were separated, then it would be covered by the Treaty. And, actually, if you look at the 1988 Treaty, going even farther, and its commentary, the commentary in the 1988 Treaty, which has to be read in connection with the 1971 Treaty, specifically defines preparation as the extraction --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So, under your --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- of the drug.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- theory, a marijuana tea would not be covered by the Treaty.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not by this Treaty. But that -- marijuana, coca leaves and poppies are specifically covered by the 1961 Treaty.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but they're not being imported, they're transformed into this tea. And you -- saying the active substance isn't there independently, so it's not covered. And that seems to me to be a -- an erroneous reading of the Treaty.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the difference, for example, with marijuana, is that if you look at the 1961 Treaty, it says "the plant, all parts of the plant, everything from the plant." It's all covered. What the 1971 Treaty did was different. And if you read the 1971 Treaty and the 1988 Treaty and their commentaries, if I can rely on their commentaries, and the International Narcotics Control Board, what they are expressing is a concern for the traditional religious and mystical use of plants in religion, and that's what they were concerned about, and that's why they didn't put this in, and that's why they specifically have, in the commentary, that the example of mimosa -- and they also have an example of peyote in the same paragraph 12, where they --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ About commentary or travaux, I don't mind using them for treaties, so long as they don't contradict the Treaty. Do we have any case where we use the -- les travaux preparatoires to actually contradict the language of the Treaty?
04-1084 +++$+++ 13280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not to my --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's what, it seems to me, is going on here.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor, it's not contradicting the Treaty, because the Government is taking this one sentence preparation, and the Government has a definition of it, for this litigation only, that is contrary to the definition in the Treaty the way it is interpreted by the travaux and by the commentary, and by this executive, which means that the executive's position here is really entitled to no deference; because, otherwise, the tea drunk by the Native American Church, the peyote tea, would also be covered.
