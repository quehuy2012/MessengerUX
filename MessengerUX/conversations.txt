02-1472 +++$+++ 4 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: These two contract cases concern whether the Government is liable in money damages under the Contract Disputes Act and section 110 of the Indian Self-Determination Act when the Secretary fails to fully pay a contract price for the --
02-1472 +++$+++ 5 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would you mind explaining to us how these two cases relate? The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit decision went one way and the Tenth Circuit went another. And are the claims at all overlapping? How are they differentiated?
02-1472 +++$+++ 6 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice O'Connor. They're -- they're not overlapping. The claims in the Federal Circuit case involved three contracts covering fiscal years 1994, 1995, and 1996. And the Cherokee contract at issue in the case that went through the Tenth Circuit is fiscal year 1997 contract and funding agreement. The section -- remedial section of the act, section 110 --
02-1472 +++$+++ 7 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But they're certainly at odds on the legal theory.
02-1472 +++$+++ 8 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, they are, Your Honor. The Federal Circuit applied standard, bedrock Government contracting law, primarily the rule that when a contract payment is conditioned on there being an appropriation, the payment right vests in full once the appropriation is enacted by Congress. And secondly, the court ruled that the Indian Self-Determination Act does not bar the payment of the contracts in this case under the circumstances presented. And to the contrary. We submit that the Secretary's construction of that clause would undo the act, would undo section 106(b) of the act --
02-1472 +++$+++ 9 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are the circumstances any different in the two situations, the Cherokee Nation case and the one in the Federal Circuit? Are -- are the circumstances, giving rise to the claim, different in any respect that could account for a difference in outcome?
02-1472 +++$+++ 10 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice O'Connor. There -- there is no difference in that respect, and there is an overlap in -- in this sense. The Shoshone-Paiute contract that arose through the Tenth Circuit case did involve fiscal year 1996, the same fiscal year as the Cherokee contract that covered fiscal year 1996. So in that sense, both cases involved the -- the same relevant issues. The -- the key, we think, to the resolution of the act is found in the act on page 12a of the appendix to our opening blue brief. The act was amended in this section twice, in 1988 and in 1994, for three reasons: to secure contract funding, to reduce the Federal bureaucracy, and to eliminate secretarial funding discretion over contract funding issues. In section 12a, 450j-1(a), the bottom half of the page, it is stated in subparagraph (1) that the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts entered into pursuant to this subchapter shall not be less than the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided. And then directly pertinent to this case is subparagraph (2), which directs -- which addresses contract support costs. There shall be added to the amount required by paragraph (1) contract support costs which shall consist of certain items. Incidentally, these items typically cover the cost of insurance, audit costs, procurement costs that might otherwise be administered for the Government by the Office of Personnel Management or personnel costs that might otherwise be administered by the Office of Personnel Management.
02-1472 +++$+++ 11 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does the -- do the actual contracts reduce the -- the CSC's to a dollar amount or --
02-1472 +++$+++ 12 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, they do.
02-1472 +++$+++ 13 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so we know -- they -- they knew at the moment the contract was signed what it was going to cost.
02-1472 +++$+++ 14 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct, Justice Souter. In the case of the Shoshone-Paiute contract, when the parties decided to renegotiate the contract amount, they entered into an amendment to specify the new, updated contract amount.
02-1472 +++$+++ 15 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't want to get ahead of you in taking us through the statute, so you can defer the question if -- if you choose. But it seems to me relevant to (a). Does -- is -- is part of the submission that the Government used some of the funds that otherwise would have gone to you for its own monitoring and -- of -- of health contracts and that that's what's in dispute? Or was it just general overhead for other programs it used?
02-1472 +++$+++ 16 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it is precisely, Justice Kennedy, what -- what you stated. In fact, we can turn directly to page 14a --
02-1472 +++$+++ 17 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I stated an or. I -- what I -- I stated at the outset?
02-1472 +++$+++ 18 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the Government took money for its own Federal functions instead of -- including contract monitoring --
02-1472 +++$+++ 19 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Including contract monitoring.
02-1472 +++$+++ 20 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Including contract monitoring. Including contract monitoring. In fact, they say so in their brief and -- and defend that action. The -- the sections on page 12a and 13a articulate in quite a lot of detail the nature of the contract support costs that must be added.
02-1472 +++$+++ 21 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ These are strange contracts, of course, aren't they? I mean, are there any other contracts that the Government has to enter into? I mean, the Secretary has to give these tribes the authority to take over, in effect, implementation of the -- of a Federal health program, doesn't he?
02-1472 +++$+++ 22 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct, Justice Scalia.
02-1472 +++$+++ 23 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- why would you expect that this strange kind of contract should -- should, prima facie, be governed by the same rules as to appropriations as other contracts --
02-1472 +++$+++ 24 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because --
02-1472 +++$+++ 25 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- where -- where an agency, having due regard to how much money is appropriated, will limit the number of contracts it enters into? But -- but here you're creating a situation where the agency has to contract and yet has no control over having enough money to -- to meet the contractual obligations. It seems to me a -- a strange way to run a railroad.
02-1472 +++$+++ 26 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it is a unique contractual situation, Justice Scalia, but one that Congress fully anticipated. And -- and I would explain it this way. First of all, there is the Contract Disputes Act which Congress said applies to these contracts. The contracts were so unique that prior to 1988, the Interior Board of Contract Appeals, in a decision called the Busby case, had ruled that these contracts could not be enforced under the Contract Disputes Act precisely for the reason Justice Scalia articulated. Congress changed that. In 1988, Congress amended section 110 of the act, reproduced at the bottom of page 26a, and gave the Court of Claims, then the Court of Claims, and the district courts concurrent jurisdiction over money damages claims under the Contract Disputes Act. And the legislative history explains that Congress did this precisely to overcome the Busby decision and to make these contracts enforceable for the stated contract price.
02-1472 +++$+++ 27 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But further to Justice Scalia's point, don't the contracts in question themselves contain clauses that say this is not a procurement contract?
02-1472 +++$+++ 28 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the procurement contract -- that is correct. Not the contracts themselves, Your Honor. The -- the act says that --
02-1472 +++$+++ 29 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, the act says that they're not procurement contracts.
02-1472 +++$+++ 30 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the contracts are not procurement contracts, Justice Kennedy. That's correct. These contracts began as procurement contracts. They had been procurement contracts, and even still, they were not enforced under the Court of -- the Interior Board of Contract Appeals decision in the Busby decision. Congress relieved the contractors of the procurement system because they felt that the agency had built up an enormous contract monitoring bureaucracy which it wanted to eliminate. And for that reason, it eliminated the procurement rules in the hopes that the contract monitoring bureaucracy would be eliminated along with it.
02-1472 +++$+++ 31 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Miller, do --
02-1472 +++$+++ 32 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg.
02-1472 +++$+++ 33 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- on -- on the interpretation you've just explained to us, does that mean that the Secretary has no authority under this statute or generally to reserve some portion of this for what you call Federal functions, that it -- every penny of the appropriation could go to the costs of this contract and nothing left in the till for the so-called Federal functions?
02-1472 +++$+++ 34 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I -- I would put my answer in this context. There are many sources from which the Government could have reprogrammed to pay these contracts. It could have been, yes, as we submit, from the funds spent on Federal functions and secretarial administration. It could have been from the up to $88 million increases Congress was making every year. It could have been from the up to $98 million in leftover appropriations the agencies had every year, and it could have been from the regional and headquarters offices that the agencies had where they don't administer services.
02-1472 +++$+++ 35 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But your -- your answer is, yes, if it came to that, they --
02-1472 +++$+++ 36 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the duty Congress imposed upon the Secretary. The Secretary was free not to reprogram. That's -- that's a choice the Secretary had and the Secretary made it. The question is what are the ramifications of that choice and we submit --
02-1472 +++$+++ 37 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, let me ask you another question related. Suppose -- this is an individual action. These are individual actions. They're not class actions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 38 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct, Your Honor.
02-1472 +++$+++ 39 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do the ones who come to court to sue get paid in full even though there may be many other self-determination contracts out there, and that if you gave them all their fair share, none of them would be paid in full? Does it just depend on first come to court, first served, and the less litigious are just out of luck?
02-1472 +++$+++ 40 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, we -- we do not believe that that -- that should be the outcome. That would advantage the contractors that came forward and not take account of the entire situation. We think the global situation has to be looked at. The total amount of the contracts that were not paid in fiscal year 1994 --
02-1472 +++$+++ 41 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, you can't get blood out of a turnip. I mean, Justice Ginsburg is asking the question, what if there is not enough money to go around?
02-1472 +++$+++ 42 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If there were only sufficient money to pay half of the contract shortfalls --
02-1472 +++$+++ 43 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
02-1472 +++$+++ 44 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- without violating the clause and the Secretary had the discretion not to reduce appropriations, or he could, for programs serving other tribes, and then the tribes would only be entitled to half of the shortfall, if there was only a sufficient amount of money.
02-1472 +++$+++ 45 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Didn't the tribes get notice they might not get the full amount of the -- the CSC, and so they had ample opportunity to cut back on their spending?
02-1472 +++$+++ 46 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Kennedy, and -- and to the contrary. In fiscal year 1994, the Indian Health Service was telling everybody they were paying them in full. They told the General Accounting Office they paid everybody in full on page 32 of the GAO report cited in the Government's brief. But --
02-1472 +++$+++ 47 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So these -- these are reliance damages in a sense.
02-1472 +++$+++ 48 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the tribes expected to be paid. The Shoshone-Paiute tribes were told they would be paid in full in the first year.
02-1472 +++$+++ 49 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, they -- they were out of pocket for money they spent before they knew, other than the statutory notice they had, that they wouldn't get the full amount?
02-1472 +++$+++ 50 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct. That is correct.
02-1472 +++$+++ 51 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, when do the tribal contractors know how much money the Government actually will have available to spend?
02-1472 +++$+++ 52 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The contractors don't know until the year is over because throughout the year, the Government reserves the power, although not exercised, but stated in a circular, to reprogram. And the appropriations --
02-1472 +++$+++ 53 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what do you mean by that? You said a second ago the Secretary had the option to reprogram. What do you mean by reprogram?
02-1472 +++$+++ 54 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ When the Secretary prepares a budget to the Congress, it states usually a lump sum amount of, say, $1.8 billion. We -- we take $400 million off the top or $300 million off the top because that was specified by Congress for certain purposes. But the balance is a lump sum. The Secretary crafts a budget. The budget is not adopted by Congress, just a dollar amount is adopted by Congress. Now, Congress can step in and take a particular item and earmark that item and cap it if it chooses, but it didn't do that in these years.
02-1472 +++$+++ 55 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but the -- the tribes have to enter contracts not knowing how much money is going to be there at the end of the day?
02-1472 +++$+++ 56 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The tribes enter into contracts, as most Government contractors do when they enter into contracts before an appropriation is made, not knowing if the agency will have the money to pay them. That's okay. The problem is when the statute says it's subject to the availability of appropriations and Congress enacts the appropriations. It's been the law for 120 years that at that point, the right to payment vests and the tribe is entitled to be paid.
02-1472 +++$+++ 57 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. So how was that appropriation money in fact used by the Federal Government, do you say?
02-1472 +++$+++ 58 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Federal Government --
02-1472 +++$+++ 59 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There was the appropriation.
02-1472 +++$+++ 60 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 61 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the tribes had already entered into contracts. Now, how was that lump sum used?
02-1472 +++$+++ 62 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The agency then, under this Court's teaching in Lincoln v. Vigil, has complete discretion over how it spends its appropriation except insofar as --
02-1472 +++$+++ 63 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that what you mean by programming?
02-1472 +++$+++ 64 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, thank you, Justice Souter, for taking me back to your question. What we mean is that the Secretary submits a budget, but the budget is not binding on the Secretary. It's not binding as a matter of law because Congress didn't adopt it. And as conditions change over the course of the year, the agency readjusts its budget, which we call reprogramming.
02-1472 +++$+++ 65 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So programming is allocating various segments of the lump sum to various purposes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 66 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct.
02-1472 +++$+++ 67 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
02-1472 +++$+++ 68 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the Secretary retains complete discretion as this Court taught --
02-1472 +++$+++ 69 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And is that done without regard to the contract amounts that the tribes have entered into?
02-1472 +++$+++ 70 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it should not be done without regard to the contract amounts --
02-1472 +++$+++ 71 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that in fact how it was done?
02-1472 +++$+++ 72 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is in fact how it was done.
02-1472 +++$+++ 73 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And is it still done that way?
02-1472 +++$+++ 74 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the times have changed. Since 1998, fiscal year 1998, Congress has imposed caps on the contracts and court costs that the agency has. So there's no question the agency cannot pay more than Congress gives it. When Congress only gives it $100 million or $200 million for contract support costs, that's it. The Secretary cannot be sued for failing to pay more.
02-1472 +++$+++ 75 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But didn't -- didn't Congress, even before that, impose a significant limitation on how much the Secretary could pay? What do you with the provision in -- in (b) of -- of the section that you were reading from? Notwithstanding any other provision in this subchapter, the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and the Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe or tribal organization under this chapter. I mean, what -- what money that the Secretary expends is -- is not expended for programs, projects, or activities that serve a tribe?
02-1472 +++$+++ 76 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, we read this -- this clause with -- keeping in mind the first sentence first of the sentence. The first sentence, which begins on the preceding page, page 14a, says that the amount of funds required by subsection (a), (1) shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract monitoring or administration by the Secretary. And the subparagraph (3) in the middle of page 15a, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 77 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's all very good, but --
02-1472 +++$+++ 78 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But then there's an exception.
02-1472 +++$+++ 79 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- then the last paragraph begins with the word notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter. So this --
02-1472 +++$+++ 80 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We --
02-1472 +++$+++ 81 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- it seems to me, overrides everything else. Unless -- unless you can persuade me that that -- that that provision doesn't give the Secretary the authority to -- to allocate the available funds among other activities that serve tribes, I -- I think it trumps whatever else you appeal to.
02-1472 +++$+++ 82 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, for -- for two reasons we think it cannot. First of all, if that exception swallowed up the rule set forth in the first sentence, it would defeat the whole purpose of the act. And more, in the statute on page 21, there is a mandatory rule of construction that Congress has articulated which, interestingly enough, the Government never cites in the statutory interpretation case. And this rule says on page 21, 1(a)(2), each provision of the act --
02-1472 +++$+++ 83 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wait.
02-1472 +++$+++ 84 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Page -- sorry --
02-1472 +++$+++ 85 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 21 of --
02-1472 +++$+++ 86 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 21a of our opening blue brief.
02-1472 +++$+++ 87 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, 21a, good.
02-1472 +++$+++ 88 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 21a, correct. Each provision of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act and each provision of this contract shall be liberally construed for the benefit of the contractor. That statement is repeated as well in every --
02-1472 +++$+++ 89 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, fine, but you still have to look at that last sentence in subsection (b) and grapple with what it means. The Secretary is not required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe to make funds available to another tribe.
02-1472 +++$+++ 90 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So what could it mean? That's our challenge.
02-1472 +++$+++ 91 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, what does it mean?
02-1472 +++$+++ 92 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We have to give it meaning. We believe it means the -- as the Secretary always said when -- and -- and said at the time these amendments were adopted in 1988, that's services on the ground, the hospitals and clinics. If I walked into the office of the headquarters of the Indian Health Service in Rockville, Maryland, I'm not going to see doctors and nurses in white jackets. I'm not going to see patients and counselors. There aren't programs serving tribes in these headquarters offices, and in these area offices, large portions of what they do are administrative functions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 93 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. May -- may I interrupt you there? And tell me if I understand the -- the position in your brief correctly. I thought the position that you took there was ultimately regardless of what the notwithstanding clause means, there's enough money to pay all the contracts in the appropriation that is actually made. And if any money is going to be squeezed, the person who's going to be squeezed or the -- is the -- is the agency itself. Its bureaucracy is going to have less money. And I understood your argument to be that given the provisions you read earlier in this section, Congress has made a positive decision that if there's a choice between paying the contract amounts and squeezing the bureaucracy, the bureaucracy gets squeezed. Is that your position?
02-1472 +++$+++ 94 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is our position.
02-1472 +++$+++ 95 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If that is your position, do you have to even grapple with difficulties about the notwithstanding clause?
02-1472 +++$+++ 96 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we still need to provide some meaning to the -- to the provision that says the Secretary may not -- does not have to reduce funding for programs serving other tribes. I guess, I think we do need to grapple with the clause in order not to --
02-1472 +++$+++ 97 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but I thought you were saying you could -- you could -- the -- the Secretary doesn't have to reduce funding for other tribes. The Secretary can pay the full contract costs, and if anybody is going to get the short end, it's going to be the bureaucracy.
02-1472 +++$+++ 98 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's going to be the bureaucracy.
02-1472 +++$+++ 99 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Just give them the -- just give them the money.
02-1472 +++$+++ 100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's not going to be the programs on the ground serving the tribes. It's going to be the bureaucracy.
02-1472 +++$+++ 101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
02-1472 +++$+++ 102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, it may be felt --
02-1472 +++$+++ 103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To put it -- this is a competition between two bureaucracies, the tribal bureaucracy that is administering the program and the Secretary's bureaucracy which is administering the program of programs. I mean, it's -- it's not as though it's a bureaucracy against the people. The whole purpose of this was to turn over the bureaucratic management of these programs from Government bureaucrats to tribal bureaucrats. I mean, it --
02-1472 +++$+++ 104 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I would -- I would --
02-1472 +++$+++ 105 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- you -- you paint it as though the -- you know, who cares about the bureaucrats. The -- the Government just wasn't interested in the bureaucrats. That may well be, but there -- there are bureaucrats at both ends of this thing.
02-1472 +++$+++ 106 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I say that for two reasons. First of all, the -- the Congress, in our opinion, clearly privileged the tribal contracts over the Secretary's Federal functions. But more practically, let's look at the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes. They took over a hospital that had a $5 million budget in round numbers, and the contract support costs requirement was $2 million. So the contract was in round numbers $7 million. So they get the hospital, $5 million to run it. They don't get the $2 million. Now, they have $3 million to run the hospital. It's not that they didn't get their bureaucracy. They didn't get the full hospital operational budget because they had to pay the fixed costs of carrying insurance, undertaking the audits required by Federal law. There were actual reductions in services so severe, in fact, that the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe nearly lost accreditation.
02-1472 +++$+++ 107 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can I ask you a basic question --
02-1472 +++$+++ 108 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Breyer.
02-1472 +++$+++ 109 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- which maybe others understand, but I'm confused. Imagine that this has nothing to do with Indians. It is simply an ordinary contract. Now, my understanding is that ordinary contracts say subject to appropriations. So we have to decide was there an appropriation. In our imaginary department of Government, the appropriation is $1 billion. Nothing is earmarked for anything. They enter into contracts that amount to $999 million. Now, they pay out $990 million, and their -- what the department says is, look, everybody knows we need at least $10 million to run our central bureaucracy. So there's no valid contract here. The appropriation wasn't made. Now, my understanding of ordinary Government contract law is to decide whether that $10 million was in principle available for the contracts. You look to something called the purpose-time-amount test. So was it during the same time? Yes. Is it in an appropriate amount? Yes. But is it available for this purpose? Ah, I'm not sure. All right. Now, I want -- if I have the -- the theory of it right, I want you to tell me what the money was in your case that is the equivalent of the $10 million in my example that you believe in principle was available to pay these -- for this Indian expenditure. Just pretend it's a regular contract. What is the equivalent of that $10 million?
02-1472 +++$+++ 110 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The equivalent of the $10 million would be sums not spent on anything --
02-1472 +++$+++ 111 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 112 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in this case, up to $100 million.
02-1472 +++$+++ 113 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, okay. And anything else?
02-1472 +++$+++ 114 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Any of the increases, any of the sums. And then we move to this statute --
02-1472 +++$+++ 115 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, forget this statute for a second because I'll stop you there. I want you to tell me why those sums -- I get the time. I get the amount.
02-1472 +++$+++ 116 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why the purpose.
02-1472 +++$+++ 117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Explain to me why it is one of the purposes for which those appropriations were made, i.e., the equivalent of the $10 million, to go pay for this.
02-1472 +++$+++ 118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's one of the things the -- the Government and we agree upon.
02-1472 +++$+++ 119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was one of the purposes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ One of the purposes was paying contracts, and that's because in this act, the appropriation says here's $1.4 billion or $1.8 billion to carry out the Indian Self-Determination Act. So that satisfies the purpose test.
02-1472 +++$+++ 121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. So you think -- you and the Government agree then that were this an ordinary contract case, there is no doubt that a legally binding contract would have been entered into and the clause, subject to appropriations, would not work for the Government.
02-1472 +++$+++ 122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct, Your Honor.
02-1472 +++$+++ 123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
02-1472 +++$+++ 124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you can't say that the Government agrees to that. You certainly agree to it.
02-1472 +++$+++ 125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. Were it an ordinary --
02-1472 +++$+++ 126 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Government --
02-1472 +++$+++ 127 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- were it an ordinary contract.
02-1472 +++$+++ 128 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In -- in the hypothetical. No. I think the Government would agree that the rule of Ferris and Blackhawk, the Dougherty rule from the Court of Claims, 1983, all stand for the proposition when you sign a contract with the Government and a lump sum appropriation comes, it's not your job to start monitoring Government operations and figuring out how much do they want to boost their functions for this or that or the other, and the --
02-1472 +++$+++ 129 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So our issue as far as you're concerned -- and I'll ask the Government the same question -- is, is this contract different from an ordinary contract because of A, B, C, D Indian reservations, et cetera? And your claim is, I can't find any difference. And their claim is there will be some difference. Is that right?
02-1472 +++$+++ 130 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct. They claim these aren't contracts -- Justice Kennedy.
02-1472 +++$+++ 131 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you did say the -- these contracts were unique.
02-1472 +++$+++ 132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ These contracts are unique. The contracts in Winstar were unique. The contracts in the United States v. New Mexico advance costs -- advance funded cost reimbursable contracts. Many contracts are unique. The question is whether the distinction makes a difference in the law. The distinction here that these are not procurement contracts, that can't be decisive.
02-1472 +++$+++ 133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the Government says it's unique because the tribes are providing governmental services. It doesn't really cite us a case where, say, a city or a subdivision has sued under a contract.
02-1472 +++$+++ 134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's not unique either because the -- the Government, the Department of Defense in Iraq contracts out governmental services, the provision of food to our troops in Iraq. That's a quintessential governmental services, feeding the military. But they contract it out. No one would suggest there that just because it's a governmental service, it qualifies that contract as a lesser contract than any other contract.
02-1472 +++$+++ 135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they didn't contract it out to the government of Iraq. They contracted it out to a private contractor. I mean, what -- what makes this unique is that the whole purpose of it was to give these -- these tribes more governmental power, more self-determination. The whole purpose was to enable the tribes to act as governments.
02-1472 +++$+++ 136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely. And even Congress considered --
02-1472 +++$+++ 137 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's -- that's what makes it different from private contracts --
02-1472 +++$+++ 138 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We --
02-1472 +++$+++ 139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- even -- even with Halliburton.
02-1472 +++$+++ 140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We --
02-1472 +++$+++ 141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, Halliburton is not an Indian tribe and doesn't purport to be governing anybody.
02-1472 +++$+++ 142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We submit that that difference was considered by Congress. In the 1988 amendments, there's even language that says, we're thinking about maybe calling this an intergovernmental agreement, but we've decided to call it a contract because we want it to be enforceable as a contract, just as other Government contracts for goods and services are enforced. And that was the language of the -- of the Senate report. They then imposed the Contract Disputes Act and provided a remedy in money damages. In those respects, along with the canon of construction, we believe that these contracts are fully enforceable for the stated contract amount. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, Justice Stevens.
02-1472 +++$+++ 143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. Mr. Srinivasan.
02-1472 +++$+++ 145 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Apart from the roughly 2 percent of the annual lump sum appropriation that the Secretary withheld for performance of those core agency functions that the agency itself was required to perform, the Secretary allocated the entire remaining 98 percent of its lump sum appropriation among tribes. Now, the tribes have to point to some source of funding within that lump sum appropriation.
02-1472 +++$+++ 146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they just did, the 2 percent. So my question to you is the same. I asked, let's imagine this had nothing to do with tribes, nothing to do with it. It was a typical, ordinary Government contract for pencils. All right? Or for soda water. Now, and everything were the same. Under those circumstances, just an ordinary contract -- and they point to that 2 percent and they say that is legally speaking -- we didn't expect you to pay it. We just won a lawsuit in the Court of Claims. But -- but we have -- we have a contract here. Okay? That's what we're just saying. The -- the subject to appropriation clause doesn't nix the contract because that 2 percent is available, legally speaking, time, purpose, and -- and amount. Okay? Classic. Now, what's the Government's view there?
02-1472 +++$+++ 147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
02-1472 +++$+++ 148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it available or not were this an ordinary contract?
02-1472 +++$+++ 149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. With respect to the 2 percent that's reserved for inherent Federal functions, that's not available.
02-1472 +++$+++ 150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm asking -- all right. Are -- is the Government's view then let's treat this just as an ordinary contract? Still it -- there was no money available.
02-1472 +++$+++ 151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With respect to --
02-1472 +++$+++ 152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Legally speaking under the time-purpose-amount test.
02-1472 +++$+++ 153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Breyer, I'm drawing a distinction between the 2 percent that's reserved for core agency functions and --
02-1472 +++$+++ 154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
02-1472 +++$+++ 155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- it's been a background principle of Government contracting law that there are certain core agency functions that -- that the Government is required to perform for itself and that it can't contract out. So I think that informs the interpretation of the subject to availability clause.
02-1472 +++$+++ 156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, I would like an answer to my question, yes or no. If this were an ordinary contract with a subject to appropriations clause, is -- would the Government be saying this is invalid because the appropriations were not there?
02-1472 +++$+++ 157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you have to look at the particular context.
02-1472 +++$+++ 158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There must be a yes or no answer to that.
02-1472 +++$+++ 159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It would be no if this statutory regime governed, Justice Breyer.
02-1472 +++$+++ 160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. What it is is a contract for pencils. Can you not -- is it impossible --
02-1472 +++$+++ 161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if all --
02-1472 +++$+++ 162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to make -- you see what I'm driving --
02-1472 +++$+++ 163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if all that's at issue is a standard subject to availability clause in a contract and there were no reduction clause, as there is in this statute, and you're dealing with the standard procurement context, then there is a Court of Claims decision, the Blackhawk decision, that suggests, albeit in a footnote, that in that situation, there are funds available in the sense that they're legally unrestricted.
02-1472 +++$+++ 164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct, and which are the funds that are -- that would be available here? Which are they?
02-1472 +++$+++ 165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There aren't any funds that are available here in our view because --
02-1472 +++$+++ 166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If this were under Blackhawk.
02-1472 +++$+++ 167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Under Blackhawk, it would be -- it would -- it would essentially affect the entire lump sum appropriation because there's no legal requirement that the lump sum appropriation be -- be directed in any particular manner. Now, there are some provisions in the --
02-1472 +++$+++ 168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That includes the 2 percent that you keep referring to.
02-1472 +++$+++ 169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- that would include in the -- that would include the 2 percent. But there are provisions, I should note parenthetically, in the appropriations act that say specifically, for example, that not to exceed a certain amount is to be used for a particular function or at least a certain amount is to be used, for example, for contract health services. So you'd have to take into account --
02-1472 +++$+++ 170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. Then let me do this then.
02-1472 +++$+++ 171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- those particular provisos.
02-1472 +++$+++ 172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You say if this were a classic, ordinary contract, the money would have been available legally speaking. Nobody says practically speaking, and they could have brought their lawsuit. Now, tell me specifically, if you can -- and this may take you the whole time. You want to make whatever argument you want. What is it that's special about this contract that brings it out of ordinary contracting principles?
02-1472 +++$+++ 173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, first and foremost, the text of the statute. If you look at page 15a of the appendix to -- to the tribes' briefs, this isn't your standard, garden variety subject to availability clause. You have to look at the particular context in which this statute --
02-1472 +++$+++ 174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the language is the same.
02-1472 +++$+++ 175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not, Justice O'Connor, with respect. It says, notwithstanding any other provision -- and I'm reading at the bottom of page 15a -- the provision of funds under this subchapter is subject to the availability of appropriations and -- and this is --
02-1472 +++$+++ 176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That phrase is the same, subject to the availability of appropriations.
02-1472 +++$+++ 177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That particular phrase resembles the one that Justice Breyer posited in his hypothetical.
02-1472 +++$+++ 178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Exactly.
02-1472 +++$+++ 179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the term available -- and I think this is critical. The term available is repeated in what's been referred to as the reduction clause, and I don't think one can understand what the term available means unless it considers the meaning of that term throughout that entire sentence.
02-1472 +++$+++ 180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but the other -- the other side says you don't have to get to that because you could have paid the contract amounts here without reducing funds available for other tribes. It's simply that it would have squeezed you in your budget, your -- your headquarters operating budget for IHS. So they say, if I understand them, that the -- that the nonreduction clause doesn't save you here because you could have paid it without reducing things for other tribes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I think that argument is incorrect. First of all, it's an incorrect interpretation of the terms of the reduction clause. But second of all, the notion that funds for inherent Federal functions, the 2 percent that the agency reserved to perform its core agency functions, were available for contracting is contrary to -- to the terms of the ISDA itself. And if you'll look at page 12a -- and I'm quoting from 450j-1(a)(1) -- what provision says is the amount of funds provided under the terms of self-determination contracts include the amount that the Secretary, quote, would have otherwise provided. And then later on down in the paragraph --
02-1472 +++$+++ 182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't see that. Where?
02-1472 +++$+++ 183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. It's --
02-1472 +++$+++ 184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not less. Right?
02-1472 +++$+++ 185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Shall not -- shall be not less than the amount that the appropriate Secretary would have otherwise provided. And then further down in the paragraph in the last -- in the last clause, including support of administrative functions that are otherwise contractable. And what otherwise contractable denotes is that there are certain functions that are not otherwise contractable, namely those core, inherent Federal functions that the agency itself is required to provide. And so what 450j-1(a) implements is the background understanding that funds for core agency functions don't have to be turned over to the contracting tribes because the agency requires those funds in order to continue essentially to exist as a Federal agency.
02-1472 +++$+++ 186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but I thought the submission of the petitioners' counsel was that some of these funds were used to monitor the contracts which are functions the tribes could have performed. So is there a factual disagreement here?
02-1472 +++$+++ 187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so, Justice Kennedy. I think it's more of a characterization disagreement. There -- it's true that in a descriptive sense, one might refer to some of these funds as used for contract monitoring, but what 450j-1(a) says is that whatever you might call it, the funds that are used for core agency functions are outside the funds to be -- to be turned over.
02-1472 +++$+++ 188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't say that. It doesn't say that. What it says is otherwise contractable. And they could certainly -- for a lay person like me in this, you'd think, well, we could have a provision that says $180,000 is hereby authorized to be spent only for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or Secretary of Interior. Well, if it said that, then that's not otherwise contractable because there's a statutory limit.
02-1472 +++$+++ 189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but --
02-1472 +++$+++ 190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So otherwise contractable sounds like a -- a statutory question.
02-1472 +++$+++ 191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it -- it's not talking about money that's otherwise contractable. It says, including supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable. It's talking about a limitation upon the contractability of functions --
02-1472 +++$+++ 192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct.
02-1472 +++$+++ 193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- not the use of funds.
02-1472 +++$+++ 194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's talking about both because the -- the first part of subparagraph (1) is the amount of funds. It's relating to the amount of funds that are required to be transferred, and what it stands for is that funds for supportive administrative functions that are not otherwise contractable, i.e., those core agency functions that the agency is required to perform itself, those funds aren't required to be turned over to contracting tribes. And that just reflects the common sense principle that the agency has to continue to exist to perform some core functions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But how do you -- how do you square that with the -- on page 14a -- reductions and, as Mr. Miller read to us, shall not be reduced to make funding available for contract managing -- monitoring or administration by the Secretary, shall not be reduced by the Secretary to pay for Federal functions, including but not limited to, and then a string of what I assume falls under the heading Federal functions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the way we square that under the statute is that the leading -- the initial sentence in subsection (b) says the amount of funds required by subsection (a) of this section. And our view of the statute is that funds for inherent Federal functions were never required to be transferred under subsection (a) to begin with. And so what (b) deals with is the funds that are left over after the funds for inherent Federal functions are taken off the top.
02-1472 +++$+++ 197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So are these noninherent Federal functions shall not be reduced to pay for Federal functions? So there's inherent Federal functions and noninherent?
02-1472 +++$+++ 198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, absolutely there are. The Federal functions is the broader set of -- it could essentially encompass everything the Federal Government does. Inherent Federal functions refers to that core set of functions that the agency itself is required to perform. And the distinction between inherent Federal functions and Federal functions, although it might seem trivial as a semantic matter, is reflected in fact in the definitions in title V of the ISDA where it specifically defines inherent Federal functions as a subset of Federal functions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does it ever define them as noncontractable? I mean, I -- I -- your answer, I suppose, is well, what -- what do you think they're talking about, but does it ever expressly get to --
02-1472 +++$+++ 200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it does.
02-1472 +++$+++ 201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the point of contractability?
02-1472 +++$+++ 202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does, Justice Scalia -- Justice Souter. Excuse me.
02-1472 +++$+++ 203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, but apologize to him. (Laughter.)
02-1472 +++$+++ 204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And we describe the -- the relevant provision in our brief, if you'll bear with me for just one second, on page 31. When Congress enacted the title IV self-governance provisions that relate to the BIA -- and this is at the beginning of the first partial paragraph that begins with of particular significance. There's a provision there, 25 U.S.C. 458cc(k). And the provision reads that nothing in this section is intended or shall be construed to expand or alter existing statutory authorities so as to authorize the Secretary to enter into any agreement with respect to functions that are inherently Federal. And I think what that signifies is that there are some functions that are not contractable and can't be turned over to the tribes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- that all may be true, of course. They're talking about don't contract out to the Indians something that should be done in Washington. But what has that got to do with the issue? We're talking, I thought, about -- about Government contracts. People who enter into Government contracts need certainty. They have to know whether that word, subject to appropriations, invalidates the contract or whether they have a valid contract. And a set of principles have come up that are used to decide that. And under that set of principles, money is available to pay for the contract if it's time, purpose, and amount. Okay? That's the principle. And --
02-1472 +++$+++ 206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You don't think --
02-1472 +++$+++ 207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and I don't see anything contrary to that.
02-1472 +++$+++ 208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, one background principle -- and it's reflected, by the way, in the terms of the contracts themselves. One background principle is that funds for inherent Federal functions are not required to be transferred to tribes. And the contracts --
02-1472 +++$+++ 209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Mr. Srinivasan, do you say that the contracts that were entered into by IHS and the tribes did somehow contract away Federal -- inherent Federal functions?
02-1472 +++$+++ 210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. They specifically --
02-1472 +++$+++ 211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They didn't violate that section, did they? The contracts that we're talking about.
02-1472 +++$+++ 212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They specifically did not transfer --
02-1472 +++$+++ 213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. So we're not dealing with that. We're dealing with contracts that didn't violate that section. And you're just saying that some of the lump sum appropriation was diverted by the Government to pay for some kind of core Federal function, not that the contracts violated that provision.
02-1472 +++$+++ 214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. The -- that's correct, Justice O'Connor. What I'm responding to is the suggestion that funds that were allocated by the Secretary to pay for inherent Federal functions were required to be diverted to pay for the indirect costs --
02-1472 +++$+++ 215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're not saying -- you're addressing not what was contracted out, but what funds are available.
02-1472 +++$+++ 216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct.
02-1472 +++$+++ 217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's where your argument is going.
02-1472 +++$+++ 218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct. It relates to the funds that are available. And the tribes' position --
02-1472 +++$+++ 219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you rely on the statement in (a) that the -- the only funds that are available are funds that include funds to -- to pay for supportive administrative functions that are otherwise contractable.
02-1472 +++$+++ 220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. Not funds --
02-1472 +++$+++ 221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And not funds that are used to pay for administrative functions that are not contractable.
02-1472 +++$+++ 222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. We think that funds for inherent Federal functions were taken off -- off the --
02-1472 +++$+++ 223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I --
02-1472 +++$+++ 224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You said that --
02-1472 +++$+++ 225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I ask you sort of a basic question that I'm having trouble following? As I understand, you're saying 98 percent of the appropriation have been allocated to programs, projects, activities, and so forth that can't be reduced. Now, is there anything in the statute that would have prevented the Secretary from allocating only 96 percent of the budget to those funds?
02-1472 +++$+++ 226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there is, Justice Stevens, in the following sense. It's not at all the case that the Secretary had unfettered discretion in composing the allocation scheme in any fiscal year.
02-1472 +++$+++ 227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But his budget that he actually worked out with the 98 percent was not mandated by the statute, as I understand.
02-1472 +++$+++ 228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In -- in part it was mandated by the statute.
02-1472 +++$+++ 229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In part but not in whole.
02-1472 +++$+++ 230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Perhaps not in whole --
02-1472 +++$+++ 231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's the point.
02-1472 +++$+++ 232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- but at least in significant part. And let me -- but I think this is significant, and if I can just walk the Court through the process by which the budget is developed and any appropriation ultimately is allocated. The Secretary has always, both before the ISDA and after the ISDA, taken the current year's allocation across programs as a given, as a baseline from which the next year's allocation will be built. And that's reflected in the terms of the statute on pages 14a to 15a of the appendix to the blue brief. There's a provision, 450j-1(b)(2), that says that the amount that's transferred to contractors shall not be reduced by the Secretary in subsequent years except pursuant to certain limited criteria and one of which, the principal one of which, is the reduction in appropriations. But we're not dealing with that in the relevant fiscal years. There was always an increase. And so the Secretary, pursuant to the statute, kept the funding for across programs at least at the level that it was at the previous fiscal year. Now, in addition to that, the Secretary builds two -- two considerations on top. The first is mandatory across-the-board increases for things such as salary COLA's and inflationary adjustments. And that's a standard feature of budgeting, and it's reflected again in the terms of the statute. And that -- I'd point the Court to page 9 of the Government's brief, the gray brief, where we cite a provision, 25 U.S.C. 1680a.
02-1472 +++$+++ 233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is the -- is the nub of what you're trying to tell me is that the 98 percent was, in fact, mandated by a statute?
02-1472 +++$+++ 234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was -- I -- I think in principal part it was mandated by the -- by --
02-1472 +++$+++ 235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Principal part, but --
02-1472 +++$+++ 236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let --
02-1472 +++$+++ 237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does that mean that there was not enough?
02-1472 +++$+++ 238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ At least as far --
02-1472 +++$+++ 239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They could have made it 97 percent --
02-1472 +++$+++ 240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- insofar as what I've said with respect --
02-1472 +++$+++ 241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and had enough money --
02-1472 +++$+++ 242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sorry.
02-1472 +++$+++ 243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to pay these contract obligations.
02-1472 +++$+++ 244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Justice Stevens.
02-1472 +++$+++ 245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ See, the thing that troubles me is it seems to me your reading of the statute makes the contractual problem -- provision illusory because they can always allocate funds to all these other projects and say, well, we've already used up the money.
02-1472 +++$+++ 246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I don't think that they have discretion to do that. And that's what I'm trying to explain. At least with respect to the existing baseline and a mandatory across-the-board increases, it's mandated by the statute that the -- that the Secretary conduct his budgeting allocation process in the way that he's done. With respect to the mandatory across-the-board increases, on page 9 of the Government's brief, 25 U.S.C. 1680a, a provision that relates specifically to the administration of the Self-Determination Act, it requires the Secretary to provide funds to contracting tribes for, quote, cost-of-living increases, closed quote, and, quote, other expenses relating to the provision of health services, closed quote, on the, quote, same basis as such funds are provided to programs and services operated directly. In other words, with respect to mandatory across-the-board increases, the Secretary has to allocate those proportionately amongst contracting tribes and non-contracting tribes. And that leaves the additional set of an increase from one year to the next year that deals with specific targeted items, and principally that would include, for example, staffing of new facilities that come on board during the course of a particular fiscal year. And with respect to those specific targeted items, the critical point is that the contracting tribes often benefit from the addition of those and from the enforcement by the Secretary of those sorts of earmarks. For example, in this particular case, the -- one of the facilities that's at issue is the Stillwell clinic in Oklahoma. That was a new facility that came on board in the early 1990s and for which the -- for which the Cherokee Nation assumed administration of it through a self-determination agreement. Now, the staffing for that facility was specifically earmarked in the Secretary's budget submissions and in -- in Congress' appropriation committee reports. And it, of course, is in the Cherokee Nation's interest to ensure that those earmarks are honored.
02-1472 +++$+++ 247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are you telling me that the committee reports are -- are binding law?
02-1472 +++$+++ 248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're not binding law, Justice Stevens. We fully recognize that. But at the same time, I don't think that what Congress intended to do was to require the Secretary to completely ignore the committee reports.
02-1472 +++$+++ 249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. But you got a conflict apparently between the committee reports and what seems to be pretty clear law, which says we're going to treat these contracts as contracts, not as intergovernmental agreements. And in -- in that conflict, I don't see why contracting principles don't trump the committee reports.
02-1472 +++$+++ 250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not just the committee reports, Justice Souter. It's the reduction clause. The reduction clause is a part of the statute and no one has ever suggested the reduction clause doesn't inform the proper interpretation of the contract.
02-1472 +++$+++ 251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and their -- their argument is that you can pay the contract amount without robbing other tribes of the amounts that the -- that the nonreduction clause refers to. They are saying -- I think they're saying, look, you, the governmental bureaucracy, get squeezed. Yes. And if so, the contract comes first and you have to live with the squeeze and go back to Congress and say, we're doing what you told us and we're getting squeezed out of existence. I think that's what they're saying.
02-1472 +++$+++ 252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is what they're saying, Justice Souter, but with respect to, I think it's incorrect. The Government bureaucracy consists of two separate types of bureaucracy. There's that core bureaucracy that is the inherent Federal functions. And one of their arguments is that the Secretary was required to divest himself of the funds that were necessary to perform those functions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, he's not. But if -- if -- where I'm really coming from, to be honest -- and I'd like -- you might as well reply to what I'm actually -- is why I'm asking these slightly hostile questions. (Laughter.)
02-1472 +++$+++ 254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I read here -- look, the question really is was this money like the bureaucracy money. Is it legally speaking an appropriation available, not practically speaking but legally? And here it seems to me, in looking through this somewhat quickly, that you say no, but the Board of Contract Appeals say yes. And so I think in my mind, you know, one group of people who really know about this is the Board of Contract Appeals. So if they're saying that money from a contract point -- a point of normal contract law is legally available, I promise you I'm predisposed to think they're right. So I might as well expose that to you so you can tell me now why I'm wrong or they're wrong or whatever.
02-1472 +++$+++ 255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because, Justice Breyer, I think the core of it is that even if you think that they're right, that these funds are legally available, that's not enough under the ISDA because the ISDA specifically reserves to the Secretary the discretion that he not be required to reduce funding for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in order to make funds available to another tribe under this subchapter.
02-1472 +++$+++ 256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there is -- is -- the kind -- the money that's available to one tribe can't be taken for the other. But I thought the Board of Contract Appeals was saying taking that into account, there's still enough money left over. Am I wrong about that? I thought you should take money from one tribe to give it to another. What did they think?
02-1472 +++$+++ 257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. They thought -- the -- the board -- the Federal Circuit at least, which echoed the Board of Contract Appeals, thought --
02-1472 +++$+++ 258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm thinking the Board of Contract Appeals and the Federal Circuit.
02-1472 +++$+++ 259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think the Board of -- of Contract Appeals really wrestled directly with where the funds were coming from. They just thought that legal availability would be sufficient. Now, what the Federal Circuit said was that funds for inherent Federal functions are available. And we think that's wrong for the reasons I've said. I don't think those funds ever came into the group of funds that were subject to be transferred to begin with. But even if you thought that they did, I think it's clear that funds for inherent Federal functions are funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe in the sense that one example of a core Federal function --
02-1472 +++$+++ 260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but if that's true, then everything -- then every penny in the -- in the IHS bureaucracy qualifies. I mean, that swallows the -- that swallows the entire budget.
02-1472 +++$+++ 261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let's -- Justice Souter, if I -- if I could, let's look at the particular sources --
02-1472 +++$+++ 262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. But I mean, just conceptually isn't that -- isn't that the -- the implication of what you're saying?
02-1472 +++$+++ 263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- you can't limit it to inherent Government functions. Both the inherent and the noninherent Government functions would fall within this provision --
02-1472 +++$+++ 264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- if you read it as broadly as you've just read it.
02-1472 +++$+++ 266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I guess the way I'd like to make the point is to say that the sources of funds that they point to, which include inherent Federal functions and the -- the noninherent Federal function bureaucracy that supports the administration of programs that serve tribes that are directly served by the Federal Government, those two are in fact programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe. With respect to the administrative support --
02-1472 +++$+++ 267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ On -- on that point -- on that point, in the Federal Circuit Judge Dyke expressed considerable displeasure with the Government because he said three times I said, tell me what existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced if these contract support costs are paid in full. And he said, I asked them again and again and again, and they were unresponsive. So since the Government declined to tell the court what programs -- existing programs with other tribes would have been reduced, mustn't we assume, as I think the Federal Circuit did, that the proof is unavailable and no existing program with other tribes would have been diminished?
02-1472 +++$+++ 268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't -- I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg. I mean, one straightforward reason why you don't have to take that assumption is that it's not only the Federal Circuit case that's before the Court, it's also the Tenth Circuit case. And there's -- there are declarations in the Tenth Circuit case that specifically assert that diverting funding for -- to pay for the contract support costs of these tribes would have required reducing funds for programs, projects, or activities serving a tribe.
02-1472 +++$+++ 269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, what does that mean?
02-1472 +++$+++ 270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So --
02-1472 +++$+++ 271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, one thing is existing contracts, things that are already ongoing, and then another thing is, well, we think that there's a new program that could be good for some tribe. So we're going to put that new program in and say that that steps in front of these contract support costs. Are we talking just about existing programs that -- that the Government has made a commitment to, or are we saying the Government is at liberty to benefit tribes? And so what if the contract support costs are, as a result, diminished? We're still doing good for tribes.
02-1472 +++$+++ 272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We're talking about both existing programs and new programs, and with respect to new programs, there's -- it's every bit as likely that those new programs would benefit contracting tribes as noncontracting tribes. And again, one of the new facilities --
02-1472 +++$+++ 273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's strange to talk of reducing -- is -- is not required to reduce funding for a new program. I mean, for a new program, there isn't any funding. How can you reduce the funding for a new program?
02-1472 +++$+++ 274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because --
02-1472 +++$+++ 275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That provision makes sense with regard to existing programs, but it doesn't make any sense with regard to proposed programs.
02-1472 +++$+++ 276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think that reduce necessarily takes the existing year's appropriation as the baseline. We think that what it takes as the baseline is the current year's appropriation allocation which takes into account increases. And one way to see that is 25 U.S.C. 1680a, which is the provision that I cited earlier that requires the Secretary to apportion mandatory across-the-board increases on a proportionate basis as between contracted programs and noncontracted programs. And what that provision means is that the reduction takes into account those mandatory across-the-board increases from year to year. So in some sense, I think reduce does mean this year's allocation of appropriations as opposed to last year's spending amount.
02-1472 +++$+++ 277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Srinivasan, you -- you alluded a moment ago in -- in answering Justice Ginsburg, I guess, to declarations on file on the Tenth Circuit case that -- that specifically said we would have to reduce funds available for other programs. Did those declarations get specific in the way that her original question was -- was asking about? Did it say -- did the declarations say we will have to reduce the X program for the Navajo Tribe and the Y program for the Apache Tribe and so on, or was it -- did the declarations simply say, as a general matter, we would have to reduce allocations for other tribes?
02-1472 +++$+++ 278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they -- they make the point as a general matter, and they also give an example. I think the one example that they give -- and maybe there are more -- is -- is a diabetes program. But I think it's more the general principle --
02-1472 +++$+++ 279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was that a new program or an existing program?
02-1472 +++$+++ 280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's an -- the -- the particular example is an existing program. But I think it's more --
02-1472 +++$+++ 281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me you can interpret those comments as saying we don't -- they did not leave enough room in the budget for the programs we now want to support and our prior contractual obligations.
02-1472 +++$+++ 282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're -- you're speaking with particular respect to the new programs, Justice Stevens?
02-1472 +++$+++ 283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. It seems to me that you can interpret what you're saying as the -- as the -- the Government adopting a budget in which there's not enough room for all the programs it wants to support in the current year and continuing to honor the obligations under the existing contracts.
02-1472 +++$+++ 284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think that even with respect to the current year there wouldn't be enough money to pay for the complete shortfall in contract support costs. If you look at the figures, the shortfall in contract support costs, for example, in 1997 cumulatively was $82 million, and that's -- that is more than the amount of the appropriation increase from FY 1996 to FY 1997. It's more than the amount that was reserved by the Government for inherent Federal functions. And so even if you accepted that interpretation, it wouldn't be sufficient to fully fund the contract support costs.
02-1472 +++$+++ 285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there some way to avoid these problems now? Has anything changed?
02-1472 +++$+++ 286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice O'Connor, Congress changed things by imposing a statutory cap, explicit statutory cap, on contract support cost funding beginning with 1998. It had done so since 1994 for the BIA and it did so beginning in 1998 with respect to IHS.
02-1472 +++$+++ 287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why was there that difference between the BIA that got the statutory caps earlier and not till, was it, 4 years later for the IHS?
02-1472 +++$+++ 288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the difference lies in the extent to which there was perceived to be a shortfall. My understanding is that there was a shortfall already in BIA programs whereas the shortfall didn't really become evident with respect to the IHS until 1994 and beyond. And that's why you might see the discrepancy between the two. But Congress also acted, by the way, in 1998 in the 1999 Appropriations Act in enacting section 314 of the 1999 Appropriations Act. And I think, if nothing else, section 314 at list -- at least expresses the view of a subsequent Congress that the Secretary's allocation scheme from 1994 to 1997 was legitimate and was fully within his discretion under the ISDA. And under this Court's decisions in Red Lion and its progeny, that determination by a subsequent Congress is at least entitled to great weight in determining what the Secretary appropriately exercised discretion in 1994 through 1997. So even if you thought that there was some doubt on whether the Secretary had carried out his functions consistently with the ISDA, I think Congress' saying later in the 1999 Appropriation Act that its view was that Secretary had done so legitimately should push the Court towards ruling in our favor on the initial interpretation of the ISDA. I want to address really quickly, if I could, the notion that the funds for administrative support for programs that are administered directly by the Federal Government are available. And that would have significant consequences because one of the policies underlying the act is not only to protect the interests of tribes that are currently entered into self-determination contracts, but it's to protect the amounts that are available to tribes that might some day choose to enter into self-determination contracts. And if, under the tribes' view, the Secretary was required to divert the entire amount of the increase in any particular year to contracting tribes or to -- to divert the entire amount of administrative support for -- for noncontracted programs to contracting tribes, the effect of that would be to freeze in place the amounts that were available for potentially contracting tribes in future years. Thank you.
02-1472 +++$+++ 289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Miller, you have about 4 minutes left.
02-1472 +++$+++ 291 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, thank you. First, I'd like to address the availability of appropriations clause briefly. That is a term of art with a well-established meaning. This Court in Morissette said that if -- unless there's a contrary direction from Congress that the term of art should not be given its well-established meaning, it controls. And that is the meaning, purpose, time, and amount, that the appropriation is available for the purpose during the time and in the amounts necessary to fully --
02-1472 +++$+++ 292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think they disagree with you about the purpose in respect to the core Government function.
02-1472 +++$+++ 293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Secondly, with regard to the core governmental functions, in Blackhawk, the contractor had a settlement with the Veterans Administration. The Veterans Administration had to reprogram. From where? We don't know, but the Veterans Administration had to reprogram and wanted to get approval from the Congress for that reprogramming action. Congress then stepped in but after the payment was due and forbade any reprogramming, and the Court then held when the payment was due, money was legally available and it doesn't matter where it comes from. There is no protection for inherent Federal functions. It may have come from some other hospital budget. It may have come from some other activity of the Veterans Administration. No doubt everything the VA does is important, but it doesn't mean it didn't have a legal obligation to pay the contract. There is no rule that has an IFF exception to the governmental duty to pay, and if there was, it would upset Government contract law deeply as the amicus brief from the National Chamber explains. Secondly, when funds are not available, we know what happens. This Court's decision, Justice Brandeis' decision for the Court, in Sutton explains what happens when funds are not available. There was a line item appropriation of $20,000 for a construction project. We understand that the contractor was on notice. Everything is square. Here, the entire lump sum appropriation was available, and I'd like to give the Court a sense of where the money could have come from, not that the Government had to do it. Just as in Blackhawk, if they chose not to reprogram, that's their right. But then there's a remedy. Where could the money have come from? In 1994, there was slightly under $2 million in a shortfall, just to the Cherokee contractor. No other contractor was apparently shorted. There was up to $98 million in leftover appropriations that year. There was 55 -- $88 million in an increase, up to $88 million in increase every year from $36 million to $88 million. There was $25 million in inherent Federal functions. They couldn't have shaved that by 10 percent to pay this contractor? Not that they had to. They could have taken some of it from there, some of it from the leftover, some of it from the increase, some of it from the offices at headquarters and area offices. That was their decision. But the contractor didn't take the risk that the Secretary would say, at the end of the day, I've decided to allocate 100 percent of my money this way, and by golly, there's nothing left for you. No contractor takes that risk in dealing with the Government, and surely, a tribal contractor with a mandatory contract set forth in the statute doesn't take that risk either. There is no limitation to the Secretary's theory in this case. The Secretary's theory means that we come, the contractors come, after the allocation of the Secretary. Well, the Secretary could, in a reduction year, decide to allocate the entire reduction to the contracts and enhance even his own Federal bureaucracy and programs serving other tribes and say, now I've made my decision and I've made my judgment. I don't have enough money to pay you. There's no limit here on contract support costs. It could be the secretarial amount. They could zero out these contracts and say it's practical availability. And we've decided there isn't enough money to deal with all of the health care needs in the country, so we're going to deal with the ones we operate and you come last. Now, that's not what the -- that's not what the statute permits. That sort of interpretation would lead to an absurdity. With regard to the Tenth Circuit decision, Justice, you asked a question about the declarations in the Tenth Circuit. There was a declaration in the Tenth Circuit, but all it had was a conclusory statement, to have reprogrammed anything would have caused reductions in programs serving other tribes. Now, that is not sufficient proof to withstand summary judgment, and it's certainly not sufficient proof to establish summary judgment. So for all these reasons, we believe the Tenth Circuit decision should be reversed and the Federal Circuit decision affirmed. Unless the Court has more questions.
02-1472 +++$+++ 294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Miller.
02-1472 +++$+++ 295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILLER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens.
02-1672 +++$+++ 299 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument in Jackson against the Birmingham Board of Education. Mr. Dellinger.
02-1672 +++$+++ 301 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Under the decision below, title IX stands alone as the only major civil rights statute that would permit retaliation against those who complain that the law is being violated. There are at least a half a dozen anti-discrimination laws that do not contain a separate retaliation provision, and every one of them has been found to prohibit retaliation as one kind of discrimination. There's a reason for that. Anti-discrimination laws simply can't be effective if threats of retaliation are allowed to chill those who would seek to bring their institutions into compliance.
02-1672 +++$+++ 302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, the question is whether -- that -- that may be true, but there would be an administrative remedy. The question here is a private cause of action for damages.
02-1672 +++$+++ 303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is true, Justice Kennedy.
02-1672 +++$+++ 304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Even -- even assuming the -- the validity of your premise, you still have another step.
02-1672 +++$+++ 305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand that other step, and I think that was largely resolved in Cannon v. the City of Chicago, a decision which this Court upheld a right of action to enforce title IX, even though there was also administrative remedies available and which was validated by Congress, as this Court -- every member of this Court recognized in -- in Sandoval.
02-1672 +++$+++ 306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought -- I thought that Cannon -- we've -- we've allowed Cannon to stay on the books, but I thought we have sworn off the kind of creation of -- of implied remedies that Cannon exemplifies.
02-1672 +++$+++ 307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In this case, there is no doubt that the two established principles together that are settled support this cause of action. The first is that there is a cause of action to enforce title IX. That's Cannon through Congress, through Sandoval, through -- your opinion in Sandoval acknowledges that Cannon is solid law and, the second point, that the statute itself is violated. Title IX is violated by retaliatory action against Coach Jackson. He's -- and -- and this is an important part of title IX because, particularly here, people like Coach Jackson need to come forward because students are often minors. They're not in the best position to know the budgets. It is people like Coach Jackson who make it work, and indeed, I think what is recognized about the -- about the cause of action for retaliation is that it is very important to enable people to bring their institutions into compliance without resorting to litigation.
02-1672 +++$+++ 308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's very -- it's very useful, I'm sure, but it -- it could be very disruptive also, I am sure. If I were -- if I were a coach, one of the first things -- especially a coach of a women's team in high school, one of the first things I would do would be to complain about not -- not getting enough facilities. This would make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether -- whether I'm a lousy coach or not. You -- you would have to think twice before you fire me because I would have a retaliation claim.
02-1672 +++$+++ 309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, the burden, of course, is on the plaintiff to demonstrate causation. And you should take great comfort from the fact, the Court can take great comfort from the fact that retaliation has been established as a violation of all of the major civil rights statutes, going back to 30 years to title VI --
02-1672 +++$+++ 310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Some of them specifically provide for retaliation, don't they?
02-1672 +++$+++ 311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct.
02-1672 +++$+++ 312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why do they do that if, as you assert, the mere word discrimination embraces it?
02-1672 +++$+++ 313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Congress has taken a different approach. In some cases, there would be a textual problem. Title VII, for example, speaks of discrimination based on such individual's race or national origin. Title -- and -- and therefore, it might need a specific retaliation provision. Title IX speaks upon -- about discrimination on the basis of sex. And here I think to -- to allay your concern about the coach, we have had -- title IX's retaliation provision has been the established law. It was the law at the time Congress -- it was understood, at the time Congress enacted title IX, that the identical wording of title VI had been construed by the administrative agency to include a cause of action for retaliation. Congress enacted title IX against the background of the Sullivan decision, which had recognized that discrimination can include retaliation. So that it comes as no surprise that every court of appeals that has addressed this issue has found that there's retaliation under title IX. In over 30 years, there -- at most we can find 140 reported cases in the Federal system where there is a claim for retaliation under title IX, and under title IX and all of the other discrimination provisions, courts have found it perfectly satisfactory to work out the causation requirements and -- in -- in dealing with retaliation cases. Now, here, what the respondent did is they discharged the coach who was seeking equal treatment for girls. When it singled Coach Jackson out for adverse treatment, it was discriminating, and when it did so, because he was seeking equal treatment for girls, it was discriminating on the basis of sex.
02-1672 +++$+++ 314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think that it -- it is a reasonable description of what happened -- he was fired for complaining about his girls' team not getting enough facilities -- that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded from participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under an education program?
02-1672 +++$+++ 315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
02-1672 +++$+++ 316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think that -- that remotely describes what happened to this coach?
02-1672 +++$+++ 317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely. First of all, the -- the court of appeals correctly says -- in the petition appendix at 3a, the court of appeals says we assume for the purposes of this appeal that the board retaliated against Jackson for complaining about perceived title IX violations. But for the discrimination on the basis of sex, he would not have complained, and he not -- had he not made a complaint about sex discrimination, he wouldn't have lost his position. He is denied the benefit of coaching in the program. He's denied the ability to participate in this federally funded program as a coach, and he is discriminated against by being singled out for retaliation. And this is not a case in which -- that has concern -- I mean, Justice Kennedy raised the question about this being a funding case, and I understand the special sensitivity that the Court has about rules that are based upon spending requirements where you want to be sure that States understand what they're agreeing to when they accept the Federal funds. This is not a case in which it could not have been anticipated when those funds were accepted. At that time, at the time these funds were accepted, which would have been about 1999 or 2000, title IX's ban on sex discrimination was itself, of course, universally known. Retaliation was understood to be part and parcel of that. We had had 30 years where both the Department of Education and --
02-1672 +++$+++ 318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but that's again the question of the substantive scope of the provision, and that's different from whether there was a congressional intent to create a private cause of action for this sort of violation. And was it -- Virginia Bankshares and so forth tells us that this is not the heyday of prior cause of actions anymore. You have to show that there's a congressional intent in the Spending Clause to create a private cause of action for damages.
02-1672 +++$+++ 319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think the Court --
02-1672 +++$+++ 320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that's -- that's quite separate from --
02-1672 +++$+++ 321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. I -- I --
02-1672 +++$+++ 322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- from this -- from the question of substantive liability.
02-1672 +++$+++ 323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand that. Here, first of all, when Congress acted, unlike the earlier time when it passed title VI, when Congress passed title IX, it was a background in the law from Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park that -- that retaliation was considered a part of discrimination. The title VI regulations were themselves well known based on identical language, virtually verbatim language. It provided for retaliation. And moreover, this Court as recently as the Davis case, Franklin and Davis, and in the North Haven case has found that employment discrimination, sexual harassment by teachers and peer-on-peer sexual harassment all come within title IX and have, therefore, agreed that Cannon v. the City of -- v. the University of Chicago creates that cause of action. Now, this case is actually a lot easier than Davis, even taking into account the concerns that -- that you and other Justices expressed there, because this is not a case where liability is being imposed, you know, for the acts of third parties like students over whom you may have limited control. This is deliberately undertaken actions by the responsible officials acting intentionally. It's not a novel concept the way one could argue that peer-on-peer sexual harassment was as a part of discrimination. But it's been accepted for more than 30 years by the responsible Federal agency.
02-1672 +++$+++ 324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but it's separate enough from discrimination that in other statutes, although Congress does create a cause of action for discrimination, it goes out of its way to create a separate cause of action for retaliation. It's sufficiently separate, and if it is that sufficiently separate, it doesn't seem to me that you could clearly say that -- that when the State signed on to receiving Federal funds under title IX, they should have known that this door to litigation was being opened to them. Yes, litigation for -- for discrimination against -- against female athletes, but not -- not discrimination suits alleging retaliation. That's a whole, new area.
02-1672 +++$+++ 325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, with -- with all due respect, I don't think there's any way, when the district accepted these funds, that they could have reasonably relied on the assumption that they would be free to retaliate against people who tried to comply --
02-1672 +++$+++ 326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but there was -- there was -- let's go back to this for just a moment -- an administrative remedy available for retaliation expressly under the regs?
02-1672 +++$+++ 327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct.
02-1672 +++$+++ 328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And did this petitioner seek an administrative remedy at all?
02-1672 +++$+++ 329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He did not seek an administrative remedy. He went through the school system itself at every level. He went through five different levels, following the chain of command.
02-1672 +++$+++ 330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What would the administrative remedy have allowed here --
02-1672 +++$+++ 331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
02-1672 +++$+++ 332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- had it been sought?
02-1672 +++$+++ 333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Here, as in Franklin, as in Davis, as in Cannon v. the University of Chicago, as in every one of this Court's title IX cases, indeed, as in all of its title VI cases involving Federal funds with race, you can call this to attention to the office of civil rights of the relevant agency and they can begin an inquiry. Ultimately they have the authority of the draconian sanction of cutting off the funds to the --
02-1672 +++$+++ 334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do they have any other sanction? Because the notion of an administrative remedy ordinarily would be a remedy for the individual who's complaining. But as I understand it, this administrative process, this detailed administrative process, leads only to one sanction, the one you have described as draconian.
02-1672 +++$+++ 335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct.
02-1672 +++$+++ 336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that's it. It would not have permitted a restoration of the job to the --

02-1672 +++$+++ 339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is not part of the -- the administrative process is only about institutional funding, which is why the Court has consistently upheld the right to bring these actions for what are violations of the statute itself.
02-1672 +++$+++ 340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if we don't accept -- let's assume, just for the sake of argument, that -- that we're having trouble accepting the -- the analysis that it is a violation of the statute in the statute's own terms. You then made the argument that, in fact, you should recognize retaliation as a claim because in the context of -- of school students and so on, if you don't allow retaliation, the teachers are not going to blow the whistle, and if the teachers blow the whistle, the statute is going to be a dead letter.
02-1672 +++$+++ 341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is --
02-1672 +++$+++ 342 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so the -- the argument is you -- you should recognize this as a necessity. That, it seems to me, still goes back to Justice O'Connor's question. Why do we have to recognize a private cause of action as opposed to the government allowing an administrative remedy? And I thought you were leading up to saying the administrative remedy simply isn't effective because it's so draconian that, in fact, they don't impose it, or for some other reason. So my question is, is there an argument to say that the administrative remedy simply is not good enough to preclude -- to -- to deter retaliation and that's why you've got to have a private cause of action?
02-1672 +++$+++ 343 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that is absolutely right.
02-1672 +++$+++ 344 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What's -- what are the facts? What's the empirical evidence for that?

02-1672 +++$+++ 346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you know if administrative sanctions have been imposed under title IX against schools?
02-1672 +++$+++ 347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR.

02-1672 +++$+++ 358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It seems to me it's -- it's overwhelmingly effective. You tell the school you either rehire the coach or we're cutting off your money.
02-1672 +++$+++ 359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice --
02-1672 +++$+++ 360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it hard to decide what they're going to do?
02-1672 +++$+++ 361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I do have an answer, first, for Justice Ginsburg's question from Ms. Greensberger. The sanction has never been imposed under title IX of cutting off funds. And it --
02-1672 +++$+++ 362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I can't imagine anyone who would want such a sanction. Which doesn't help --
02-1672 +++$+++ 363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is certainly not what --
02-1672 +++$+++ 364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the girls on the team.
02-1672 +++$+++ 365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- Coach -- Coach Jackson would have sought, and -- and because that process is not one that's responsive to the individual case -- if you're down in Birmingham, Alabama, the idea that there is some office that has control over Federal funds that's never imposed a sanction, the fact of the matter is -- and it's the reason --
02-1672 +++$+++ 366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you're saying the coach cares more about it than the Government does?
02-1672 +++$+++ 367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That may well be the case, absolutely. And Coach Jackson --
02-1672 +++$+++ 368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if -- if the Government is charged with -- with just spending the funds and doesn't think that this is worth its time, why should there be a private cause of action --
02-1672 +++$+++ 369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because --
02-1672 +++$+++ 370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- when -- when a private cause of action is harder for us to imply than it -- than it is to an administrative remedy?
02-1672 +++$+++ 371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because in this case people like Coach Jackson -- it's hard enough for Coach Jackson to come forward. If he's not able to -- if he's not protected and able to come forward, if retaliation is possible, then you can't expect the -- the teenagers themselves to carry this burden. And in fact, it's the reason this Court recognizes a private cause of action in Franklin and in Davis and in Cannon itself, that you're not going to protect the whistle blower and they're not going to be able to come forward. And it's not just whistle blowers, Justice Kennedy. It's people that want to make their institutions comply and when those efforts at compliance result in penalties against them. It has not led to an excessive amount of litigation, but it has been very effective in giving people comfort to know that they can't be retaliated against. And -- and I -- I understand the -- going to the necessity, but I do think I'm very comfortable with the statute because it is a form of discrimination on the basis of sex. It is part and parcel. The history of discrimination, on which title VI drew, was that firing people from their jobs is what you did when they complained about discrimination, when they tried to vote, when they tried to enroll their students in schools, and it is part and parcel of that discrimination. And it is discrimination against Coach Jackson for his actions on behalf of sex. Thank you.
02-1672 +++$+++ 372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. --
02-1672 +++$+++ 373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'll reserve the balance of my time.
02-1672 +++$+++ 374 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Gornstein, do you have any light to shed on the extent to which administrative sanctions have ever been imposed against schools and -- and the feasibility of going that route?
02-1672 +++$+++ 376 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Administrative sanction has never been imposed under title IX.
02-1672 +++$+++ 377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They have been under title VI?
02-1672 +++$+++ 378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There has been one case in which an administrative sanction was imposed under title VI, Justice Kennedy. It -- the agency does have some flexibility to attempt to get voluntary resolutions that are short of the sanction, the final sanction, but --
02-1672 +++$+++ 379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you take the position that what occurred here can amount to a direct violation of the statute as discrimination?
02-1672 +++$+++ 380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We do, Justice -- Justice O'Connor. I'm sorry. Retaliation against a person because that person has complained about sex discrimination under title IX is itself discrimination within the meaning of title IX. And that conclusion flows from four considerations, beginning with the Court's decision critically in Sullivan because in that case, the Court held that a person subjected to retaliation because he complained about racial discrimination against his lessee could sue under section 1982's prohibition, which only prohibits racial discrimination. Against the backdrop of that decision in Sullivan, Congress would have understood its prohibition against sex discrimination to afford comparable protection against retaliation. So a person who is subjected --
02-1672 +++$+++ 381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why would Congress then in some statutes expressly cover retaliation and in others not? I mean, that's a little odd, isn't it?
02-1672 +++$+++ 382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is, Justice O'Connor, but the explanation for that for -- in title VII, for example, is that the core prohibitions in title VII refer to discrimination based on such individual's race, sex, or national origin, and that such individual's language rules out the kind of retaliation claim we are talking about here.
02-1672 +++$+++ 383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It rules out this one, but it doesn't rule out the main -- look it, this is a weird kind of retaliation claim. Usually the retaliation claim is the person who has been discriminated against complains about the discrimination, and for that complaint, the person who was discriminated against is demoted or not promoted, or whatever. That's -- that's the classic retaliation claim. And that classic claim is surely covered by -- on the basis of that person's sex. If --
02-1672 +++$+++ 384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If it's based on the fact that the -- that the person is complaining about sex discrimination and not on the sex of the complainer, it's exactly the same theory of discrimination that we have here, Justice Scalia. And that theory of discrimination was recognized in the Sullivan decision. Discrimination occurs when there is retaliation against a person because he's complaining about racial discrimination.
02-1672 +++$+++ 385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What was the date of the Sullivan case?
02-1672 +++$+++ 386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was 3 years before Congress enacted section -- I think it was '68 -- '69. I'm sorry. '69.
02-1672 +++$+++ 387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ '69.
02-1672 +++$+++ 388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was '69, Justice Scalia.
02-1672 +++$+++ 389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and you think that we take the same approach to implied causes of action today that we took in 1969?
02-1672 +++$+++ 390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You do not, Justice Scalia, when you are starting afresh, but --
02-1672 +++$+++ 391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And we certainly did not with a Spending Clause case.
02-1672 +++$+++ 392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true, Justice Kennedy. But to answer Justice Scalia's question, first, you operate in the legal context in which Congress was operating at the time, and Congress would have understood -- and this Court has twice relied on the Sullivan decision in interpreting title IX, once in deciding that there was a private right of action and once in deciding that the private right of action included a claim for damages.
02-1672 +++$+++ 393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know what case it is, but one of our cases, the argument was precisely made that the statute before us had been enacted by Congress before we had set our face against implied causes of action, and therefore, we should interpret that statute the way we used to in 1969, and we rejected that argument. We said that our new rule, as to when you find implied causes of action, will be applied to all statutes, whether they were enacted by a Congress that -- that thought we would go skipping along forever as we did in 1969 or -- or not. And -- and that's what you're asking us to do here.
02-1672 +++$+++ 394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice --
02-1672 +++$+++ 395 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Just because Congress in -- in the -- at the time this statute was enacted believed in the existence of a Supreme Court that would readily find implied causes of action, we -- we have to do that for all these old statutes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 396 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let -- let me talk about the cases that I think the principle that you're talking about emerges from. One is the Central Bank case, and what you were asked to do there was to add the words, aiders and abetters, to the statute. We're not asking you to add words to this statute. We're asking you to interpret the words that are there --
02-1672 +++$+++ 397 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what about Virginia --
02-1672 +++$+++ 398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in light of the relevant context.
02-1672 +++$+++ 399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What about Virginia Bankshares?
02-1672 +++$+++ 400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm -- I'm not sure about Virginia Bankshares, but I don't think it -- it states a principle. The other case that I was thinking about, Justice Kennedy, is the -- is the Sandoval case. And again, there somebody was asking you to afford a private right of action for something that the statute did not itself prohibit. And what we are saying here is, interpret this statute in light of the legal context that Congress had it, which is --
02-1672 +++$+++ 401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- it's arguable except that Mr. Jackson was not discriminated against because of his gender.
02-1672 +++$+++ 402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. But this statute does not require discrimination because of such individual's sex. It require --
02-1672 +++$+++ 403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- exactly like title VII, but --
02-1672 +++$+++ 404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's -- it's written exactly not like title VII, Justice O'Connor, and it's written far more like section 1982, which was at issue at Sullivan, which doesn't have a such individual's limitation. And in -- and section 1982 was interpreted to mean discrimination on the basis of race in depriving people of interests of property violates that statute and affords a private right of action to the victim of retaliation. And so too here. And a person who is victimized by retaliation because that person has been subjected before -- because he complained about sex discrimination is a victim of discrimination within the meaning of this statute.
02-1672 +++$+++ 405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that's where you hang. You -- you really think Congress, when it enacted title IX, paid close attention and said -- instead of saying no person in the United States shall on the basis of that person's sex be excluded from participation, you think somebody had -- had suggested that language, and they said, oh, no, no, no, that would make it too narrow. We have to take out that person's. I -- I don't -- it doesn't strike me as a -- as an obvious import of not including the word that person's sex. It's a very natural way to write it: no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex.
02-1672 +++$+++ 406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But this is -- it opens it up to this interpretation, and then you have to look at all the relevant considerations. Inserting the words, such individual's, would foreclose that kind of retaliation claim, and it's not here. And so it's -- then you have to look at all the other relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the fact that this is of vital importance to promoting the purposes of the act, including the fact that the agencies responsible for enforcing this provision have both interpreted -- the key agencies have interpreted it to encompass protection against retaliation, and including the fact that there's absolutely no legitimate interest that a -- a recipient has in retaliating against somebody simply because he's filed a title IX sex discrimination complaint.
02-1672 +++$+++ 407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Gornstein, what implication would there be, if we took the view of the circuit here, for Federal employment? Title VII does have a discrete retaliation provision, but it doesn't with respect to Federal employees, if I understand.
02-1672 +++$+++ 408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. In -- it -- we -- we have taken the position that there is, based on a textual argument within the Federal sector provision, a basis for finding a retaliation prohibition over and above the use of discrimination. We have not taken that position with respect to the -- to some other statutes. So we do think this is a statute-by-statute analysis and that you just can't adopt an automatic principle that because there's an anti-discrimination provision, it automatically always picks up retaliation protection. You have to look at it on a statute-by-statute basis. And here, though, all the relevant considerations, including Sullivan, including the need for this kind of protection to further the purposes of the statute, including the agencies' interpretation of this statute which, by the way, does provide fair notice that this was prohibited, included in -- I think I wanted to get back to Justice Kennedy's question about the Spending Clause. What the Spending Clause does not require is that it specifically refer to retaliation any more than it required that it specifically refer to peer-on-peer harassment. What it does require, though, is fair notice, and that fair notice is supplied by the Sullivan decision, this Court's cases saying that Sullivan is an important backdrop principle against which title IX was enacted, and finally the regulations themselves, which specifically forbid retaliation.
02-1672 +++$+++ 409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are punitive damages available under title IX?
02-1672 +++$+++ 410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry. Punitive damages would not be available against a municipality or against a -- but it could be available against some other private recipients.
02-1672 +++$+++ 411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Gornstein. Mr. Thomas.
02-1672 +++$+++ 413 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: Justice O'Connor, I would like to respond to the question that you raised immediately. I can't think of any school board lawyer who is called by his superintendent and told that I had a letter from OCR and they want to know why you aren't doing this and that who would not be in that superintendent's office that moment because when OCR comes in, they canvas everything. I mean, and as a part of negotiating and their investigative teams, they're lay people. They're not lawyers. They come in demanding, and what they prepare for compliance, I can't even begin to articulate how overreaching it is. And so I say I wanted you to --
02-1672 +++$+++ 414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How often has OCR come to the school district in question under title IX? There are many statutes that --
02-1672 +++$+++ 415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I would want to suggest --
02-1672 +++$+++ 416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- OCR administers.
02-1672 +++$+++ 417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In 1996, we had a conclusion of an OCR title IX investigation because it dealt with boys' football as it related to related sports offered for girls. So we -- we know about OCR, and they're in Atlanta. They are about 167 miles away and when -- and when they come, they come, Your Honors. If I may, I'd like to get right now to what I had raised as the issue here, and that's whether or not an implied private right of action under title IX for retaliation for petitioner who himself says that he's not a victim of discrimination, but merely an advocate. He's an advocate of gender equity, and we say no.
02-1672 +++$+++ 418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How does he differ -- how does he differ from the renter in Sullivan who was complaining about the refusal to sell or lease property to African Americans? He wanted to lease his property, and as a result, he was thrown out of the club. And this Court said he could maintain that suit.
02-1672 +++$+++ 419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I offer this one observation. Under 1982, there is not a corollary administrative remedy. So in the Sullivan situation, the only advocate available at that time was the owner of the home. And -- but I would comment that as he continued in his litigation, he continued to advocate. Under title IX, as we have discussed, for the advocate is the phone call, the toll-free call to OCR and express your concerns and your issues about what's happening. And we find significance in that because the ultimate benefit is for the designated class, which would be the basketball team. In a private lawsuit filed by Mr. Jackson, the damage award goes directly to him. If he's successful in getting injunctive relief, it goes only to him. In other words, school board, you can't retaliate or you're enjoined from retaliating against him in the future, but nothing from that Federal court would go to benefit the girls' basketball team.
02-1672 +++$+++ 420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what -- what do you make of the -- the point that Mr. Dellinger stressed and others have stressed that, in fact, there is no administrative remedy in the real world? It's -- it's -- there -- there have never -- there has never been an instance in which funds have been withheld.
02-1672 +++$+++ 421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, again, Justice Souter, no, the funds have not been terminated. But I can only share with you my experiences with dealing with these people.
02-1672 +++$+++ 422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you with respect to that, is OCR so different from other agencies that have to pick and choose because they simply don't have the resources to enforce? Now, how often does OCR, in fact, go in and investigate? How many times do they say, well, that's low priority for us, girls' soccer or girls' basketball, and we have bigger fish to fry?
02-1672 +++$+++ 423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the only thing that I can say is that on my watch, the number one priority is to keep OCR out. So -- so therefore --
02-1672 +++$+++ 424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that wasn't my question. My question is of the universe of complaints that are made under title IX, how many does OCR actually follow up, or isn't it strapped for resources so that it can't, however much it may want to, come in the way you described?
02-1672 +++$+++ 425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, that was something that was recognized in Cannon. I -- I think that was cited in several of the footnotes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that was the very reason for recognizing a private right of action because the -- the requirement, the anti-discrimination requirement, would be a dead letter if you didn't have people who could enforce it.
02-1672 +++$+++ 427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but again, stay mindful. Geraldine Cannon, though, she said, I did not get admission to the -- the med school because of my sex, and she is clearly within the proviso of no discrimination on the basis of sex. So --
02-1672 +++$+++ 428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but the -- the argument that's being raised is whether we're talking about the person who is listed in the statute as the primary beneficiary of the anti-discrimination statute or whether we're talking about the teacher who blows the whistle and so on -- the -- the argument is unless you allow this teacher or this whistle blower to -- to bring the private action, your statute is a dead letter, that the -- that if -- if -- once you recognize a private action, you've either got to recognize this kind of private action or you can forget the whole thing. That's the argument, and -- and so simply to say, well, they're not within the -- the primary ambit of benefit of the statute is -- is not to the point of the argument.
02-1672 +++$+++ 429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, let me offer this in two ways. One, it's not realistic. In -- in other words, when -- when you have a scenario about the private cause of action, teachers aren't -- I mean, these parents and -- and the -- and especially in Birmingham, we have an athletic director at the school. We have a director of athletics for the whole school system. And so that -- that's not realistic, I mean, because at the end of the day, the administration is very conscientious about all of its programs.
02-1672 +++$+++ 430 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's -- to say trust me is -- is not an answer. Cannon is one thing, a woman in her 30's. A sixth-grader who is told she can't play on a team because there's none for girls is hardly similarly situated and the law won't be enforced as to her unless you have someone who is best positioned to know what is going on, who is the coach.
02-1672 +++$+++ 431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, Justice Ginsburg, we get back to the point who really benefits because -- and especially in this scenario, if the advocate sues and receives the monetary damages, that goes to the advocate.
02-1672 +++$+++ 432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the point is if you say to the school, you cannot retaliate against someone because a complaint has been made, that's a powerful incentive for the school not to retaliate against someone and to do something about the discrimination.
02-1672 +++$+++ 433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but again, though, Justice Ginsburg, the other side of that would be when under the spending legislation, the school board had a right to know what the terms and conditions of the financial assistance would be, and I respectfully submit to you that there was nowhere on the landscape that --
02-1672 +++$+++ 434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why wasn't it in the regulations of the agency spelled out rather clearly -- the -- the agency that says, Congress has told us to implement this statute, here are our regulations and our regulations are you don't retaliate?
02-1672 +++$+++ 435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that's a part of the complaint and investigatory process. Now, Justice Ginsburg --
02-1672 +++$+++ 436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The regulations didn't say anything about a private cause of action, did it?
02-1672 +++$+++ 437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it did not.
02-1672 +++$+++ 438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the statute didn't say anything about a private cause of action.
02-1672 +++$+++ 439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not on the face.
02-1672 +++$+++ 440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the regulation did tell the school not to retaliate in effect. Tell me, does the record disclose what happened to the petitioner, Jackson? What -- what has been the result of all this? Does the record tell us that?
02-1672 +++$+++ 441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it does not, Justice O'Connor. And -- and again, it's on a motion to dismiss, and obviously, once it was --
02-1672 +++$+++ 442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does it tell us that he was removed as coach?
02-1672 +++$+++ 443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does the record tell us that?
02-1672 +++$+++ 445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it does say that he was relieved.
02-1672 +++$+++ 446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I ask you a legal question, nothing to do with, you know, practicalities?
02-1672 +++$+++ 447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But suppose you go back to the very old, bad days of the 1950's in the South, the '60's. They pass some civil rights legislation. A lot of legislation was passed in the '60's. Now, under that civil rights legislation, imagine an individual had been kept out of a restaurant or he'd been treated physically badly, not because of his race. He was white, but he was associating with people who were black. And they both go into the restaurant and they both are refused service. Maybe they're beaten up. I mean, both of them. Now, can the white individual bring a lawsuit under the -- the civil rights statute? I've always thought the answer to that question is, of course, he can. Would you -- do you think it's the contrary answer?
02-1672 +++$+++ 449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, in that context --
02-1672 +++$+++ 450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- I -- I would say yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, of course.
02-1672 +++$+++ 453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But again --
02-1672 +++$+++ 454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So therefore --
02-1672 +++$+++ 455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is this a civil rights statute that provides for a private cause of action? I -- I want to know what the hypothetical is.
02-1672 +++$+++ 456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'd -- I'd like to -- I'm thinking of various civil rights statutes which make it unlawful to describe -- to -- to discriminate. And now, I agree with you on that answer. The white person could bring a lawsuit on the basis of someone else's race because he's being discriminated against not because of his own race, but because he's being -- he's associated with people who are being discriminated against. I agree with your answer. And so my question is if that's so and if we have a long history here of the words, on the basis of sex, including retaliation not on the basis of my sex, but retaliation on the basis of someone else's sex -- that's what I've complained of -- why isn't this the same thing And to get out my whole question -- there are two parts -- why isn't this the same thing? And the second part is, because I think it is the same thing -- the second part is once it is included in 1981 -- in -- is it 1681(a)?
02-1672 +++$+++ 457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Once we include this in 1681(a), that's the end of this case because Sandoval then supports the other side. It doesn't support you. All right. That's my question.
02-1672 +++$+++ 459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, don't we have to consider at some point in time what the congressional intent was?
02-1672 +++$+++ 460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And again -- and I submit to you --
02-1672 +++$+++ 462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you -- you go ahead. I'm doing it purely as a matter of logic. I'm saying the old civil rights cases make clear it doesn't have to be on the basis of your own race. History makes clear that retaliation on the basis of someone else's race does fit within -- or gender does fit within 1681, and then that's the end of the case. So I would like your response to that logic.
02-1672 +++$+++ 463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I would want to submit to you interveningly you have had the passing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. So everybody now has access to Congress. The whole spectrum of American society is in Congress. So if Congress is being well represented, when it passes the law in 1972, as it did here, it had a different perspective on it. Going back to 1969, some things were foreclosed to some of the citizens of the United States. So, obviously, the scenario of someone advocating, like in Sullivan, would make sense. But I submit to you respectfully, that's not the case now. Over there in Congress is where this debate needs to be, and on the face of this statute, it's not there. Retaliation is not there. If I may, though, Justice Breyer, let me also add as a practical consideration --
02-1672 +++$+++ 464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course, you say it's not there, but the agencies interpreting the statute thought it was there. Isn't that correct?
02-1672 +++$+++ 465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but that's an -- an investigatory -- the administrative enforcement scenario.
02-1672 +++$+++ 466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it's the --
02-1672 +++$+++ 467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but their reading of the statute was that the word discrimination included a retaliation claim. That's the kind of regulations they drafted on the basis of their understanding of what Congress intended by using the word -- the words in this statute.
02-1672 +++$+++ 468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But don't we go -- Justice Stevens, don't we go back to Sandoval? Can you in a regulation do more than what the statute requires?
02-1672 +++$+++ 469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You cannot use the regulation that goes beyond the meaning of the statute. That's what that holds. But a regulation interpreting what the statute itself provides is in a different ball park. And that's what I understand these regulations to have done, to say what the agencies thought the statute itself meant.
02-1672 +++$+++ 470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but again, that's retaliation after someone has filed a complaint with the appropriate office.
02-1672 +++$+++ 471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well -- I mean, Sandoval is very clear. It's a very clear opinion in my view. Very clear. And the key language I thought is, the language statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer the private right. So they're looking at disparate impact and disparate impact, according to the majority -- I was in the dissent -- did not intend to protect the person discriminated against, but was a way of regulating people so they wouldn't intentionally discriminate. I can understand that. But I apply the same -- I didn't agree with it, but I can understand it. The -- the -- I apply the same reasoning here. The reasoning here is that this retaliation thing is not trying to protect university behavior one whit more than the whole underlying thing is trying to protect university behavior. This is about victims. Retaliation and being fired is about victims. And so given Sandoval, then we have the history, we have the language, and we have that sentence from Sandoval. And all that suggests -- it goes into 1681(a), in which case Sandoval says, a private right of action, given Cannon, would be inferred. Now, what's -- what's -- that's how -- I'm tracing out the logic of the thing. So I want to see what you say.
02-1672 +++$+++ 472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Breyer, on the face of the statute, I just can't get there. I apologize for that, respectfully, but -- but I can't. And Justice O'Connor, as a follow-up, interestingly enough, in a case on all fours in 1995, Holt v. Lewis, the United States District Dourt for the Northern District of Birmingham -- for the Northern District of Alabama made very clear that an implied private right of action was not cognizable under title IX, and that the regulation was not a basis to follow it. And -- and I submit to you on that basis, that in Birmingham, at very least, because the case was affirmed by the Eleventh Circuit and this Court denied cert in 1997, so anyone who would go --
02-1672 +++$+++ 473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We -- we can't -- you don't base your argument on giving some legal effect to denial of certiorari --
02-1672 +++$+++ 474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, I don't, Justice O'Connor.
02-1672 +++$+++ 475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you.
02-1672 +++$+++ 476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but to say -- I was trying to emphasize was the notice and the mind set of the board when it accepted these Federal funds. It had no way of anticipating that retaliation --
02-1672 +++$+++ 477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It had never anticipated a private right of action, even though it read the Cannon opinion, which was written some 20 years ago? Maybe more than that. I don't remember.
02-1672 +++$+++ 478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Cannon, your opinion there is going to be around for a long time. The scholars are going to have to debate it for years.
02-1672 +++$+++ 479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There were some later cases that cast a good deal of doubt on whether we would apply Cannon anymore.
02-1672 +++$+++ 480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But Congress itself has adopted the rule set forth in Cannon.
02-1672 +++$+++ 481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but if I may, but then Justice Rehnquist cautioned very clearly that the Court -- in his concurring opinion, that the Court in the future should be extremely reluctant to imply a cause of action absent such specificity on the part of the legislative branch. And that just speaks volumes to me.
02-1672 +++$+++ 482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It said in this statute we do, having in mind that title VI would be interpreted in the identical way --
02-1672 +++$+++ 483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, ma'am.
02-1672 +++$+++ 484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- title VII -- VI proscribing race discrimination in all Federal programs. So it said these statutes aimed at race discrimination, sex discrimination do have a -- a private right of action, and that was the holding of this Court.
02-1672 +++$+++ 485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. Well, but -- but again, it goes -- goes back to -- but would that include retaliation? And -- and --
02-1672 +++$+++ 486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it seems to me that if you're talking about the sixth grade soccer team, realistically the only one who is going to know anything -- enough and be brave enough to complain will be the teacher. And if you cut the teacher out, then forget it. You have nice words on paper and they'll never be enforced.
02-1672 +++$+++ 487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, Justice Ginsburg, that teacher could easily, if they don't get a positive response from the administration, they can call OCR.
02-1672 +++$+++ 488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And OCR says, as it usually does, we're too busy. Sorry.
02-1672 +++$+++ 489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. They -- no --
02-1672 +++$+++ 490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Congress didn't give us enough money to do the job.
02-1672 +++$+++ 491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we know that? I mean, do we have any idea how effective the enforcement of OCR is? Just because they haven't cut off funds --
02-1672 +++$+++ 492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I --
02-1672 +++$+++ 493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- they may well not have cut off funds because anybody who gets a directive from them will hop to it.
02-1672 +++$+++ 494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, that's exactly it. I mean, I have firsthand knowledge that when they call, we're supposed to jump. It's no doubt about it.
02-1672 +++$+++ 495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And do they call more than infrequently?
02-1672 +++$+++ 496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All the time. And -- and the other side of that coin --
02-1672 +++$+++ 497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is your personal testimony.
02-1672 +++$+++ 498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. Yes, it is. (Laughter.)
02-1672 +++$+++ 499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and Justice --
02-1672 +++$+++ 500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is -- there is much testimony on the other side that says we call and call and they don't come.
02-1672 +++$+++ 501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I've been in educational law now almost 27 years, representing both teachers and school boards. So I have firsthand knowledge. I mean -- and I've experienced it both at the secondary level and higher ed. I mean, when they come in, they come in.
02-1672 +++$+++ 502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How many title IX complaints in your -- in your experience? You mentioned one. Is there any other?
02-1672 +++$+++ 503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Two.
02-1672 +++$+++ 504 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Two? In how many years?
02-1672 +++$+++ 505 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In 26.
02-1672 +++$+++ 506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Two in 20-something years.
02-1672 +++$+++ 507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, ma'am. But they're all memorable. (Laughter.)
02-1672 +++$+++ 508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. THOMAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're all -- thank you.
02-1672 +++$+++ 509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Mr. Newsom.
02-1672 +++$+++ 511 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I'd like to address, if I may, several concerns that have been raised during the -- the preceding arguments. One is to clarify some things about the scope of the administrative remedy. The other side, with respect, wants you to think that without the implied right of action for damages and fees, whistle blowers are left out in the cold. That is not true. The administrative remedy -- it's not just about funding termination. 34 C.F.R. 106.3 says that the OCR may use any remedy that it deems necessary. The OCR, as we say in our brief, has itself touted its flexible approach to enforcement which includes, among other things, as this Court noted in Gebser, citing back to its earlier -- pardon me -- decision in North Haven, individualized relief in appropriate circumstances. So the point, as Senator Bayh himself noted on the floor of the Senate, is that it is the threat of -- of funding termination. So while the OCR is wielding the club of funding termination, they can extract or leverage individualized relief in appropriate cases.
02-1672 +++$+++ 512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we -- do we have any -- any empirical evidence as to -- as to what they have thus leveraged?
02-1672 +++$+++ 513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ None that I am aware of, Your -- Your Honor, but --
02-1672 +++$+++ 514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the other side says, look, dead letter. What do we know about such life as there may be in the letter?
02-1672 +++$+++ 515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well -- well, I will, I assume, perhaps foolishly, defer to the Solicitor General's office to tell you what -- what the DOJ has and hasn't done. What I can tell you is that -- that the DOJ manual that the other side cites throughout its briefs expressly encourages agencies, when enforcing these -- these things, to leverage even damage awards on behalf of individual claimants. So I can tell you that, as a matter of policy, this is far from a dead letter.
02-1672 +++$+++ 516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- you don't concede the point that it is the role of this Court to determine whether agencies are inefficient or not --
02-1672 +++$+++ 517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course not.
02-1672 +++$+++ 518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and if they are inefficient to -- to raise up private attorneys general to -- to fill the void?
02-1672 +++$+++ 519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course not, Justice Scalia, and -- and the Court knows very well from my brief that our position is that when you're talking about implied rights of action, this Court has made clear, in the cases leading up to Sandoval, culminating in Sandoval, that these sorts of policy considerations really are not relevant.
02-1672 +++$+++ 520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. If they're not relevant, do you think that the regulation which provides -- do you think it's unlawful?
02-1672 +++$+++ 521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do not contest the validity of the regulation.
02-1672 +++$+++ 522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. If you don't contest the validity of it and you think it's lawful, do you think it's doing something other than interpreting 1681(a)?
02-1672 +++$+++ 523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor.
02-1672 +++$+++ 524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What -- what is it doing?
02-1672 +++$+++ 525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- section 100.7(e), the regulation upon which Jackson chiefly relies, we readily concede is a valid, effectuating 902 regulation, but all -- all it does by its text -- and its structure makes clear all it does -- is to govern the internal processes of official OCR investigations. It does not go further than that. This Court in Sandoval was very clear that it was -- that it was only authoritative interpretations of a statute's terms that can be enforced pursuant to that statute's implied right of action. Another point I want to make about the administrative remedy. Justice Ginsburg asked whether funds had ever been withdrawn, and even there, again, if the answer is no, the point is not whether funds have been withdrawn, but that as Senator Bayh himself noted, that the threat of funds is where the heavy lifting is done in administrative enforcement. Another point about administrative enforcement is whether or not there are sufficient resources. That, obviously, was a valid concern in Cannon, given presumably the inordinate number of complaints about core, traditional discrimination. But as the other side has made clear in its briefing in this case, at page 26 of the petitioner's brief -- and then there's a brief filed on behalf of the Southern Poverty Law Center that spins this out in some detail -- there just aren't many of these retaliation claims out there, either in the -- either -- either in the judicial system or at OCR.
02-1672 +++$+++ 526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is that, do you think?
02-1672 +++$+++ 527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, my -- I'm sorry.
02-1672 +++$+++ 528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it because no remedy is available, or is it because there are just very few instances giving rise to such?
02-1672 +++$+++ 529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think in all likelihood, it is the latter. Certainly I would think that the Court would presume -- would not presume ill of local school districts and -- and even State universities, but would presume that they are complying with, if not clearly articulated law, certainly good public policy. The second point is that what the -- the absence of private actions for retaliation shows is that title IX's remedial apparatus is kicking along just fine without the implied right of action.
02-1672 +++$+++ 530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we decide this case on the assumption that there was retaliation here by virtue of a complaint of violation of title IX?
02-1672 +++$+++ 531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Certainly, Your Honor --
02-1672 +++$+++ 532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We should decide it on that assumption?
02-1672 +++$+++ 533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You have to take as true, of course, the facts as pledged in the -- as pleaded in the complaint. Another point I'd like to make briefly is about the comparison to title VII. The other side wants you to look very closely at title VII when you're -- whether it's on the basis of sex or on the basis of such individual's sex, but they want you to ignore title VII and the fact that it very clearly and expressly deals with retaliation in a separate subsection, a separate provision. And I didn't -- I'll have to confess I didn't hear much during the first argument. I had my head in my own book, but what I did hear is Justice Souter referring to the -- the -- an instance in which Congress has a choice of two models for -- for constructing a statute, and it chooses one over the other, and isn't it a reasonable inference to allow Congress to make that choice. That's what happened here.
02-1672 +++$+++ 534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Like the choice it made in 1982, very spare statute. When Congress got to title IX, it knew about Sullivan and so it -- this -- this statute in its breadth and its simplicity bears a striking resemblance to the old pattern in 1981 and 1982 and 1983. So if you say to me, look at the closest model, it would be that and not the more detailed civil rights legislation that came in '64 and '65.
02-1672 +++$+++ 535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if -- if I could answer in two parts. First, to say that I think what was going on in 1964 in the Civil Rights Act, obviously, you have Congress in title VII addressing itself both to discrimination and to retaliation separately; in title VI, passed as part of the same piece of legislation, addressing itself solely to discrimination. And to use Justice Souter's analogy, in '72 Congress takes the title VI model and not the title VII model. Now, to get to your question specifically, I think, about Sullivan is at the heart of your question, Sullivan -- I think there are a number of problems with the other side's reliance on Sullivan. First, with all due respect to this Court, Sullivan itself is pretty opaque. It certainly does not announce with flashing lights a principle that every anti-discrimination provision necessarily entails a subsidiary or corollary --
02-1672 +++$+++ 536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It says if you're thrown out of the club because you champion the rights of a black man, you have a right to sue under this statute.
02-1672 +++$+++ 537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Even if I were to grant your assumption of clarity in Sullivan, which Justice Harlan, I presume, would not agree with -- he was left sort of scratching his head trying to figure out what the Court was trying to do. But even granting your assumption, if 1982 can be construed that way, that -- that construction does not necessarily carry over to every anti-discrimination provision. 1982, of course, uses different language to begin with and, more importantly, is -- is passed under Congress's power under the Thirteenth Amendment, which is the broadest conceivable --
02-1672 +++$+++ 538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but it did construe the word discrimination, didn't it?
02-1672 +++$+++ 539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, sir. Discrimination is not even in -- is not even in title -- rather, in 1982. So the language is very different --
02-1672 +++$+++ 540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ On account of race is in it. Right?
02-1672 +++$+++ 541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'll have to confess I don't -- it does say something like every person shall have the same right as -- dot, dot, dot, as white persons. But so the -- the language frankly is pretty different, and the more fundamental point I'm trying to make is that even if that's true for -- for that statute passed under that constitutional power, here we are talking, as Justice Kennedy made clear at the very outset of the argument about a Spending Clause statute, where it is required that conditions on the acceptance of Federal funds be express, and it is not clear to me where the Birmingham Board would have gotten its clear notice in this case. If you can imagine --
02-1672 +++$+++ 542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me they would get it when Congress says, and here's the statute, very spare, and agency, you get up guidelines, that any responsible school board would say, well, we've got only one sentence in the statute. We better look at the regulations to find out what's required.
02-1672 +++$+++ 543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I agree, and -- and if -- and if the Birmingham Board, which I trust it did, looked to the regulation here, what it would have found is a regulation not that clarifies the substantive scope of title IX, but instead that -- that manages the internal operating procedures for official agency investigations. So to be sure, the Birmingham Board was on notice that it could not retaliate in -- in the business of an official OCR investigation, and if it did, it would be subject to administrative enforcement, but it was -- it was not on notice either of the fact that there was a generic anti-retaliation prohibition, much less the fact that if it violated any such nonexistent --
02-1672 +++$+++ 544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it's -- we're not talking about the procedure, I mean, what procedural moves. What must you do to comply? And it has in there you don't retaliate. So you mean that a board could responsibly take the position, well, the -- the regulations tell us we don't retaliate, but when we're not faced with any agency breathing down our neck, all we have is a teacher in front of us, then we can retaliate? I mean, they must have known the statute meant don't retaliate.
02-1672 +++$+++ 545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and with respect, I think there is a difference, particularly given the clear notice requirements that this Court has -- has used in Spending Clause cases between retaliation in the context of an OCR investigation and retaliation generally, but -- I'm sorry.
02-1672 +++$+++ 546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I really don't get that. If the rule is don't retaliate and if we investigate, that's one of the things we're going -- that's going to be on our checklist. But the substantive rule is don't retaliate.
02-1672 +++$+++ 547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, may I respond?
02-1672 +++$+++ 548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Even granting your assumption, Justice Ginsburg, what is painfully not clear is that the -- is that the Birmingham Board would be subject to -- to a private right of action for damages and fees even in -- in the event that there were some generally applicable anti-retaliation provision.
02-1672 +++$+++ 550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Newsom.
02-1672 +++$+++ 551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NEWSOM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens.
02-1672 +++$+++ 552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Dellinger, you have about 3 and a half minutes.
02-1672 +++$+++ 554 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I should make it clear that we're not asking this Court to create or infer a new cause of action. We're asking the Court to interpret the cause of action that the Court itself recognized in Cannon v. the University of Chicago, that was validated by Congress. It was reaffirmed in the Court's opinion in Sandoval. And when you look at the scope of that -- of that prohibition, that cause of action, why would it not extend to retaliation? The idea that you --
02-1672 +++$+++ 555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Other statutes do it separately.
02-1672 +++$+++ 556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand.
02-1672 +++$+++ 557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Other statutes don't view the one as -- as being incorporated in the other.
02-1672 +++$+++ 558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The practice of Congress has not been consistent on incorporating express provisions sometimes because of language differences, but there are half a dozen major statutes that the courts of appeal have consistently assumed included retaliation as part of discrimination. Section 1981, section 1982, title VI, 1982 as determined by this Court, parts of the Rehabilitation Act have all been construed that way. And why would they not? The notion that you have to admit Geraldine Cannon to the University of Chicago Medical School, you can't discriminate against her on the basis of sex, but then you could turn around and expel her for complaining about your admissions policy makes no sense. In this case, relying upon the vagaries of what any administration might do about enforcement is not necessarily what Congress wanted, and that was this Court's decision in Cannon. And it's reaffirmed it frankly --
02-1672 +++$+++ 559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There are no vagaries in private enforcement. Private attorneys general always act in the interest of the whole polity. There are no vagaries there.
02-1672 +++$+++ 560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. DELLINGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in this case, it has been known to effectuate anti-discrimination laws in order to bring them about by allowing people to step forward. The last point they make is that even if there's a cause of action, and even if the cause of action covers retaliation, it cannot be brought by Coach Jackson because he's not also the victim of the underlying discrimination. That makes no sense in law or in logic. If the captain of the boys' basketball team joins with the captain of the girls' basketball team in a supportive way to say, they're just not treating girls' basketball equally and fairly, and they're both suspended from their teams or dropped from the honor society in retaliation, it makes no sense. Either they both have -- they've both been discriminated against on the basis of sex because they're trying to rectify sex discrimination or neither is. And in this case, it's going to be critically important that this valuable statute, which has meant so much for athletic and academic opportunities for women, to have people like Coach Jackson able to be confident that they've got a right that they can enforce that will allow them to come forward within the school itself and try to rectify these anomalies in and under title IX. Thank you.
02-1672 +++$+++ 561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Dellinger. The case is submitted.
03-10198 +++$+++ 565 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument now in Antonio Dwayne Halbert v. Michigan. Mr. Moran.
03-10198 +++$+++ 567 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The issue in this case is whether, 42 years after this Court decided in Douglas v. California that indigent defendants have the right to the assistance of counsel for a first-tier direct felony appeal --
03-10198 +++$+++ 568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, now, Douglas didn't involve a guilty plea, I guess.
03-10198 +++$+++ 569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It did not, Your Honor. It was a trial case.
03-10198 +++$+++ 570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And did the Court say anything about the effect of having it be a guilty plea? I guess it didn't.
03-10198 +++$+++ 571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It did not. None of this Court's cases in the Douglas line have turned on whether the conviction was by trial or by plea.
03-10198 +++$+++ 572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does that make a difference or could it?
03-10198 +++$+++ 573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't believe it does, Your Honor, because as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, all sorts of difficult, technical issues can arise in a guilty plea. Of course, certain issues are waived. Trial issues are waived by the effect of a guilty plea, but many other issues remain. And as Mr. Halbert's case demonstrates, especially in the guilty plea cases -- this Court well knows the effect of the Federal sentencing guidelines -- very complicated issues of sentencing law arise. And now Michigan has a sentencing guideline system that is perhaps more complicated than the Federal system that's been in effect since the 1980's.
03-10198 +++$+++ 574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Did -- did your client waive any right to appeal here in connection with the proceedings of the plea?
03-10198 +++$+++ 575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He did not waive a right to file an application for leave to appeal. Because of the --
03-10198 +++$+++ 576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What did he waive?
03-10198 +++$+++ 577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He waived the right to have a -- to have what is called in Michigan an automatic appeal, in other words, the right to automatically have full briefing and oral argument. So what he agreed to by pleading was to go through the application for leave to appeal procedure which involves a preliminary determination of merit as to whether the appeal should proceed.
03-10198 +++$+++ 578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why didn't he waive the right to have counsel for that -- for that purpose since that was the law in Michigan?
03-10198 +++$+++ 579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, he did not -- first of all, as a matter of fact, he did not. He was never told at any point during the plea proceedings that he would be giving up his right to counsel.
03-10198 +++$+++ 580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, he was told what -- what right to counsel he would have and it didn't include this.
03-10198 +++$+++ 581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He was told that under certain circumstances the judge would appoint counsel.
03-10198 +++$+++ 582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the judge never said, under any other circumstances, I will not appoint counsel.
03-10198 +++$+++ 584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, isn't that a perfectly natural inference if you're told you get A and B, that C and D might have been -- that C and D will not be given?
03-10198 +++$+++ 585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It might be a natural inference for somebody with a level of sophistication, but Mr. Halbert is a special education student, functionally illiterate. And nobody explained to him that he wouldn't be given his right to counsel.
03-10198 +++$+++ 586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, did we take this case on the ground that he wasn't adequately advised or did we take the case on the ground that even if he were advised, he'd still have his right?
03-10198 +++$+++ 587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I hope the latter, Justice Kennedy, because this is a case in which the State is making a waiver argument. And, of course, the waiver argument is not part of -- is not the intent of the statute. What the statute does is it tacks on and, by the way, the defendant should be advised at the time of the plea that they won't be getting counsel.
03-10198 +++$+++ 588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I take it you would challenge the validity of the waiver even if he were advised?
03-10198 +++$+++ 589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-10198 +++$+++ 590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And even if he said, I hereby waive?
03-10198 +++$+++ 591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, we would because that is a waiver that is designed to extract only from the poor. That waiver has no effect whatsoever on those with money because, in fact, a money defendant is not even eligible for appointed counsel on appeal. So that waiver has no effect whatsoever on --
03-10198 +++$+++ 592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, wouldn't -- I'm -- I'm sorry.
03-10198 +++$+++ 593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would have no effect whatsoever on money defendants I'm saying.
03-10198 +++$+++ 594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wouldn't your position be different if he had been advised that he had exactly the right that you claim he has, and the court said, however, in Michigan you may not enter the -- the plea unless you waive that right? If -- if you don't want to waive that right, which I've just explained to you, we'll -- we'll have a trial. Would -- would your answer still be that -- that waiver would be as a matter of law impossible?
03-10198 +++$+++ 595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The waiver would be unconstitutional under those conditions because it is a discriminatory waiver. To show how breathtaking the State's argument --
03-10198 +++$+++ 596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How -- why is that prejudicial to him? He says, okay, I can't plead guilty. I really did it but I can't plead guilty. Go ahead.
03-10198 +++$+++ 597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry.
03-10198 +++$+++ 598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why doesn't he just have a trial? He says, I'm not going to contest the trial.
03-10198 +++$+++ 599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, as this Court has long recognized, a trial provides very substantial benefit. I mean, excuse me. A guilty plea provides very substantial benefits. And so the effect of the Michigan statute then would be only the money defendant can receive the benefits of a guilty plea and then have sentencing errors corrected.
03-10198 +++$+++ 600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, is that what you were going to say to Justice Souter, before I interrupted, that it's -- that it's far-reaching.
03-10198 +++$+++ 601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Well, not only that, if the State's waiver argument is correct, then presumably the State could extract a waiver saying you can't have free transcripts. You can't have the waiver of the filing fees. In fact, the State could extract a waiver saying you can't have counsel at sentencing.
03-10198 +++$+++ 602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ These are all disparate impact arguments. There's -- there's -- you're not making any argument that the State intentionally discriminates against the poor. You're just saying the effect of this is harder on the poor than it is on the rich. But I thought our -- our equal protection cases have -- have said that disparate impact doesn't -- doesn't hack it as far as equal protection is concerned.
03-10198 +++$+++ 603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, I actually have two responses to that. First, this is intentionally aimed at the poor. Looking at 770.3a, the statute under -- in question here, it is clearly aimed at the indigent. It refers to the indigent. So this is a statute that on its face is -- is taking away the right of the indigent and only the indigent to have -- have an attorney. So I don't agree that is is a -- simply a disparate impact case. But in the context of appellate counsel for a first-tier felony appeal, this Court's cases have -- have not applied the same line of analysis that this Court has applied in other contexts, and I think that's quite clear most recently in the MLB case --
03-10198 +++$+++ 604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In any event, you pointed out that on the face there is the distinction on the face of it --
03-10198 +++$+++ 605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- it is not a disparate impact case at all --
03-10198 +++$+++ 607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- because it affects only indigents.
03-10198 +++$+++ 609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. There is no question that this statute was enacted for and specifically applies only to the indigent. It has -- it has no impact whatsoever on the wealthy, and it's aimed at the -- at the indigent only. So I do -- I do not agree that this --
03-10198 +++$+++ 610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Whenever a State has -- has initially given a broad benefit to the poor, whenever it cuts back on poor -- on part of that benefit, it is denying equal protection to the poor? That -- that seems to be an extraordinary proposition. The State isn't picking on the poor. It's just saying that -- that the -- the free counsel we have agreed to provide in the past we're no longer going to provide in this -- in this one instance of guilty pleas. And -- and you say that -- that is intentional discrimination against the poor?
03-10198 +++$+++ 611 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's not a -- a disparate impact claim I say, because it is intentionally aimed at the poor. The statute was designed to take away counsel from the poor and only from the poor.
03-10198 +++$+++ 612 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So any cutback on benefits that is given -- on benefits that are given to the poor is intentional discrimination against the poor.
03-10198 +++$+++ 613 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not saying any, Justice Scalia.
03-10198 +++$+++ 614 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Just this one because that's your case.
03-10198 +++$+++ 615 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This case certainly is.
03-10198 +++$+++ 616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're saying this is case like Douglas which was equal protection, like a free transcript, like a filing fee for an appeal.
03-10198 +++$+++ 617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 618 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're bracketing --
03-10198 +++$+++ 619 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This case -- in many ways the restrictions that are placed on the indigent's ability to appeal in Michigan, as a result of this statute, are worse than those that were struck down in Douglas because at least in Douglas the court, the appellate court, would review the entire transcript, looking for arguable issues. We don't even have that here. All we have here is the indigent forced to shift for himself, forced to try and determine whether there are any issues, forced to order his own transcript. Under the Michigan statute, the indigent has to figure out how to obtain his or her docket entries, his or her transcripts, his or her prisoner account statements, all the documents necessary for filing a first appeal that would ordinarily be done by counsel. And so --
03-10198 +++$+++ 620 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I just understand one point that Justice Scalia's question raises for me? In your view, is the provision of counsel for the indigent for appellate purposes purely a matter of grace, or was there some underlying obligation to provide counsel?
03-10198 +++$+++ 621 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, it's my -- it's certainly my contention, Justice Stevens, that Michigan is required to afford appellate counsel in this situation for a first-tier direct felony appeal on the merits.
03-10198 +++$+++ 622 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that ultimately your case rests not on equal protection but due process.
03-10198 +++$+++ 623 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's a merger of both principles, as this Court said --
03-10198 +++$+++ 624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's one as much as the other, isn't it?
03-10198 +++$+++ 625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, you're -- we're saying if you're going to provide a first appeal of right, one incident of that is, as a matter of due process, you've got to provide counsel.
03-10198 +++$+++ 627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Souter.
03-10198 +++$+++ 628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you're -- you're retracting the pure equal protection claim? I don't think you want to do that. I mean, you would say that even if there were not a due process right, you would still regard this as -- as directed against the poor.
03-10198 +++$+++ 629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is directed --
03-10198 +++$+++ 630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or not?
03-10198 +++$+++ 631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is directed against the poor, which is why there is an equal protection component to this argument, but this Court's cases --
03-10198 +++$+++ 632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you say that component wouldn't exist unless you begin with a due process right to have counsel on appeal.
03-10198 +++$+++ 633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe that's right. It's -- it's difficult -- I have to confess, Your Honor, it's difficult sometimes to separate out the due process and equal protection strands from the Griffin and Douglas line, and this Court most recently in MLB said that there is a certain merger. Also, I believe in Smith v. Robbins this Court reiterated that there is a certain merger of the lines in these cases. But --
03-10198 +++$+++ 634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're -- you're saying that the due process is what gets you beyond the stage of merely providing counsel as a matter of grace. That's what due process does for you. Because they have to provide counsel not merely as a matter of grace, you have a very clear equal protection case which you would not otherwise have. Isn't -- isn't that the way the two work together?
03-10198 +++$+++ 635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that's right, Justice Souter. I think I agree with that.
03-10198 +++$+++ 636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can -- in your view, can the State require a waiver of the right to appeal for everyone?
03-10198 +++$+++ 637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's a question this Court hasn't decided, and I don't have a position on that. But that's far different from this case because that would not be discriminatory.
03-10198 +++$+++ 638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'm not so sure. It certainly goes to the importance or the significance of the underlying right. My understanding is -- correct me if I'm wrong -- that in the Federal system, we require waivers of the right to appeal frequently, even waiver of the right to appeal the sentence even before the sentence is calculated, as I understand it.
03-10198 +++$+++ 639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And do you question the lawfulness of that?
03-10198 +++$+++ 641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't. And that -- that case has not come before this Court yet, and so I don't know how this Court would decide that case if it comes. I know some of the Federal circuits have upheld such appellate waivers as a part of a negotiated guilty plea. One thing the Michigan statute is -- does is it takes away the right to appeal effectively for indigents without negotiation. It's -- it's the baseline.
03-10198 +++$+++ 642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Mr. Moran, if -- if you're -- if you're tying your equal protection claim to a due process claim and if it is not a violation of due process to require people to waive their -- I mean, you can waive entirely the right to appeal. Surely you can waive the right to counsel on appeal. If that's not a violation of due process, then your equal protection claim dissolves.
03-10198 +++$+++ 643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, the problem is -- is that the statute requires only the poor, imposes a forced waiver on only the poor.
03-10198 +++$+++ 644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's an equal protection claim.
03-10198 +++$+++ 645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's an equal protection claim.
03-10198 +++$+++ 646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you've -- you've said your equal protection claim hinges on the due process claim. If the due process claim, in turn, hinges upon waiver, then apart from the -- from the dispute in this case as to whether waiver occurred or not, if waiver does occur, there's no due process claim, and then there's no equal protection claim.
03-10198 +++$+++ 647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm really not sure that you can separate out the two strands of the Fourteenth Amendment again, and I know this Court didn't try in MLB, and I know this Court didn't try in Smith v. Robbins, so that there is -- there is a component of both. And it's precisely because of these sorts of questions that I think you have to view them as an integrated whole for purposes of the Griffin/Douglas line.
03-10198 +++$+++ 648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In any case --
03-10198 +++$+++ 649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where -- where do we find the waiver here? Is it in the joint appendix?
03-10198 +++$+++ 650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's my position there was no waiver, but the --
03-10198 +++$+++ 651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you referred to something that was waived.
03-10198 +++$+++ 652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where would we find that?
03-10198 +++$+++ 654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the plea proceeding. It's the plea proceeding. And it's --
03-10198 +++$+++ 655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, don't take your time to look it up. Maybe counsel for respondent can find it for us.
03-10198 +++$+++ 656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's -- it's in the joint appendix --
03-10198 +++$+++ 657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- beginning on page 19.
03-10198 +++$+++ 659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's their argument anyway. Let them --
03-10198 +++$+++ 660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm missing something on waiver, but I would have thought a person can waive a -- a right to have a counsel on appeal. He can waive a trial. He can waive a jury trial. But before he has to -- before he decides, he has to know that he has the constitutional right to a jury trial.
03-10198 +++$+++ 661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And why wouldn't he also have to have the -- to know that he has the constitutional right to a lawyer to represent him?
03-10198 +++$+++ 663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's my position Justice
03-10198 +++$+++ 664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. That has nothing to do with equal protection. It has to do simply with a very common sense rule that we apply in every case, jury trial, et cetera. So all we'd have to say is, of course, he has a right to a lawyer. Now, if he wants to go back and waive that right, fine.
03-10198 +++$+++ 665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's all. That's the end of it.
03-10198 +++$+++ 667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So what's all this complicated thing about?
03-10198 +++$+++ 669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If an indigent, after being sentenced, decided for whatever reason I would prefer to go on appeal by myself, which is actually a -- a right this Court rejected in Martinez, that you have a right to represent yourself on appeal, but in Michigan an indigent is allowed to -- would be allowed to represent himself or herself on appeal if they chose to do so. The problem here is that the statute purports to take away the right, and it's our position that this is a --
03-10198 +++$+++ 670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. You'd have to say the statute is wrong in taking away the right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But he can waive it if he wants to, knowing that he has the right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right. We have no problem with a voluntary waiver. We certainly have a problem with a forced waiver saying that you cannot enter a plea which produces tremendous benefits in Michigan, as everywhere else, unless -- unless you agree to waiver --
03-10198 +++$+++ 674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, but -- but that happens all the time. I mean, the waiver -- waiver of appeal in -- in guilty -- in guilty pleas. That's -- that's not permissible either?
03-10198 +++$+++ 675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I take no position on that. It may or may not permissible.
03-10198 +++$+++ 676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you have to if you're going to make the argument you just made.
03-10198 +++$+++ 677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's far different because that's something that can be obtained in negotiation. But what we would have --
03-10198 +++$+++ 678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Mr. Moran, here on page 22 of the joint appendix, the court is speaking to the defendant and says, you understand if I accept your plea, you are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal as of right.
03-10198 +++$+++ 679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you think that was not effective?
03-10198 +++$+++ 681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. That was effective. That -- that's referring to the automatic appeal that he would have if he went to trial where he would have full briefing and oral argument. The Michigan --
03-10198 +++$+++ 682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- it doesn't say that.
03-10198 +++$+++ 683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, it doesn't. This was a -- this was a pretty poor waiver proceeding in a number of -- of respects, but it --
03-10198 +++$+++ 684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, he does --
03-10198 +++$+++ 685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm --
03-10198 +++$+++ 686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- he does go on to say that -- that he can appoint a lawyer for -- in certain instances. He doesn't complete the explanation by saying there are other instances and when I will not appoint one. That he leaves out, although this a represented defendant.
03-10198 +++$+++ 687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, he was.
03-10198 +++$+++ 688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He had a counsel at the plea hearing.
03-10198 +++$+++ 689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He did.
03-10198 +++$+++ 690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm mixed up again. What is the answer to this? I -- I would have thought that even if those words that Justice O'Connor read referred directly to the kind of appeal that we have in front of us -- in other words, the one that's at issue -- that still he'd have to know he has a right to a lawyer on that appeal before he could waive it.
03-10198 +++$+++ 691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Breyer, I agree.
03-10198 +++$+++ 692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And does anybody dispute that?
03-10198 +++$+++ 693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe --
03-10198 +++$+++ 694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that at issue here?
03-10198 +++$+++ 695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I believe the State might dispute that. I'm not sure. What the Michigan constitution does, Justice O'Connor, if I may come back to your question, is it says that for somebody who pleads guilty or nolo contendere, they are giving up the right to the automatic appeal, and they have -- they then have to proceed by the application for leave to appeal. And so the Michigan constitution explicitly still provides a right to appeal, but it changes the method. And so Michigan's appeal, after a guilty plea now, is like the first appeal in several other States, Virginia, West Virginia, and -- and several other States have guilty plea appeals.
03-10198 +++$+++ 696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's a strange terminology. It doesn't provide a right to appeal. It -- it provides a right to apply for an appeal, a right to ask for an appeal. A right to ask for an appeal is not a right to get an appeal.
03-10198 +++$+++ 697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's framed in terms of a -- of a right. Page 2 of the brief --
03-10198 +++$+++ 698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you have an absolute right to ask for an appeal.
03-10198 +++$+++ 699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's not a right to appeal. It's a right to request an appeal, which can be granted or denied.
03-10198 +++$+++ 701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
03-10198 +++$+++ 703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's a -- it's -- what Michigan has done is it has changed the method of the appeal. And so Virginia, for example, has first-tier appeals by petition. West Virginia has a first-tier by petition and --
03-10198 +++$+++ 704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's done more than change the method. It's changed the entitlement. The court can simply say we're not interested in your appeal. It doesn't raise a significant legal issue.
03-10198 +++$+++ 705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Scalia, but that's not how the -- the Michigan Court of Appeals works. The Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court. And so in Mr. Halbert's case, the Michigan Court of Appeals denied his appeal, after his futile attempt to -- to identify his issues, with an order saying that there was a lack of merit in the grounds presented. That is a preclusive decision on the merits of his case. That --
03-10198 +++$+++ 706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's just -- but that's just boiler plate, isn't it? That's what they say in all these cases.
03-10198 +++$+++ 707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I think Michigan cites a Michigan Supreme Court decision that says it's not on the merits.
03-10198 +++$+++ 709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That --
03-10198 +++$+++ 710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's People v. Berry?
03-10198 +++$+++ 711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. That was a decision of the Michigan Supreme Court referring to its own orders denying applications for leave to appeal which are not on the merits. The Michigan Supreme Court denies the applications for saying -- by saying, we are not persuaded that we should hear the questions presented.
03-10198 +++$+++ 712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, why wouldn't it be the same if the -- if it's a discretionary appeal at the intermediate appellate level?
03-10198 +++$+++ 713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because the Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, is an error-correcting court. And so it issues orders saying denied for lack of merit. And the Michigan Court of Appeals dozens and dozens of times in the last 25 years has said, without exception, that is a decision on the merits that precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine.
03-10198 +++$+++ 714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Didn't -- didn't the supreme court in the Bulger case -- was that the name of it?
03-10198 +++$+++ 715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Didn't it say that the -- that the intermediate court's denial of -- of appeals was a discretionary judgment?
03-10198 +++$+++ 717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It called it a discretionary appeal, Justice Scalia, without ever explaining why, and the -- the dissent in Bulger pointed out the Michigan Court of Appeals is an error-correcting court. And in fact, the very author of the --
03-10198 +++$+++ 718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That was a dissent, though.
03-10198 +++$+++ 719 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right, but the very author of the opinion in Bulger, Chief Justice Corrigan, just 1 year later or 2 years later describes the effect of -- of an order denying leave to appeal in the Michigan Court of Appeals, and says it clearly shows they considered and rejected the merits.
03-10198 +++$+++ 720 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So, in effect, it's discretionary in the sense that it's discretionary as to whether to give it full-dress treatment, but the bottom line, whether they give it full dress or -- or merely discretionary denial is -- is an implication on the merits.
03-10198 +++$+++ 721 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, exactly as in Virginia. In Jackson v. Virginia, the Court recognized that the -- the Virginia situation is exactly the same, that there is a petition to appeal to the Virginia Court of Appeals, and that each petition is considered on the merits, and a denial of the petition is seen as a decision on the merits that precludes relitigation under the law of the case doctrine. And so Michigan's appeal after a guilt plea now is exactly like the one in Virginia.
03-10198 +++$+++ 722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that something the intermediate appellate court has said? Have they said that, that -- we have a -- a discretionary appeal, but every -- in every case it's a merits decision? We don't have any decisions that say we are exercising our discretion not to review.
03-10198 +++$+++ 723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If a -- if a appeal or an application to the Michigan Court of Appeals is filed in the wrong form or is untimely or has some other defect, then the court will occasionally issue an order denying the application for that reason. But for any properly filed application for leave to appeal, the longstanding practice of the Michigan Court of Appeals is to say it is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented.
03-10198 +++$+++ 724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This means, I would presume, that -- that we would -- we would have to give -- our Federal courts on habeas would have to give deference to all decisions of the intermediate court since they're all on the merits.
03-10198 +++$+++ 725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And they do.
03-10198 +++$+++ 726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Federal courts do?
03-10198 +++$+++ 727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-10198 +++$+++ 728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They assume that all factual and legal arguments have been decided against the -- the person applying for a discretionary appeal?
03-10198 +++$+++ 729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. After Abela v. Martin in the Sixth Circuit. And there is a -- a whole host of Federal district court decisions in the Eastern and Western District of Michigan all saying that when an order is denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented, the AEDPA standard of review applies. And so the State obtains tremendous benefits from this procedure. They obtain deference on habeas corpus review. They prevent the indigent, if the indigent were to ever get a lawyer at some later stage, from beginning relitigation on State collateral review. And so the State very happily argues for all of those purposes that this is a decision on the merits, but then they come before this Court and they say, oh, no, it's not a decision on the merits. It's really discretionary despite what it says because they are hoping that this Court will conclude that it is a discretionary appeal. In fact, the State --
03-10198 +++$+++ 730 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Moran.
03-10198 +++$+++ 731 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- has made an even more radical argument in its brief. The State maintains that the appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal, and that is plainly contrary to the -- to the actual function of that court because there is a provision that if trial counsel suddenly realizes in a plea case, after sentencing, that there are issues that she should have raised, it allows her to do that. And so the State now argues that that's really the first-tier appeal, and then the application that follows after that to the Michigan Court of Appeals is a second-tier appeal. I'll just point out that even the State's amicus doesn't agree with that, and -- and rightfully so in light of Swenson v. Bosler, which has rejected an attempt to reorganize by labeling how one's appeals go.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know what extraterritorial application means if it doesn't mean that, that a ship that is not in the United States is bound by United States law. What -- why isn't that extraterritorial application?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The reason, Justice Scalia, would be because the accommodation that was offered, that was entered into, and that began in the United States -- and -- and I would point out -- I think this is important to keep in mind --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What you're saying is it would -- I thought you were saying that it would be the enforcement of the domestic contract of which the -- the statutory provisions would be an implied term. Isn't that it?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Yes, that's correct.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It does not apply of its own force. It applies because two parties in the United States contracted that it would apply. Is that it?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. Now -- now, I -- I would just add that I think it -- you could characterize a public accommodation, you know, five nights lodging, for example. If that's entered into in the United States and -- and that begins in the United States, that a necessary term of that is nondiscrimination, and --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, then if you --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- if you have an ADA claim that governs that even if the discrimination occurred abroad, that would only relate to those things tied into the accommodation.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if you're on a round trip ticket from Liverpool to Miami and back, it would depend on where you bought the ticket.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, again, we -- we think that if accommodation begins here in the United States, that -- that a necessary term of that is nondiscrimination. Now, whether you characterize that as a contract claim or as a substantive application of the ADA, I'm not sure there's much of a difference.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but Justice Stevens' question is you buy the ticket in Liverpool. Is the ADA -- an -- an American buys the ticket in Liverpool to come to the United States.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To come to the United States.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is the ADA an applied term of that contract?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would -- I would assume not, although the question then would be whether or not it's a public accommodation that's been offered in the United States.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Don't -- don't all --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Even in U.S. waters? That wouldn't make sense. An American buys a ticket in -- in Liverpool. He's disabled. He goes to New York, Miami, New Orleans, and he's discriminated at -- at each step. No -- no coverage just because of where he bought the ticket?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no, Justice Kennedy, that's not our position. Let me -- let me try and be clear. We think that any vessel that comes into the internal waters and ports of the United States and offers a public accommodation or a specified public transportation service to our residents is subject to the ADA.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that means --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If -- if you had a situation -- I'm sorry.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, go ahead.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you had a situation where you had a ship that -- let's say, that began in -- in Great Britain and came here, it didn't pick up passengers here in the United States, I think that the better view would be, sure, United States law could apply to it because it's in our internal waters, but that as a substantive matter, with regard to the ADA, I don't know why that would be a public accommodation within the meaning of the ADA because it's not an accommodation that's offered --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But do you --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- or available to United States residents.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you agree with Mr. Goldstein that nothing turns on -- one might characterize this kind of cruise as U.S.-centered, but his answer was as long as they put in, a regular cruise stop, they pick up, they unload passengers, they take them back again on the ship, so long as they touch base at a U.S. port, letting off and picking up passengers, the ADA applies? Do you agree with that interpretation?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As I understand what Your Honor just said, I think that I would. Let me just clarify, though. We think the relevant question is whether that ship would -- has offered a public accommodation or a specified public transportation service --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This is my --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in the United States, and if the answer is yes --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let -- let me ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Goldstein. Even in the Cunard case, the prohibition case, they couldn't have liquor in the U.S. port, but when they leave and they go to Jamaica, they could pick up rum there. They could have liquor all the rest of the time so long as, when they enter and leave the U.S. port, they didn't have the liquor aboard. Here what you're saying is what goes in the -- for the New York port goes for every other place where this ship puts in.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, again, I -- not as a matter of -- not as a matter of extraterritorial application of U.S. law, but that is our position with regard to a public accommodation that begins in the United States. I -- I think the -- the important --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose it doesn't begin in the United States in that it -- it starts in, say, The Bahamas, and stops at --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I should probably should not have said begin, Your Honor. What I mean is if it -- if the public accommodation is provided for in the United States, that would be covered by the terms of the ADA, we think the ADA applies.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then you're saying exactly what everybody is worried about. I take it there is no way really for a ship to -- they either have the right door or they don't have the right door. And we're interested in the set of cases in which they're going to have to change their doors. And what I came in here thinking was we're talking about ships that pick up people and sail in Florida and sail around the Caribbean. That's the -- now, I've heard nothing but we're not talking just about those. We are talking about ships like I'm the last human being alive that went on a Swiss ship to Europe. Okay? (Laughter.)
03-1388 +++$+++ 3182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 50 years ago. And -- and we're talking about those ships, or we're talking about merchant ships that also say to the public, come as a passenger. Now, I would like to -- not what you're arguing. You're going to say, yes, we are arguing it. I want to know -- say something to relieve my concern about that set, which was Justice Ginsburg's concern. We are trying to rule the world in respect to those ships that only come here occasionally or it isn't a big part of their business, but they want to come to pick up American passengers.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. Sure. And what I would say with regard to that is that you're right that our broad view is that the ADA applies if that -- if they're offering public accommodation here in the United States. But if you reject that, I think there are several ways you could approach that. One would be to apply traditional choice-of-law factors that are -- that are applicable in maritime, and you could conclude, you know, based on sort of whether or not there are sufficient contacts here and whether or not --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you're saying that this is your position, but don't worry about it because we'll reject your position?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. He asked me to say something that -- that would -- would help his concerns. What I'm trying to say --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ One thing might be true, what you're not saying, is there really aren't very many of those ships, or another thing you might say, which you're not saying because maybe isn't true, is almost all of those ships that there are are already subject to tougher -- tougher rules, say, in Europe. But you don't say either of those.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. No --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Since you don't you say either of those, I think neither may be true.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't know the specific number. I would think that there are not many that the -- that this -- what you're concerned with primarily here are cruise ships that are in the business of providing public accommodations. But I would add as well -- and I think this is very important that the Court keep in mind -- that the clear statement rule, as it's -- as it's posited by respondent here, would not just apply to the ADA. It would apply to all U.S. laws, and that would include title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in its prohibition of racial discrimination, and I would find that that would be a remarkable construction.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It depends on what -- what kind of laws you're talking about. Laws that require the crew to be treated differently are -- are quite different from law -- laws that -- that require a passenger to be treated a certain way in the United States.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, you're correct, and that's precisely why they have --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And laws -- laws that require structural alteration of a ship are quite different from laws that say while you're in United States waters, you won't discriminate on the basis of race.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If -- two -- two responses, if I may, Your Honor. And that is, if you -- if that is the conclusion you reach, then you still need to remand this case because there are an awful number of claims that are precisely those kinds of claims that the Fifth Circuit would not allow. Secondly, I think you're wrong with regard to the scope of the clear statement requirement. There is no requirement that you have to have a clear statement to apply a U.S. law to a foreign vessel. There is only a requirement that you need a clear statement if the conduct at issue would relate only to the internal matters of that vessel. And here you're dealing with public accommodation --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If we haven't expressed it yet, we ought to express it then.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I disagree, Your Honor. And what I would point you to is -- is that the long -- every time this Court has spoken with regard to the clear statement requirement relating to foreign-flagged ships, it has referred to the internal order doctrine. And that is embodied in a number of bilateral agreements that go back for centuries. The -- the treaty that was at issue in the Wildenhus's Case expressly said that if the -- if the conduct did not relate to members of the crew but to passengers or other members of the port state or otherwise affected the interests of the port state, that the port state law would apply. And that is the general rule. The international regime that governs this area by its terms provide minimum standards and leaves it available to port states and to flag states to add additional requirements. That would mean --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Salmons, one of the alternatives you threw out, not as a response to clear statement, but as a -- a response to the issue that was being raised by it, was the provision of the statute that it was intended to exercise the -- the fullest extent of the -- of the commerce power. And The -- The Bahamas respond to that by saying you could have said exactly -- or argued exactly the same thing in McCulloch. What is your response to that?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I would disagree with that on -- on a couple of respects. The first is that the definition of commerce here is broader than it was and specifically refers to travel between the United States and foreign countries. The only other statute we're aware of that says that is title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In addition --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, may I just ask you a -- a factual question? I didn't go back to the text to check this. Does the text of this statute say in these words basically we are exercising the fullest possible extent of the commerce power?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Justice Souter. What -- what the text of the statute says --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it's not in McCulloch.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. What the text of this statute says is that -- in fact, this is the definition of commerce that relates only to title III of ADA. And it says precisely that it includes travel between foreign countries and the United States and that Congress was intending to -- to reach the full sweep of its -- its constitutional authority.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Salmons. Mr. Frederick.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3204 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case is about congressional intent not congressional power. Congress undoubtedly has the power --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could you address the last point?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. It was not the fullest extent of the commerce power. That statute was at issue in this Court's case concerning the Lanham Act where the Court said that a violation of the Lanham Act that occurred in Mexico but had an effect in the United States was intended to be covered by Congress because that commerce clause, Justice Souter, did state to the fullest extent of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. This statute does not say that. This statute talks about commerce in and between States and territories, and it is much closer to the statute language that this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case where --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it -- it doesn't have the fullest extent language then.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. That's correct.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How does it compare to title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there are slight differences in the language, but I don't think that's dispositive because title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which this Court addressed in the ARAMCO case, the Court -- the Chief Justice's opinion there said that that language was not enough to express the intent.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So that would be the same for title II, which is the public accommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So I take it that you are saying that on these foreign-flagged vessels, just as the ADA would be inapplicable, so title II, the public accommodations part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, would be inapplicable.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's all a question of congressional intent, Justice Ginsburg, and there's no indication of an intent that Congress needed to address any problem that arose with respect to that form of discrimination.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So your -- but your answer is, there being no such indication, that a ship putting in at a U.S. port was free to discriminate among its passengers on the basis of race.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there would be no U.S. congressional statute that would address that, Justice Ginsburg. There would be a violation of the Bahamian constitution which prohibits --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm asking about the U.S. law and policy which says no segregation, no discrimination in places of public accommodation.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As I said, I'm not aware that there has ever been an instance of that in the cruise industry. Congress has not addressed that. We're talking about foreign ships here. And I want to get back to the structural features of the ship because the ADA fundamentally --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but this is a good question, and what is your position? That the ship could engage in racial discrimination while in U.S. ports on the selling of tickets and the provision of accommodations while in U.S. ports and within the 3 --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice O'Connor, our position is that Congress has not spoken to the question, and so there is no congressional statute that is on point.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then your answer, I take it, is yes, it can discriminate and it can discriminate because Congress has not told it not to. Is that it?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. No. Our position is that it can't discriminate because a different law proscribes that --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So far as United States law is concerned, it could.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the same answer for 1981?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, as I said, Congress has not extended its laws to the full reach of U.S. territorial power, and this Court has maintained that position ever since the Charming Betsy case 200 years ago, The Schooner Exchange case, and Brown v. Duchesne.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let's put it this way. So my understanding of your answer is that we could write an opinion ruling for you but leaving these other questions open? I don't see how we can do that.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What you say, Justice Kennedy, is that the clear statement canon requires Congress to say when it intends to apply a law to a foreign vessel. Congress didn't do that.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if I'm writing the opinion and I put that down and rule for you, it seems to me that I then answered necessarily Justice Ginsburg's question in the negative.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You do, Justice Kennedy. And just as this Court in the ARAMCO case said that title VII doesn't apply to the foreign -- work in a foreign land by an American company of an American --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But these --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, Congress hasn't extended criminal laws of the United States to the full reach of U.S. power. It is only proscribed 15 offenses that will apply in the special maritime jurisdiction.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Frederick, this is -- this is what concerns me about your answer. I know that Mr. Goldstein took the position that it doesn't matter what kind of operation this is, but the operation that we're dealing with, it sells tickets mainly to -- what percentage of its passengers are from the USA?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Approximately two-thirds to three-quarters in any given year.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And does it normally start the voyage and end it in U.S. ports?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The majority of them do.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And how much of its advertising budget is pitched at U.S. customers?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, there -- all of those questions are going to be answered as a predominant marketing effort, et cetera is directed to the U.S. market.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, this is the anomaly. You're asking us to buy an interpretation. An enterprise is U.S.-centered in terms of where it gets its business and that enterprise, nonetheless, is not bound by what is our bedrock anti-discrimination law both with regard to customers, passengers, and employment.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the reason, Justice Ginsburg, is that that law imposes structural changes on vessels that go to other ports.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why don't you -- why don't you try to draw that line? Why don't you say that just as the applicability or not may depend upon whether you're dealing with a crew of a foreign ship or whether you're dealing with an American who happens to be injured on board that ship, so also it may depend upon whether the anti-discrimination law in question is one that at least in some of its applications requires structural changes or not? That would enable you to say the ADA doesn't apply, but would not compel you to say that title II doesn't apply.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We are talking --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're not willing to take such a limited position.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, I think the Court could certainly carve out in its clear -- articulation of the clear statement principle some of these lines. It becomes very --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the ADA itself makes an exception for things that aren't readily achievable. I mean, you could certainly lean on that because a structural change probably isn't readily achievable.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice O'Connor, Congress, when it talked about readily achievable, did so in terms of cost. It didn't do so in terms of conflict with the laws of other nations or --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there -- is there -- I mean, you're giving me the answer I thought the other side would give me. All right? And I appreciate it actually. (Laughter.)
03-1388 +++$+++ 3246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You say that two-thirds of these people, the customers, are American. So we're dealing with a business that is primarily American, not a business like the Swiss ship except with the exceptional cases. Then you say, all right, still it's a problem because of structural changes we'll have to make. What changes? That is to say, I would have thought I could have read, but I haven't, that other countries like Europe also have discrimination laws against disabled people, and therefore, given that fact and given the document that Mr. Goldstein produced, it is highly unlikely that your clients will have to make any significant structural change that they wouldn't have had to make anyway.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, what's the response to that?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's completely false. In -- in the year 2000, the United States Government issued a report that contained an extensive appendix, which we've cited in our brief, that details in laborious detail the conflicts between land-based ADA standards and SOLAS. Now, I can give you some specifics, if you would -- that are fairly practical, such as the ADA requires under the interpretation advanced by the petitioners that there be a disabled access cabin on every level of the ship, but SOLAS requires that passengers with disabilities be placed near evacuation points.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why -- why can't you just fight that battle by battle on what's reasonably achievable? Because in order to avoid that problem, what you're telling us is that a cruise line can charge a -- a disabled person double the price --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As a matter of fact --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- because they're a nuisance. And that's your position.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, as a matter of fact, we categorically deny the claims of discrimination here. We're having to fight this on the basis of assuming the -- the allegations are true, but they are categorically false. And --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it doesn't matter what you want to do as a matter of good will. The question is what the law requires you to do, and you're saying it's up to us, we govern. You're not governed by U.S. anti-discrimination law.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, what the other side wants is a case-by-case method of decision-making in which a district judge becomes the special master of the cruise industry so that each claim of discrimination that would require some modification to the ship --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That happens to every employer under -- in the United States under the reasonably achievable standard.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's why, Justice Kennedy, it's a question of congressional intent. The very same Congress debated extensively about whether to impose design requirements on foreign ships in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and it decided to buck the international system knowingly by imposing a design requirement that double hulls be imposed on oil tankers, foreign oil tankers.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Frederick, that brings up a question I've been meaning to ask you. To what extent was this whole problem of the application of this statute to the foreign vessels discussed in the legislative history of these statutes?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Zero. There is not one word about vessel --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. If -- if that's so and if you look at the earlier cases -- but all I could get out it is that those earlier cases -- the Court tries to do what it really would have thought Congress would have intended in the circumstances. And if that's so, why wouldn't Congress really have intended that a business that's two-thirds American has to abide by American law?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because it was encroaching on an area of foreign sovereignty. Foreign ships are governed by foreign laws.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does -- does Britain -- or does Britain or does the European Union, for example, forbid you to charge this double price?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does European law -- I'd be surprised if it doesn't forbid it, but do you know?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I don't know the answer to European law on charging of an additional price, but I would point out that pricing, like evacuation procedures, do go to the structure of the vessel. And we're talking here fundamentally in the ADA about structural changes that they want to impose that go -- when ships travel, they can't dismantle those structural changes when they leave U.S. waters.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. -- may I ask this question to you? What about a -- an American-flagged ship? Does the statute apply or not?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the Fifth Circuit reserved that question.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is your view?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Our view is that there are arguments that can be made that it does not because Congress didn't --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is your view? Not what arguments can be made. What is your view?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think -- (Laughter.)
03-1388 +++$+++ 3272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I think our view is that it doesn't.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does not apply.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does not apply because Congress didn't express the intent.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So really, we're not concerned with the fact this is a foreign-flagged ship. You're concerned with the fact it's a ship.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- there's a difference and -- and there are about 1,000 U.S.-flagged ships that carry passengers, so that if Congress had given any thought to the question, it is reasonable to suppose it might have distinguished between U.S. ships for which U.S. law directly governs and foreign ships that are governed by a different law. The fact --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we need -- do we need a clear statement for United States ships? I thought your case rested on a clear statement requirement. Is there any clear statement requirement for U.S. ships?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, Justice Scalia.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So why -- why isn't there a clear difference between the two?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because there aren't any words in the statute that go to ships. The best they can do is a catchall phrase at the end of bus, rail, and any other means of conveyance.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's pretty good, isn't it?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's not -- (Laughter.)
03-1388 +++$+++ 3283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you don't require a clear statement, that's -- that's good enough, it seems to me.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your -- your case hangs on the fact that, you know, when Congress wants to -- to rule the world and say all ships in the -- in the world that touch at our ports have to have this kind of a thing, it says so clearly. It doesn't have to say so with perfect clarity with respect to American ships.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With respect to foreign ships, there is a clear statement rule and that clear statement rule is embodied in the fact that a foreign ship is governed by the law of the flag state where it is registered. That's been the rule for 200 years. And the other side's position --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, is that limited, though, just to things that affect the internal order of the ship? Is that the context in which we've articulated that rule?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's been articulated in several different contexts. In the Brown v. Duchesne case, the Court 150 years ago articulated in a patent case where the Court said that a patented device on the ship, which was the French ship in Boston Harbor infringing an American patent-holder, would not apply U.S. patent law. And the Court said, because we can't conceive that Congress would have imagined this general language to encroach on the sovereignty of a foreign ship. Now, the other side has exactly two sentences to say about that case, but that is the case that is directly on point because that case says that when you are dealing with American laws that are generally written, you would not ordinarily apply them to a foreign ship unless Congress said so specifically.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but in that case, there was -- as I understand it, there was no legal relationship of any sort between the supplier of the patent-infringing object and the ship in the United States. So it at least made sense to classify that with internal order as opposed to external relationships arguably involving -- or implicating American law. You've got exactly the opposite situation here. You've got contracts made in the United States with the foreign cruise line. You didn't have that in your patent case.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Souter, you have a foreign ship owned by a foreign corporation built in a foreign country under foreign engineering standards --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With its principal place of business in the United States.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ For a time before that ship moves into another market.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But its significant external -- its significant commercial relationships are in the United States with people in the United States performed partially in the United States.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In just the same way that McCulloch the Court said that labor standards for a course of business that is regular between Honduras and the United States is not going to be sufficient to apply --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The crew members were Honduran in that case.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They were.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This -- if you just look at it, suppose you were not a lawyer and you look at this operation. You'd say that's got USA written all over it. The passengers are from the USA. The company is centered in Florida. And then you have this flag of convenience that it flies which can legitimately govern the relationship with its crew. But to say that it governs the relationship with passengers, it seems to me very strange. And also the ticket says, passenger, if you're going to sue us, it's got to be in the United States and under U.S. law to boot.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But a choice-of-law clause, Justice Ginsburg, has never been held to incorporate law in the sense that laws that don't apply are going to be incorporated. I'm not aware of any choice-of-law clause that -- that simply takes in every domestic statute.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3300 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Just -- it's just one other indicia that one looks at this operation and says this belongs to the USA. A practical judgment, I think, would come down there.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3301 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and you would have -- under their theory, you would have the Consumer Products Safety Act, the Food and Drug Act, OSHA, all sorts of other statutes of general application that are now going to be imposed on foreign vessels simply because they do a lot of business in the United States. The problem here, as a matter of congressional intent, is we don't know what Congress thought about this, and because Congress --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we -- we do -- we do have the rule if it -- if it applies to the internal operations of the ship, and so far as the crew is concerned, the Jones Act and OSHA, it seems to me, may well be governed by the law of the flag.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the internal operations of the ship, Justice Kennedy, is part and parcel of how it is designed, what are the evacuation points, how are the cabins laid out, what ramps are placed where, how -- everything about the ship's design --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a part of the case I'm not sure about, and it seems to me, again, it can be fought out under the reasonably achievable --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't -- Justice Kennedy, the problem with that theory is it just doesn't comport with the language of -- of the statute. Congress didn't think in terms of -- as it did in the Oil Pollution Act, it said, if there's a conflict with international law, work it out. Get the Coast Guard with the foreign nations and work out the conflict. It didn't put anything like that in this statute, which is a further indication that if Congress wants to extend this kind of disability protection, it can do that, but it ought to do so willingly. And the Government has had 13 years to come up with rules that would govern cruise ships, and the best they've done, a few days before the top-side briefs in this case were filed, is to issue proposed draft guidelines for ferries, not cruise ships. Most of the regulations that they are pointing to wouldn't have an application to a large passenger cruise ship. If Congress wants to change this, it certainly has the power, but this Court need not open up a Pandora's box of domestic legislation to apply to foreign ships where Congress has not expressed the intent to do that.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could you go back to Justice Breyer's question about the number of foreign ships? Once we get beyond cruise lines, does it -- would -- would the -- the application on your view cover the -- the dozen passengers who decide they want to take a trip on a -- on a cargo boat?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I don't perceive a limiting principle to the other side's position. In fact, there's an amicus brief written where there's only one or two stops in the United States a year, and under their view, that ship would be governed by the ADA as well. If -- if Congress wants to enact these limits, it's certainly free to do so, but this is a highly complex area and ships are different from land-based accommodations because you have to be able to evacuate people within 30 minutes. And so when we train people, we have --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But doesn't it -- on the other -- on the other side of the coin, apart from the structural problem -- and I understand the arguments on both sides there. With respect to things like safety drills and access to gambling tables and all that, it seems to me that your answer to that would be, well, we'll just do that once we're on the high seas so there's no conflict with the statute when we're out there.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As a matter of fact, Justice Stevens, we give evacuation drills to the disabled in a different way. We have special access and assistance squads that go to persons with physical challenges to get them off the vessel in an event of a -- a need for evacuation. That's a different procedure than most passengers, but it's -- it is one that is in place.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Frederick. Mr. Garre.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3312 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Applying title III of the Americans With Disabilities Act to foreign-flagged vessels would invite precisely the sort of international discord, conflict, and confusion that Congress presumably seeks to avoid when it writes American laws.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you agree with Mr. Frederick's answer about title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964? I mean, a lot of countries don't prohibit discrimination.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, first let me make clear that the Bahamian Government does and all of its cruise vessels are governed by that prohibition.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm asking about the application of U.S. law.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We think that that question can be resolved along the lines that Justice Scalia suggested, which is that when you're dealing with a matter that goes to the internal affairs of the ship -- and there -- we would suggest that there is more central to the internal affairs of the ship than its construction and design. Under international law, article 94 of the Law of -- Law of the Sea Convention, which the Bahamian Government has ratified -- and by the way, the United States has not, and that's an important principle for this Court to keep in mind -- foreign-flagged states may be bound by different international treaties than the United States. So simply trying to draw some conflict resolution device that would deal with treaties that the United States has entered into, international nations have not will not address that problem.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So before you go on to that, I want to be clear on your answer to title II of the Civil Rights Act of '64. There's -- you say, well, that's easier to comply with. But that's not the principle under which you're operating.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. With respect, Justice Ginsburg, our principle is that when it comes to the matters that under international law have been traditionally governed by the flag state, then when Congress writes its laws, we presume that unless Congress clearly indicates an affirmative intention to address those matters, it did not intend to. When Congress wrote the ADA, not a word of the statute indicates that it considered the international repercussions of applying that law to foreign-flagged vessels. Not a word --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What about the -- what about the full sweep argument? Let's sort of come full circle on that. You -- you say the full sweep argument is no good because the same thing could have been made in McCulloch. The response was there is a textual difference --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's -- what's the full sweep argument? I don't --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Full sweep of the commerce power.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, first of all, it's -- it -- the statute doesn't say full sweep. It says sweep, and that's in the findings of the ADA. It's reprinted on page 32 of petitioners' brief. And second of all, the definition of Congress, which doesn't contain that sweep language, is almost identical to the definition of commerce in McCulloch, which is on page 15, note 3 of that decision, and that definition, the United States argued in the McCulloch case, was not sufficient to extend U.S. labor laws to foreign-flagged vessels. It's important to understand the -- the potential international conflicts that extending the ADA to foreign-flagged vessels could create. There are more than 40 nations that have adopted anti-discrimination laws for the disabled. Three nations have -- have adopted laws for domestic vessels: Britain, Canada, and Australia. If a country like the United States extended its laws to foreign vessels that entered its ports, then other nations may well follow suit. And if you take a simple hypothetical example, the Queen Mary II traveling from South Hampton to New York, if you look at the guidelines that Britain has adopted for domestic vessels, those guidelines contain different structural and design requirements than the draft guidelines that the United States have promulgated. There are different requirements for door widths. There are different requirements for sloping. There's different requirements for the watertight compartments. There are different requirements about whether vessels have to be -- have accessible cabins all throughout the ship.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ When you say different, you mean you cannot comply with both.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that what you mean? Or -- or are those just minimums and -- and the United States would -- would comply with those minimums?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, I think in some you could and in others you couldn't. And -- and that's an important -- important point.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And incidentally just for the -- are -- this ship has -- these are regulations that help the disabled?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor. And -- and in many cases, it's not going to be clear which regulation is going to be more accommodating to the disabled and which is not.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could they work that out? That is, if two-thirds of our universe really is American-based, in terms of customers, and we're now only talking about conflicts in -- real conflicts that -- that affect, say, one-third of the universe, that's also true in areas like antitrust or others where the enforcement authorities get together and they try to write memoranda that -- that work this out in a reasonable way. Could -- could the same thing happen here if such real conflicts did emerge?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We don't think so, Justice Breyer.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because?
03-1388 +++$+++ 3332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We would take the same approach that this Court emphasized in -- in the McCulloch case, which is that kind of ad hoc balancing analysis would wreak havoc for the question whether a significant regulation like the ADA would apply to a vessel. How would foreign vessels know, when they enter U.S. ports, whether they have to undertake the extraordinary changes --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The answer would be yes, you do. You do have to, and then if there's some other authority that wants to get involved in this, the two authorities would work it out.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, the way that those issues are worked out in the international shipping context is through the International Maritime Organization. This organization has been responsible for crafting scores of conventions, hundreds of shipping codes, and it's already begun to address the issue of accessibility on ships for the disabled and the elderly. We cite the 1996 guidelines in our brief. Those guidelines right now are -- are not binding guidelines, but they could well become binding guidelines. And when an organization like the IMO addresses this question, it resolves --
03-1388 +++$+++ 3335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's perfect because then the Government says that once it becomes a matter of binding international rule, anything that conflicts with that will be viewed as not reasonably achievable. So all you have to do is that and then there's no longer a problem with American law, according to them.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we don't think the readily achievable language in the first case in any way contemplates conflicts with international law. This Court has a separate canon that's almost as old as the country that it presumes Congress doesn't intend to interfere with international obligations or international laws, including customary international law, as you wrote for the Court last term in -- in the Empagran case. We presume that American legislatures give respect to the interests of sovereign nations when they write their laws, and we don't assume that Congress intends to intrude on the sovereign interests of other nations. And that's what extending the ADA to foreign-flagged ships would do. The Bahamian Government has a solemn responsibility under international law and under its own law to govern the construction and design of all flags of all ships that fly -- fly its flags. Article 10 of the Geneva Convention on the High Seas recognizes that flag states have responsibility for the construction and design of ships. Article 94 of the Law of the Sea Conventions specifies that flag states have responsibility over administrative, technical, and labor matters, including construction and design matters. These are precisely the sorts of matters that for centuries the flag state has been responsible for. And in the Brown v. Duchesne case, this Court recognized that, a case that dealt with the application of patent laws to the construction and design of a foreign-flagged vessels. There are going to be conflicts within -- between international law and the requirements of the ADA, but first of all, there's going to be confusion. It's been more than a decade since the ADA was passed, and we don't even have final regulations as to what rules apply. And in the meantime, foreign-flagged vessels are going to have to be reviewing the case law in the United States courts, determining on a vessel-by-vessel, design specification-by-design specification as to what standards apply. That's only going to create additional international discord and confusion. Petitioners proposed solution to this problem we think is telling. They urge this Court in their reply brief if there is a problem after the ADA is extended to foreign-flagged ships and other nations begin to follow suit and you have a crazy made -- maze of different regulations applying to construction and design, then at that point, the United States can go to the IMO and ask it to clean up the mess. With respect, we think they have it backwards. The purpose of the IMO and the international framework that exists for governing regulation of shipping is to establish a uniform set of rules in the first instance. The IMO has already begun to address the problem at issue in this case, accessibility for the disabled. They are available to address that in a multilateral fashion. And Congress, in enacting the ADA, gave no indication that it weighed any of the international repercussions of the action that petitioners urges the case -- petitioners urge the Court to take in this case. And we would urge this Court to return this matter to Congress. Congress is in the position to weigh the risk of international confusion, to weigh the potential for international discord and to address those matters as it sees -- sees fit. If there are no further questions.

03-1388 +++$+++ 3339 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. GOLDSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg, our position is the one that can accommodate your concerns. Theirs cannot. Just like in Empagran, where this Court built in comity considerations, relying on cases like Lauritzen that involved foreign-flagged ships, it said, look, even if the text of the Sherman Act or the FTAIA could literally reach it, in these cases that we don't think Congress could have conceived of, we're not going to apply the statute. But here, we have a situation in which this company has 95 percent of its cruises going in and out from the United States. Millions of people, and billions of dollars in commerce are affected by this statute and Americans that Congress had to have in mind.
03-1388 +++$+++ 3340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Goldstein. The case is submitted.

03-1395 +++$+++ 3346 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case, like the Totten case almost 130 years ago, is at bottom an effort by alleged spies to obtain additional compensation for services rendered.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, do you take the position that the Federal Government couldn't enforce any provision of such an agreement either?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. That's correct, Justice O'Connor, with respect to the kind of espionage arrangements and contracts we're talking about.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, suppose -- suppose somebody, allegedly a former spy, is alleged to -- by the Government to have breached the agreement by writing and publishing a tell-all book about it.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice O'Connor, I think that actually points up the important differences between the way that the CIA deals with its employees and the way that it deals with its espionage agents like respondents are alleged to be.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, okay.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With respect to espionage agents --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would the Government be without any recourse if it was an alleged espionage agent?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe that's true, Justice O'Connor, because the espionage agents do not sign prepublication review agreements. They do not receive formal security clearances the way that an employee does. And unlike an employee, they do not have access to a broad swath of classified information that raises attendant counterintelligence concerns. And so if you think about the course of dealing that the agency has with its employees, the employees are able to sue the agency in court under, for example, title VII, and the agency can turn around and sue their employees to enforce things like the prepublication review agreement that was issue -- at issue in this Court's Snepp decision. So in the employment context, I think it's very difficult to say that there's an implied term of the employment contract that either side will not have judicial recourse.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what if the employment contract is with an American citizen to act as an espionage agent and nobody else knew about it. Would -- would that -- would he be treated as an espionage agent or as an employee?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If I understand your hypothetical, Justice Stevens, I think that individual would be treated as an espionage agent if it's just somebody for sort of a one-off assignment. And I think that -- that is illustrated by this Court's decision in Totten. I mean, William Lloyd, for example, was a U.S. citizen. He agreed with President Lincoln to engage in espionage activities in the south. And this Court held that when the estate of -- of Mr. Lloyd came to seek compensation from a court, that there was no judicial remedy to enforce that alleged agreement, and the remedy, if any, lay with the President's contingent fund.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I'd like your help on this. Your interpretation of Totten -- does it say that there is just no actionable contract, or does it say there's no jurisdictions like political question? I mean, you win under any of those theories, if we accept them. But which is it?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Kennedy, it's a difficult question to answer because I think there are a lot of different strains underlying the Totten decision, and I think there is --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but you need to get to whether there is -- do you urge dismissal for lack of jurisdiction in the district court or a dismissal on the merits? It's not clear to me at all.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice O'Connor, I think it's better understood as simply a rule of dismissal, that it's not really a pure jurisdictional defect. It's been referred alternatively as a jurisdictional bar or as a rule of dismissal, and of course, as this Court reminded us recently in the Kontrick decision, people tend to use terms like jurisdiction loosely in these contexts.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'm -- I'm not going away with a clear idea of your position.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do I -- do I -- does the Government file under 12(b)(1) like a jurisdiction, 12(b)(6), no cause of action? Of course, you'd probably do both, but I -- I want to know --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- what your best thinking is of what Totten means. It seems to me that this just means that there can be no contract formed under these circumstances.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, I think the general practice of the Government is to file under both. I believe that's what happened here. I think the fact that we file under both suggests that there is a little bit of confusion about it. I would tend to agree with you it's better understood as a rule of dismissal under 12(b)(6) because if you think about the Totten decision, there's really two strains to the decision. One is a recognition that the claim to relief necessarily depends on a fact that the law has always regarded as secret, and in a sense that case simply can't proceed. And that's very analogous to this Court's holding in Weinberger against Catholic Action. There's a second strain to the case, though, and that is that the very idea of walking into court and filing the action is inconsistent with an implied term of the contract or, indeed, the whole nature of the espionage relationship. And I think particularly if you emphasize that second strain of the Totten decision, I think it's better understood as a 12(b)(6) dismissal because what you're really saying is somebody is walking into court and they are effectively pleading themselves out of court because as -- if you look at this complaint here, it starts out with a recitation of the fact that these individuals allegedly engaged in espionage activities and that they were denied certain promises that were made to them after they carried out, quote, their end of the bargain.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If there's no cause of action, there's nothing to -- to claim on, what's -- what's the closest analogy? Is it like a promise to make a gift, which is unenforceable? Is there kind of a contract analogy that we can use?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I mean, I -- you know, one -- one way of thinking about it, but I think it's a very rough analogy, is it's almost like an unlawful contract. It's a contract that the law just doesn't recognize. And I think that -- that reflects the underlying reality of these cases, which is there is something inherent in an espionage relationship that when you enter an espionage relationship, you understand that you have no protected status under the law. I think that has, with respect, been clear in the -- not just in the Totten decision but from the very beginning of the republic. I mean, ever since Nathan Hale agreed to cross British lines as a spy, it was understood that he had no legal recourse, that he had a status that was not recognized at the law. And I think that is -- it has always been thus, and I think there is no reason to revisit the --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does -- does that mean -- the no legal recourse at all mean that you could torture an agent if you were dissatisfied with his work performance?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I don't believe that's true, Justice Stevens, and what I would distinguish is between a constitutional claim that an -- an agent -- an alleged agent might have that doesn't depend on the espionage relationship. As I would understand your question, I mean, it would -- there would be a -- a substantive due process claim that anybody could bring if the Government tortured them. They wouldn't have to allege that I had a secret espionage relationship with the Government and then they tortured me. That would be irrelevant to their claim.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could I -- could I bring you back to your -- your earlier discussion of a spy who is also a -- a Government employee? Are you telling me that he -- he cannot sue for his regular salary simply because the work he was doing was -- was espionage? I mean, he's -- he's a GS-whatever, GS-16, and the Government just doesn't send him his monthly check.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He has no recourse for that check just because he's been doing spy work?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3374 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, that's not the position, and -- and I -- and I apologize if I gave that impression in answering Justice Stevens' hypothetical. I understood to be the hypothetical that you had a Government employee who engaged in a separate spy endeavor, if you will, and then tried to sue to collect on the damages owed under that -- for that particular endeavor.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3375 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, not -- not for his regular GS salary.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3376 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. My -- my hypothetical was an individual who's not a Government employee but is hired by the Government to engage in espionage activities.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Exactly. And as I indicated to you earlier, Justice Stevens -- that in a sense that's not a hypothetical. That's the Totten decision itself. William Lloyd was -- or at least alleged that he was employed by President Lincoln to engage in those services. And in answer to Justice Scalia's question, if William Lloyd happened to be an employee of the -- of the Comptroller of Currency or something, he could still sue to get whatever remedies he had --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He couldn't get the 5,000 bonus for being a spy. Right?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly right. No bonus dollars for being a spy under those circumstances.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could you clarify on the employment question something else? It's -- it's in your reply brief and you say you're contrasting this type of claim with a title VII claim which -- in which you say that the Court in Webster relied on the CIA's historical practice of litigating employment disputes. The CIA's historical practice, not the Court's rulings. Are you suggesting that even with respect to employment litigation, it's up to the CIA to decide what its practice will be?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think so, Justice Ginsburg, but the point is that the reason that -- that I think that the Government would have had almost no ability to invoke a Totten-type defense in Webster or in a title VII case is because of its course of dealing with its employees. And I suppose that if the agency completely changed its course of dealing with respect to its employees or entered a very different course of dealing with certain select employees, then a Totten defense might become available in those circumstances. But as I indicated earlier, I think if you look at the overall nature of the agency's relationship and rights vis-a-vis its employees, even its covert ones, that's a very different relationship than the agency has with respect to espionage agents. And again, that's because they enter contracts with them. Each side has certain litigation rights, and I think it would be a bit of a stretch for the Government to come in and say that there's an implied term of that employment agreement that forecloses a judicial remedy.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I guess the Government can't enforce -- cannot enforce these contracts either. Right? I mean, you take the good with the -- the bad with the good?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly right, Justice Scalia.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You've never sued a spy to -- who hasn't carried out his mission?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Certainly not -- I'm not aware of such a suit, and I've been told by the agency that it's impossible. And I think it just reflects the nature of these agreements, and it does -- it --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can -- can we go back to the -- another threshold question? You did press below and Judge Tallman urged that the reason this case can't be in the district court in California, or wherever, is it has to be in the Federal Circuit. This is a contract claim against the Government. Are you abandoning that position?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Ginsburg, in fact we have abandoned it. We abandoned that position at the cert stage. We made that clear to the Court in our certiorari papers, and we don't renew any type of jurisdictional objection at this stage.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are you free -- are you free to abandon it? Is the -- is the Government's surrender of its immunity from suit for contracts, provided that the suit is brought in the Federal Circuit -- is that something that you are free -- Congress having said that, that the executive is free to say, well, we could take advantage of that, but we don't want to?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I think the answer to that is that it probably is jurisdictional in the pure sense and so if this Court disagreed with our view that there wasn't a Tucker Act problem, this Court could reach that issue and send the case back on the Tucker Act grounds. So maybe I could explain to you why it is that we think that there's not a Tucker Act problem, at least at this stage of the litigation. The Ninth Circuit's reasoning on this was a little bit oblique, but as I understand it, there were two parts to it. First of all, that there might be some kind of substantive due process claim here that did not depend on the contract but rather somehow stemmed from the fact that there was some endangerment of these individuals and that gave rise to some substantive due process right. And even if that claim, as the Ninth Circuit recognized, is not one that is formed on the contract or an implied contract, it seems to me that that's a claim that's clearly within the coverage of the Totten doctrine because it is inherent in the espionage relationship that the individual will be engaged in a -- in a situation where they will be endangered. And I think that was certainly true of William Lloyd in the Totten case. When he crossed southern lines, he was very much endangered, and that's something that wasn't lost on President Lincoln. In footnote 3 of our opening brief, we have a quotation from President Lincoln about the inherent dangers of spies crossing lines and the need for secrecy to protect that. So that's why I think that claim is properly understood as not being covered by the Tucker Act and not being required to be brought in the Court of Claims, but nonetheless a claim that is barred by the Totten doctrine. The other point they made was with respect to the specific regulations that the agency has internally, and they suggest that there might be a claim here that was based on the regulations independent of the contract. But in order for that claim to go forward, the Court would have to examine the unredacted version of the regulations. And even if the Court is right that there's a need for further proceedings on that question, it makes no sense to interpret the doctrine in a way that requires the Government to wait to assert a Totten defense until there is a jurisdictional question cleared up that actually requires discovery because I think what Totten recognized is -- is there is a need to dismiss the claim at the outset before any discovery because of the nature of the suit. So for those two reasons, we thought that the -- that the better view was that the Tucker Act problem was either not presented because of the substantive due process claim or not ripe and that we would pursue the Totten act.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that would make a lot of sense if you really felt that what Totten is is -- is a dismissal on the merits, just saying there's -- there's no contractual claim. I -- I mean, if you didn't believe that, if -- if you believed that what Totten says is we have no jurisdiction, then we'd have no problem and we could resolve all of the questions. But it seems to me if you believe that Totten is based mainly -- you know, it's a contract case and said the contract is just totally invalid, we shouldn't be reaching the contract issue. We should simply say that if -- if we agree with you, that there's no substantive due process claim here and -- and no claim based on the regulations. How do we get the authority to decide the -- the contract question?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think whatever the status the contract question has, whether it's 12(b)(1) or 12(b)(6), I think it's a -- it's a threshold issue and I think this Court under the Rohrgas authority can reach that issue at the outset. And I think it would be particularly perplexing to have a doctrine that said that when we have a suit that we know on the face of the complaint cannot be brought in any court, that we are going to not reach that issue in favor of trying to determine first which court it properly belongs in, when that inquiry in fact will get us into the exact classified information that we know at the outset the suit should not involve in the first place. And I think there is enough flexibility in this Court's Rohrgas decision to allow the Court to reach that threshold question first.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you're saying that if there's no contract, then there's no substantive liberty to protect under the -- under due process procedures.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I think that follows, Justice Kennedy. I think one of the difficulties with the constitutional theory that's advanced on the other side is it gives -- it seeks a right to enforce internal procedural handling mechanisms for claims that we know there's no legitimate expectation for their enforcement at all. And it seems odd that this would develop in a way where the procedural rights somehow trump the substantive rights, and we know from Totten that there is no substance here that can be brought forward in the courts. I think in this respect it is also important to recognize that, as a practical matter, an agent who's negotiating in the shadow of the Totten decision and the broader understanding that Totten reflects is likely to seek assurances not just about compensation but about how -- how their claims would be heard by the CIA and how they're going to get their compensation. And I think there's no particular reason to think procedural assurances should be judicially enforceable when the substantive assurances are not. Now, one other point to make about the nature of these agreements. Not only because of the nature of these agreements does the agency end up in a position where it cannot enforce these contracts itself through judicial actions, but it also ends up in a situation where it may have to give up-front payments that it otherwise wouldn't have to give and the like. So there are consequences to both sides of dealing in this way with these espionage relationships as effectively outside the law. But again, it has always been thus, and I think there is no principle in -- in any recent development that requires this Court to revisit the rule of Totten which, as I said, suggests an -- it reflects an understanding that date backs -- dates back much further. If I can make one other point, which is I think even though the Totten decision reflects something more than the state secrets privilege, because there's a more fundamental defect with a suit that's premised on an espionage agreement than just the fact that it tends to compromise secret information, it is true that applying the Totten rule of dismissal does provide a clear mechanism that protects confidential information. And I would analogize it to this Court's decision in Snepp where the Court adopted a constructive trust arrangement. The Court adopted that arrangement where -- where an employee who violated a -- a prepublication review agreement had to turn over all the proceeds to the Government. And -- and the Court adopted that remedy in favor of a damages remedy, and the Court did so to send a clear signal to the employees that there is no incentive whatsoever to violate the terms of these agreements. In the same way, having a clear rule of dismissal sends a clear message to espionage agents that there's no point in even bothering to file the suit in the first place. It will simply be dismissed.

03-1395 +++$+++ 3398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I just wanted to ask one. I don't remember whether the briefs discuss it or not, but is there a statute that prohibits the disclosure of secret agents like this and does that -- if so, does that have any relevance to this case?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, there is such a statute. There's a statutory provision that gives the authority. It had been with the -- with the Director of Central Intelligence. The recent Intelligence Reform Act has transferred it to the Director of National Intelligence. But it gives a requirement that the -- that -- that the director protect sources and methods. I think that that -- that statutory provision is consistent with the general notion behind the Totten doctrine, but I don't think it's --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And does the statute impose a penalty on anyone for revealing the name of a secret agent?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think it -- it certainly doesn't impose any kind of monetary penalty. There are, under certain circumstances, criminal penalties for the disclosure of classified information, but I think that the --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But is the identity of an agent a -- a type of classified information protected by the statute?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it is. It's protected both by the sources and method provision, and I think revelation of a source could implicate the -- the criminal prohibitions in the statute as well. And I think that this statute -- I think you can see the extent to which this -- this case implicates the core of the secrets that the agency has. This Court in the Sims case described the sources and methods protected by the statute as the heart of the intelligence community.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Clement --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And this case involves both.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the -- the argument made by the other side, which seems to me has some plausibility to it, is that Totten was decided in an age when courts were not as flexible as they are today. We -- we have procedures for matters being kept confidential by courts. We -- we allow hearings that are closed in matters that never would have been done before. And since, the argument goes, the -- the only purpose of Totten was to preserve the secrets, why can't we preserve the secrets that way? If and when it turns out that the prosecution of this -- of this suit would require a secret to be disclosed, we will terminate it or -- but -- but up until then, why -- why decide in advance? Why not take a -- take a run at it and see?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, there's a couple of points to be made about that. One, as this Court recognized in Reynolds -- in the Reynolds state secrets context itself, even the provisions of going forward, no matter what innovations have been made, the -- the provisions of going forward and handling classified information necessarily involve risks that the information will be disclosed. In the first place, both Totten and the state secrets privilege itself are premised on the notion that the information, if it is in fact privileged, is withheld from the case. It's an absolute privilege. So the idea is not that you have some sort of limited disclosure to the court personnel and to the ultimate fact-finder in the case and that's somehow all consistent with the state secrets privilege. To the contrary. Once a determination is made that a matter is state secrets, there's no further disclosure of the information. You -- the whole premise of state secrets is not that you try to prevent ultimate disclosure to the general public. It's that once something is privileged, you -- you treat the matter as privileged and you take it out of the case.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you're not making that statement with respect to anything that's classified. There was something in your brief, reply brief, at 18 and 19 in which you -- you cite Reynolds and you say the proper response to classified information in civil litigation is to disregard the classified information, not to order partial disclosure to court personnel. Are -- are you saying then in all of civil litigation if information is classified, then it's just out of the case?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I think there can be certain arrangements in certain civil litigation where the Government can agree with a party to proceed -- as part of their overall agreement, to proceed on the basis of classified information, but that would involve a very different way of -- of proceeding than the normal default rules. And I think absent some kind of agreement for the Government to proceed in that way, the default rule in civil litigation has always been that the privilege is just that. It's -- the matter is -- the matter is privileged and it's taken out of the case.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. But you lose. I mean, if -- if that matter is necessary for your case, don't -- don't you lose?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely not, Justice Scalia, not in civil litigation. And that's why the state secrets privilege is, I mean, quite a remarkable doctrine in the civil side of the case.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're talking about civil only.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Only civil.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm thinking of gray mail. Certainly in the criminal -- criminal area, that isn't the case.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly right, Justice Scalia.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You either cough it up or you lose.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, and a different bargain has been reached in the criminal context, and in that context to ameliorate the consequence of the sometimes difficult choice of revealing classified information or proceeding, the Congress has come through with the Classified Information Procedures Act. That only applies in the criminal side, though.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I just want to ask one question. Don't they have a claim interpreted favorably to them that this has nothing to do with a contract, totally nothing? Okay? But there happen to be some rules over there in the CIA in their books somewhere, which we've never read, and they say when we use a foreign person as a spy, we'll pay him some money or we give him something. We have some procedures. Now, we don't have to do that as a matter of contract. We don't have to do it at all, but we do it. And so there's a claim here that we want to see that they're following their own rules. They say Totten doesn't apply to that because Totten is about contracts. Our claim isn't about contracts.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer, I have two responses to that. The first is I think the -- that the Totten doctrine extends more broadly than just the narrow confines of the contract.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it doesn't extend to torts, does it?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would -- I mean, I would need a specific hypothetical. I can't imagine a tort that by its nature --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, you go --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- depends on the relationship.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You go ahead. You go ahead.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I can't imagine a tort that depends on its very nature on the relationship. But we're talking about regulations that, as I understand the other side's allegations, are regulations for handling secret contracts. So unless one can allege that they were a party to a secret contract or at least a secret relationship, there's no point in that individual even being in a position -- they wouldn't even have standing to challenge the regulation.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so you're saying if in fact, when you look at those allegations, they're about regulations for handling secret contracts, it's about a contract, but if there were to be an allegation that it has nothing to do with the contract at all, it's just a way we handle retired foreign spies, Smiley for example, or someone like that. It has nothing to do with it, you see. Then could they -- what would be the rules then?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I still think the answer would be that there would be no relief under that circumstance because their -- their -- still their claim to having any entitlement under those rules at all would -- I mean, you know, total strangers don't have rights under those regulations. Alleged spies would have rights under those regulations, and the very idea of walking into court and asserting your rights as an alleged spy is inconsistent with the entire relationship and the contract that gave rise to it. I would also point you to the Weinberger decision, Weinberger against Catholic Action, because there this Court applied Totten to not force the Navy to produce an environmental impact statement even though there were regulations on the book -- and the concurring Justices focused on those regulations -- where the Department of Defense said we do produce an environmental impact statement even if it's classified. So I think on the authority of Weinberger as well, the very fact that there are internal regulations on a subject, the entire subject matter of which is secret, doesn't give rise to judicially enforceable rights. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the time for rebuttal.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Burman.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3430 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: First, with respect to the question about the due process rights below, I would note that the Government does not challenge, and specifically said so in footnote 2 of the petition for cert and footnote 1 in their brief on the merits, whether there is a due process claim here. I would encourage you -- and I will come back to the due process question if you're interested. I'd encourage you to look at the respondents' appendix, pages 72 to 74, where the CIA employee described the fact that there are, in fact, regulations that are not limited to enforcing a secret contract. That is not our claim.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But they are regulations that the -- that depend upon the existence of a spy-principal relationship --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Actually we don't believe that's correct, Your Honor. We believe that --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, are you claiming that your -- your people are -- were not spies?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We allege that they were coerced into that relationship, but we do --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, however got there --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- they -- they -- your claim is that they're spies and that, therefore, whatever your procedural claims may be, whatever your substantive due process rights may be, as I understand it, depends upon the assumption of a spy-principal relationship.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do not agree with that, Your Honor.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We believe that PL-110 allowed the admission of people essential to the United States without any comment on whether they had formerly been spies and that these regulations do not require us to prove as an essential element even to the CIA, much less to the district court --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that they were spies for the CIA.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- you don't have to prove that they were spies, but you have to prove that -- that they had a contractual relationship with the United States. And the only contractual relationship you're asserting is the relationship of a spy.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We disagree with that, Your Honor.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do not believe -- and in fact, the Ninth Circuit went out of its way to make very clear to the district court that if we try to plead around and base a claim on a contract, the district court should dismiss that.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, wait. What -- what is the basis on which you assert these regulations are applicable to you --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to your client?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- we say that the -- we believe we can show, once we are allowed to proceed -- and it's premature at this time to decide whether we'll be successful in this or not. We believe we can show that the CIA has internal regulations that say as to PL-110 resettlees, we will provide continued financial and security support in these circumstances, a need-based standard.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and the agency comes in and says, prove that you're a PL-110 resettlee.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The agency --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and what is your response to that?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The agency has never --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your response is I was resettled because I was a spy.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. We don't have to say that. We can say we were resettled under PL-110, which they have to inform at the time the INS Commissioner that they were bringing in people as PL-110 resettlees. They're not required to tell the INS Commissioner that they were spies, just that they're essential.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What if -- what if the Government takes a slightly different tack and -- and you bring your essentially PL-110 neutral claim, and the Government says, the only relationship upon which this claim can be based by these particular Does is a spy relationship? We claim privilege, and on the basis of that privilege, we -- we claim dismissal. What is your response to that?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that were an essential element of our claim, which we believe it is not --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they're not saying it's an essential element in the sense that only a spy can make a 110 claim. They're saying that the only basis upon which you can make a 110 claim is the spy relationship. You have no other. How do you respond to that?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Hence the reason we brought the case as Does. A procedure that was not known for that purpose at the time of Totten, that their own information officer and their brief and their position in Webster admits preserves the identity, preserves the secret. They acknowledge --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, look, you're talking about procedural means. I want to know what your immediate response to their claim of privilege is. Are you going to say we weren't spies?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The advantage of the Reynolds procedure is if they had made the claim of privilege, we would know what they were claiming was privileged.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They are making the claim of privilege on the ground that the only basis for your 110 claim is or can be, on facts known to them, that your clients were spies. Do you respond by saying, yes, we were spies, or do you respond by saying, we weren't spies?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We respond by saying we have an entitlement to a fair process within the agency, a confidential process --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let's assume that you have a really obnoxious court -- (Laughter.)
03-1395 +++$+++ 3466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that wants a substantive response, do you respond by saying they're right, we're spies, or they're wrong, we weren't spies?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If their position is that they can't confirm or deny to the district court whether we were spies --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They are claiming a privilege on the grounds that the only basis for your claim can possibly be the spy relationship based on facts known to them. In order to defeat that privilege, you've got at least to start by saying, no, we weren't spies and we don't claim to be. Are you going to say that or aren't you?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We are not going to say we were not spies. We are going to --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then I don't know why you're not out of court on Totten.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because we are not claiming the benefit of a bargain to be a spy. We are not seeking compensation --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is a PL --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You are -- you are --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is a PL-110 settlee?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ A PL-110 resettlee allowed the CIA and the FBI to bring in up to 100 people per year that were deemed essential to the U.S. They could have been simply very important scientists who wished to defect.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. So you would say this --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They could have been any --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are -- are you claiming that your answer to Justice Souter's question is we will assume for purposes of this case -- we're not admitting whether it's true or not, but we're going to assume we're not spies --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We believe --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- because we win even if we're not spies because we are essential persons?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If we had made the Totten mistake of suing in our own name, we would be out of court, but we have sued as Does and we have said we are satisfied with the CIA concluding internally whether we are entitled to PL-110 status.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right, but my guess is -- well, he's pushed you and it sounds like it to me -- that the only basis on which you could say you were an essential person is that you're a spy.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We don't --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He's -- he's not a scientist. He's not a --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Since they have not contested our PL-110 status until a somewhat desperate comment in the reply brief, we have never had to face this question because there has been no question that we are PL-110 resettlees, and that as long as we do not disclose our identity, which we've been careful not to do, unlike Totten, there is no state secret that is -- is at risk.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if the question comes up, you're going to have to disclose the identity. I mean, if -- if it is controverted whether indeed you're -- you're a spy or not, then what do you do? Do you say, well, we'll -- we'll do it in camera? That's right? I mean, you -- you think that -- that a United States district court has all of these security facilities available as Langley? I mean --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- trust me, it doesn't.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do not believe that we have to have -- that we have to disclose anything to the district court to have standing as Does to seek a fair procedure within the CIA. At the time of Totten, the idea of having a Doe being able to sue was not recognized for a plaintiff who wanted to protect his identity. We have that now as of the last --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we have to change Totten? Because, look, what I'm now thinking is, A, if you're suing on a contract, you win because you're a spy, if you win. If you're suing on promissory estoppel, you win because you're a spy, if you win. If you're suing on PL-110, you win because you're a spy, and if you're suing on due process, you win because you're a spy. So no matter what, you can't win unless you're a spy. Now, they -- they have Totten, and it -- it -- that sounds to me as if you're there. And do we have to overturn Totten for you to win?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I do not believe so, but you should not expand Totten in the dramatic way the Government asks. And it does not counsel for you to expand Totten when they cannot define a clear line as to where this jurisdictional, which they use in the brief but abandon here -- they cannot explain to you why in Webster -- they argued on pages 37 to 40 of their brief for exactly the same interpretation of Totten that they are arguing now. They specifically said that it should not be up to the courts to look behind the scene of the privilege in Reynolds, and yet the Court rejected that position. In Hamdi, they said there cannot be a secret proceeding with due process and the courts cannot review whether we've made that available, and the Court rejected that. Things have changed since the time of Totten. That does not require overruling Totten, but it certainly does not counsel expanding Totten in the dramatic way that the executive asserts, a way that basically says to the Court you have absolutely no role in determining whether our assertion that the state secret is an essential element here is in fact the case and whether it truly is a state secret. We -- if there's anything we ought to be able to decide it's what our case is about. We may have loosely used bargain in the complaint, but the district court and the Ninth Circuit have now made it very clear that we cannot have a contract claim, we cannot have a due process, whether substantive or procedural, based upon a contract, we cannot have a promissory estoppel claim. The Ninth Circuit has decided all of that against us. What we still have, though, is a claim to a fair, internal agency procedure.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Attached to what? I mean, you can -- a fair procedure leading nowhere is not a claim. You have a right to a fair procedure because it's attached to some substantive right.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's what we haven't yet had the opportunity to prove as to what it is in these regulations. But if you would look at -- again, at the respondents' appendix 72 to 74, the agency's witness that they voluntarily made available, did not make any assertion of privilege, did not make any assertion that this was confidential asked, are there agency regulations that you know of that relate to the resettlement of these PL-110 people who are resettlees from foreign countries? Yes. Are there regulations that deal with the determination of the level and extent of benefits to be given resettlees? Yes. And are there agency regulations that deal with grievances by resettlees? Yes. We think no minimal due process allows them to tell us the wrong standard and not to give us notice and an opportunity to be heard in a confidential proceeding --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You still have --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- what's your best case for that? What's your best case for that proposition?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, certainly Matthews v. Eldridge.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because it sounds to me like due process in -- in the air.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We don't believe it is, Your Honor. We -- we don't know for sure until we are entitled to litigate the regulation.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. We know enough at the summary judgment stage for us to -- to decide whether the case can go forward or the dismissal stage.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there has been no summary judgment --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Or dismissal stage.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ At -- at the dismissal stage, our pleadings have to be accepted as true, and we believe that the pleadings sufficiently assert that there are regulations there that create a -- a property interest and that --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3504 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That create a property right?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3505 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the property right is the contract with the United States. I mean, you can't get away from the contract by calling it a property right.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do not believe there is a contract and we do not believe we have to rely on it. We were -- the Does were coerced into what they did. They do not seek compensation.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is your strongest case? I don't think Matthews addresses it. What is your strongest case for the notion that you have a property interest even though you don't have a contract?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Probably Perry v. Sindermann in the sense that there was clear that the contract was over but the Court indicated that --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that was the firing of a school teacher. There was --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3511 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was a nonrenewal.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- there was -- there was an interest in having your job, contract property, and interest in getting back salary, contract property. Not this case.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- what the Court actually, I believe, focused on there and in Goldberg v. Kelly was the question of whether there were regulations --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Goldberg v. Kelly, welfare benefits, money.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We believe this is in a sense the equivalent of a welfare benefit.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Perry v. Sindermann. Is that -- that's the nontenured teacher?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There's no property right there, I don't think. I've always taught that as a ground that it wasn't compared to Roth where there was. All right. So -- so -- but there was a First Amendment interest of some kind.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I believe the Court indicated that it would be possible if there were practices and policies that had been established that set substantive standards for continuing that there would be a property right in a fair procedure for determining that internally at the school.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're probably right if they have -- I see what you're saying.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We also believe there is a liberty interest. These people came to the U.S. in danger. The mere fact of labeling them essential to the United States and bringing them in in the PL-110 status, taking away their identity, giving them a false identity, false references, changing their occupations, all of those things we believe -- we have an argument -- created a liberty interest in continuation of the protection. It's the special relationship, the Dushane-type argument that the -- that the Ninth Circuit relied on. But I would hasten to add it is premature to determine whether we win on the merits, and the Government is absolutely wrong in their brief in suggesting that unless we can prove at this point that we can win on the merits, that we don't have standing. We have standing to make a claim for fair procedures. Those procedures may include confirming internally to the CIA our identity and they may include confirming whether we satisfy whatever the need-based standard is that the CIA has identified. We have made every possible effort to comply with the covenant that Totten imposed in a contract, a contract that we don't believe we have. We sued as Does. We have sought preapproval of every single filing. We had -- counsel that learned any confidential information were precleared by the agency. That is not what happened in Totten. Those are procedures, as Justice Scalia has suggested, that did not -- were not recognized at the time of Totten just like the due process claim was not recognized at the time of Totten. And it is a claim that can be done internally to the CIA.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You think that Totten would be decided differently today because of the -- our due process jurisprudence?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We believe that Totten didn't know to make a claim other than contract.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- that's not my question.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, we do.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose Mr. Totten is here today.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if there were regulations in the Totten situation that created some sort of meaningful standard that would be applied by an internal procedure, which the record shows here the CIA has an internal procedure, not just regulations setting out the standard, but a review process. We simply want to have a fair, internal procedure. This case really is not about the protection of state secrets, but the limits of the executive authority to unilaterally assert without any review by the court --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How would the court -- a court go about monitoring this fair procedure --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We -- we don't believe the court would have a role in monitoring the fair procedure. It would simply determine whether the procedure that the CIA has described in the court record already satisfied minimum standards of -- of due process. If the court found that it did not --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And then you -- you said that -- suppose you knew what it was on paper and then you wanted to complain to a court, that's not what they gave us. They said that in their regulations, but they gave us something much less.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's possible that the CIA would assert that there is some reason that it gave less than its regulations that would be a state secret. It's hard for us to imagine what that would be, but in fact that is open on remand for the -- for the CIA to argue that.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do these regulations just set forth a procedure or do they set forth some substantive entitlement?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They seem to do both. They -- we haven't, of course, seen them in full yet, but they set forth a procedure and then they also say that there is some sort of need, age, indigency, and health-based standard for continuing the support. And if you'll notice --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then it will be worse for them. I mean, they say, look, frankly we'd rather reveal the names of one or two spies than we would like to reveal our procedures for dealing with the spies we bring into the United States. It will take someone who reads those about 15 minutes with a computer to locate 400 resettled spies. That will be a terrible disaster.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that was an external process, but we agree it should be internal to the CIA, that the process for applying that standard must remain internal to the CIA. The Does share the interest in protecting their identity and the identities of others like them. We -- we believe that the Government --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's your answer? What is your response?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That there's no external -- there -- there will be no public knowledge of that information, that they can explain their -- they can apply their process internally, apply the need-based process internally, and that will not be litigated in the courts if they assert executive -- or state secret privilege as to that, and we assume that they would at that point. But we -- we agree --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the court would say you don't have a cause of action unless it knows what -- what these regulations say. Surely the regulations have to be disclosed to the court at least.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We -- we believe that's the case and they have not yet said that it would hinder the state secrets at all to disclose them, and they have disclosed quite a bit and said that the remainder they are holding back only a need-to-know basis. They have not asserted any state secret privilege with the remaining regulations. And we know, in fact, from the letter that is in the record from -- between the CIA and the Justice Department in which the -- there was basically an understanding that there would be regulations like this in order to make sure that these PL-110 resettlees did not effectively become wards otherwise on -- on the Government and that the CIA would continue some responsibility for them. The -- we are not aware of any case in which this Court has suggested that there is an obligation of the district court to look behind the use of Doe and determine in a public manner the identity of the person. That -- the Government seems to assume that they have some entitlement to have a self-inflicted harm that they would demand that the identity of the Does be disclosed publicly and that they're entitled to do that. We do not believe that that's a required part of the use of Does. And in any event, we think it is somewhat similar to the criminal context where, if the Government is going to insist on moving forward in some way that is an affirmative defense like that, they may well have a responsibility for not being able to defend their position if they, at the same time, say that the state secret privilege applies. But at this point, anyway, that has not been presented to the district court. We -- we find it strange that the Government so quickly now says, unlike what it argued in Webster, that there is this type of contract which is not subject to the jurisdictional bar, and that is a contract with their own employees when they tell us that those same employees are going to know a much broader swath, as Mr. Clement said, of secrets. If their rationale made sense as something that was so compelling that the Court should create a jurisdictional bar for what the courts would otherwise have the capacity and the competence to do, you would think it would apply in that situation as well. But the fact is they lost Webster, and so they have to try to say that there is something still very broad about Totten but explain away Webster, and they simply cannot convincingly do that. Webster was the same argument by them. Reynolds was the same argument by them, and they lost.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May -- may I ask you what is probably a stupid question? Why isn't the contract barred by the statute of frauds?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we haven't thought about that because we haven't proceeded on -- on the contract. There may well -- we -- it probably is.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And there -- we -- we -- but we do not proceed on the contract. The Does, in fact, do not underestimate the risks of disclosure of their identities and of their relationship with the CIA. Perhaps they put too much into the complaint describing at some length what they did, but the reason for that, I suggest, is understandable. It was subject to preapproval by the agency. Why not put the equities in there even though they're not essential elements of your claim and see if the agency approves them? The agency approved them. We should not be thrown out of court because we put into the complaint allegations which the agency admits using the Doe, do not threaten any secrets, and which are not part of the essential elements of our claim.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are all of these what you call 110 resettlees -- are they all CIA resettlees?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does not appear that they are.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Some of them State Department and --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ At -- at least -- my understanding is at least the FBI and perhaps the Commissioner of INS at the time for -- perhaps at the request of other agencies. It appears that all three agencies had the ability to create this exception to the normal immigration procedure. If the Does can show on remand that the CIA's regulations are as they allege and that PL-110 status generally, which is what the CIA witness McNair basically said, that many PL-110 resettlees are in continued danger because of the nature of which we brought them in, regardless of what they did before we decided to bring them in, or if they can show that in their particular situation there is a -- a special relationship of danger created, we believe we would have a substantive due process argument and a procedural due process argument. That is not today's question. The Government has agreed that for purposes of today's question, it should be assumed that we can make out a due process claim. That claim is --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not quite sure where the Government has said that. You talk about footnote 2. All it said was that they're not appealing the point that you have to go to the Court of Claims.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And also in footnote 1 in the -- in their brief on the merits to this Court. I think it's on page 7. My reading of that is that they are not challenging the due process analysis, and it would be premature to challenge the due process analysis at this time, which is what the Court said in Webster. We believe that our due process argument is stronger than the due process argument that was made in Webster, but the Court in any event said that's not what is -- what is before us at this time. And -- and we believe that that's the same situation now.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you agree --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm just wondering what --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Excuse me. Do you agree your due process argument does depend on having either a property interest or a liberty interest?
03-1395 +++$+++ 3553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm just wondering what's, you know, some foreign -- I don't know who -- who the Does spied on, but let's assume -- you say they're in danger. Somebody may be interested in -- in the subject. What kind of security provisions do you have in your law office that would -- that would make them immune from the kind of intrusion that foreign espionage services --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In -- in general, we have not been allowed to take information outside of the agency. Even when we're in the clear --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not talking about the agency. Just about the name of your clients. I think it's -- there are countries interested in -- in, you know, who was spying on them.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That was their decision to trust us with that, and ironically under the Government's theory of this case, the Does --
03-1395 +++$+++ 3558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but it may lead -- it may lead to other agents and -- and one of the problems about allowing suits like this is that this information about who the agents are will be brought to a lawyer, kept in his law office, and much more readily accessible to -- to foreign powers than -- than it would be at Langley.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BURMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And under the agency's theory of this case, there is nothing that stops the Does from making their identities public because there is no enforceable contract that the agency can enforce. The agency wants to keep Snepp. It wants to live with Webster, and the only thing it has left is to somehow carve out a rule that applies to these people who have done everything they possibly could, including not telling me who they are. Our files within our office do not identify them in writing, is my understanding, by name. I certainly am not aware of who they are. I know what's alleged in the complaint and nothing more than that. But certainly the risk of gray mail, the risk of the Does -- people in the Does' position disclosing something is totally irrelevant to the question of whether Totten creates some sort of bar that applies not just to a contract claim but to a claim where there is no contract, where it is not alleged that it is based upon a contract, and where the parties have done everything possible -- the Does, the plaintiffs, have done everything possible to honor the confidences that the Government wants to keep. Thank you, Your Honors.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Burman. Mr. Clement, you have about 4 and a half minutes if you need them.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3562 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, just a few points. And may it please the Court, just a few points in rebuttal. First of all, as I think Justice Kennedy's question indicated, there was no waiver of any due process argument. If you look at those footnotes, the only thing that's waived is the Tucker Act concern that we talked about earlier. Second of all, I think in thinking about this PL-110 claim, it's important to acknowledge, as I think Justice Scalia was suggesting, that it is the PL-110 claim to the CIA. And as I understand their argument, it depends on their being a significant difference between coming into court and saying I'm an unacknowledged spy and I'd like to sue the CIA and coming into court and saying I am an unacknowledged PL-110 resettlee with a claim against the CIA, please hear my claim. I would say there's no material difference in terms of all of the policies that undergird the Totten doctrine between those two. And I would note that even the Ninth Circuit recognized at 35a and 37a of the petition appendix that the respondents would have to establish a relationship with the agency. The final two points I would make is, first of all, they would like to make some benefit of the fact that they are suing as Does as opposed to the Totten case. I would make two points about that. First of all, presumably the reason that William Lloyd could use his name in the Totten case is because it was a suit by his estate and he was deceased, so he didn't have a concern about retaliation. (Laughter.)
03-1395 +++$+++ 3563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would also say that the difference between suing under Doe and suing under your name just makes clear that both sides to this litigation start with the premise that the fundamental fact of this litigation turns on a secret. They don't want their name revealed any more than we want the name revealed, and that just underscores how this is all about a secret, just as in Totten. The last point I would make is they asked you to take their pleadings as a given at this stage in the litigation, and I would ask you to look at those pleadings. The complaint is replete with references to the espionage relationship, and the complaint itself cites Totten or the Totten doctrine no less than seven times. I would suggest that if this claim is not Totten-barred, then no claim is. With that, I'd ask the court below be reversed.
03-1395 +++$+++ 3564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. The case is submitted.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3568 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument in the case of Rousey against Jacoway. Ms. Karlan.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3570 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Yesterday in Koons Buick against Nigh, this Court emphasized once again that statutory interpretation is a holistic process based on common sense, that the reading of the statute should look at all the words to avoid a passing strange or an anomalous result when the text does not dictate it and the statutory history suggests otherwise.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That was a case I dissented in, wasn't it?

03-1407 +++$+++ 3575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I was a little bit surprised at your opening because it seems to me you have a strong textual argument you're now defending.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We do. A holistic reading of the text shows that section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What does a holistic reading mean? Can you stay within the --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- text and still be holistic?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not going to look outside the text at all. A holistic reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, which is on -- in the petitioners' brief at pages 1 through 2 --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What does the word holistic mean? (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it means read all the words in the sense that makes the most sense to you rather than plucking words at random or rather than looking at a word artificially. For example, when you look at a phrase like on account of in the Bankruptcy Code, as the Court did in North LaSalle, account means a lot of different things, but there it clearly meant because of, as it does in this statute.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So the antonym would be parsimonious or something like that?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it'd be partial, but I'm not sure.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, let -- let me ask --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- ask you this. The -- the statute does say that the right to receive a payment is on account of age, and that seems to me to be an argument somewhat in respondent's favor because the -- the payment has to be triggered by the age, if you read it that way, and it seems to me that's a fair way to read it.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, and I think payments are triggered by age because section 522(d)(10)(e) is a statute eminently about the protection in bankruptcy of retirement payments. For individuals --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the problem for the court below was that the person covered can ask for it in a lump sum and pay a penalty.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, and that's not --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and that isn't then on the basis of age. Am I right? Is that -- that was the problem the court had below.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, that's the problem the court had below. I think it's an illusory problem for the following reason. It's clear that the right to receive full enjoyment of payments under an IRA does not attach until one of the triggering events occurs. The trigger events are age 59 and a half, disability, illness, or for the estate, death. And that's the right that we're talking about here, and that's why --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, when you say full enjoyment, you -- you think when -- when I'm taxed on something, I -- I don't have full enjoyment of it? The only thing triggered by age, as far as I can tell -- the only thing triggered by age -- is your obtaining of a tax benefit. That's all. Once you reach a certain age, you can withdraw it without -- without paying the 10 percent tax.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, but the 10 percent tax here is designed and does, in fact, operate as a deterrent and a penalty.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'm sure it does, but -- but it's -- it's hard to accept the notion that simply because after a certain age I get a tax benefit, I'm receiving the money on account of my age. That doesn't make any sense to me.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, the way that I would view that is prior to age 59 and a half, you pay a penalty. And Congress put that penalty in there because the holistic sense, the full reading of section 522(d)(10)(e) is it is designed to protect retirement savings, replacement income of the elderly, the disabled, or ill people, once they get to the point where those triggering events, which are in 522(d)(10)(e), occur. Those are the same triggering events --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Ms. Karlan, the -- as long as this money was in the plan, it was shielded from bankruptcy, and there are -- there was not unlimited access even with the penalty when it was in the plan. One thing that I don't know and may be of some significance, did the Rouseys have a chance, even though they lost their employment, to keep their money in the plan where it would be shielded from bankruptcy or did they have to roll it over?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Northrop Grumman's policy is to require individuals who leave the company's employment to roll their pension plans into an IRA. The Rouseys tried to get work in Arkansas when they moved there. Had they gotten a job there that they were able to keep, which they were unable to do because of their health, they could have rolled that money back into an undeniably, completely exemptible.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Another employer's plan.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But they could not have kept it in this employer's plan?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. This employer did not permit individuals to keep the money in the plan. They were told they had to remove the money when they lost their jobs.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That was a term of the plan that it -- you can remain in it only so long as you're employed?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Apparently so.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are there any other plans that are -- are entities clearly covered by the statute in which the only effect of age is to enable you to avoid a tax?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Well, then --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me give you a couple --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- then you might persuade me.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me give you a couple of examples --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3611 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3612 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that I think will be quite familiar. A 401(k) plan allows you to get access to money before you turn 59 and a half on account of hardship, and you pay a 10 percent tax penalty if you do so. The Federal Government's thrift savings plan for Federal employees allows you to take a loan out of the plan and to pay the interest back into your own account before you turn 59 and a half, thereby essentially giving you free use of the money. If you don't pay the loan back, it's then treated as a -- as a distribution, and you pay the 10 percent tax penalty on it. So that if you read this statute to -- not to include IRA's, to deny exemption to IRA's, you read this statute to deny exemption to virtually all of the modern forms of defined contribution pension plans or savings plans.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3613 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. That was what I was going -- aren't most of the pension profit-sharing, stock bonus plans, and annuities similar to the IRA's in terms of allowing withdrawal on the payment of a penalty?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3614 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3615 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought they were all in the same boat. So what the effect of this rule is -- of the Ninth Circuit is that they would all fail to qualify --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, that's correct. You would render section 522(d)(10)(e) essentially a nullity.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, it's the Eighth Circuit. Excuse me.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3618 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. I -- I can see why you might have thought it was the Ninth Circuit. (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3619 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it might be wrong anyway. (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3620 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3621 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What is the percentage amount of the payments that are taken out of all IRA plans before people are 59 and a half?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3622 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in the Cilek case from the Seventh Circuit, which is cited in our brief, the court there cited statistics that suggested it was between 1.2 and 1.7 percent of funds in IRA's were removed early under the penalty process.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3623 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the -- the payment here -- it says -- the statute uses the word payment. So suppose you simply have an IRA plan but you don't take money out of it. Then is it exempt from bankruptcy?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would be because it's the right to the future payments and not just the present payments, Justice Breyer.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so -- but I'm trying -- what I'm trying to figure out is if a person were to take -- just reading it in English, it sounds as if a person were to take the plan out before he's 59 and a half and pay the penalty, that that amount that he took out would not be a -- a payment because of age, but one that he took out after he's 59 and a half and didn't pay the penalty would be.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Justice Breyer. But in order to protect the ability to take money out after someone turns 59, you have to protect the corpus of the IRA now because otherwise, when he turns 59 and a half, there won't be any money there for him to take out. And that's why the exemption extends not just to present payments, as the Third Circuit erroneously held, but also to the corpus when it is necessary for the support of the debtor. And I can't emphasize --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Ms. Karlan, let me ask something about that very point because the statute says that to the extent reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor it's allowable.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice O'Connor.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are you aware of cases where the bankruptcy court has said, well, you don't need all that money? That's a big plan. You don't need all that. We'll just let you deduct X amount.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Justice O'Connor. We cite a number of them in both the opening brief and in the yellow brief on pages 19 through -- to 20, I think is where we -- where we talk about --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can we take this concrete case? Hers was something over $12,000; his, something over $42,000.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What was the claim here as to -- was part or all of that -- it would be some $54,000.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The claim was all that all of that was necessary. If I could give an example that I think Justice O'Connor might find instructive here. When a debtor, for example, is 40 years old, they generally require turnover of the entire IRA because people have time to earn the money back again. When the debtor has other retirement savings, for example, in a case from Virginia called Abate, because the person also had a 401(k) plan, they were required to turn over the entire IRA. When a debtor is able to work, even if the debtor is in his or her 50's, courts will often require exclusion of at -- will also require turnover of at least part of the IRA. In this case --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what do the courts do if they say, well, my client might be ill or something like that? It seems to me --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if the client is ill now, they get to keep it --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. They -- they say my client is able-bodied now, but we -- we need something because -- I don't know -- there's a history of family illness or something.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There isn't a reported case that talks about the possibility of future illness as a reason of exempting the money.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's -- I'm trying to figure out how -- how -- what the theory is. Is -- you say I have a right to receive payments because of age. And you say, well, here I have a body of money and 99 percent comes out of it after you're 60. 1 percent comes out before. So it's very tempting to say that that corpus there, of course, is a body of money that you're going to have a right to receive because of age because the practical effect of the 10 percent is -- is -- stops the -- the younger person getting the money. So does the case then turn on that? I mean, suppose -- suppose it were a 3 percent penalty and 40 percent of the people took out the money before they were 60 or a 1 percent penalty and 80 percent did it. Then should I reach the other result? I'm just trying to think of how does this analysis work. What's the right analysis?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would say at the 1 percent and 80 percent of the people are taking the money out, it wouldn't operate really as a retirement plan anymore. But if I can give another statistic that might be helpful in thinking about this. 18 percent of the participants in large 401(k) plans who are under the age of 50 are taking loans out against those plans today.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What percent?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 18 percent in one of the surveys. And yet, those plans are undeniably, absolutely exempt under the bankruptcy --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they're taking out loans against it. They're -- they're not withdrawing the money.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but the loans because -- for example, in the Federal thrift savings plan, the interest is being paid back into your own account, it's essentially as close to taking out the money as you can get.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I still don't have your answer to the problem that bothered me at the first. How -- how do you reconcile your positions with on account of language? If the -- if your clients can take the money -- just take the money out of the IRA at any time, then why is it on account of age?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it's not the -- if you look at the statute -- and let me just work my way through it with you. It's the right to a payment under a stock bonus, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan on account of illness. And the question is what does on account of modify there. I think the most natural and sensible reading of the statute is a plan that is because of age, a plan that is because of disability, and the like.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you say that payment doesn't -- on account of doesn't modify payment.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't -- I don't think you need to read it that way, and I think the most sensible reading here, especially given that the statute --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I think the logical reading is that it -- it modifies payment.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I'm not sure that it does, but even if it did, Your Honor --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Holistic for me. What -- what does it -- what does it modify? I mean, if you had to diagram it, on account of goes to what noun?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, this is again -- I know you dissented yesterday, but this is a less than meticulously crafted statute.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I thought I was being holistic yesterday, to tell you the truth. (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. Okay.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- but what does on account of modify?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think what on account of modifies here is the kind of plan out of which the payment is coming.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where -- where is that noun?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There are a variety of plans, stock bonus, pension --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The right to receive a payment under a stock bonus, pension --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- profit sharing, annuity, or similar plan or -- or contract. It's a plan on account of illness, an annuity?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Plans --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why -- why isn't it a right on account of?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's the right on account of.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think you can read it either way and you'll get to exactly the same result. So let me read it the way that you've been reading it, which is if you want to protect the ability of people who have IRA's to withdraw money on account of age, you have to protect the IRA now or there will be no money in it for them to exercise their right to withdraw on account of age.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but -- but there still is a right to take payments at any time.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice -- Justice Kennedy, we don't believe --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so then you're -- you're --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that that's actually a right.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under that, you're giving the -- the language that follows it no meaning.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's what I'm doing here, and the reason I don't think that's what I'm doing is because this statute clearly refers to IRA's by name as one of the plans that's entitled to exemption.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But as purely English -- as purely English, I read it as saying it's a right. What is that right? The right is a right to receive a payment on account of age. That's the -- a plan. That's the right. Now, your argument, I take it, was -- is that yes, it's true you also have a right under certain conditions to take it without respect to age. So what we have here is a plan that gives you both kind of rights.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's a kind that gives you a right to take it with a penalty and a right to take it because of age without a penalty. And thus, the question is, is that kind of plan which gives you both kind of rights covered? And the language doesn't answer it. So --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But under Justice Breyer's hypothetical, that's just like a savings account.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, because the savings account doesn't have -- I mean, the savings account doesn't have the -- the penalty. Isn't your argument that you've got to read the right as meaning a right without penalty, because if you don't read it that way, then every one of these other retirement instruments is likewise going to fail? Isn't that your -- your strong point?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's your strong point.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. That's -- that's our strong point and we're sticking with it. (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. Right -- it's not a right if you have to pay a penalty for it.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. It's not a right, as we say in the reply brief, to park on the sidewalk because if you pay the parking ticket, you can park there.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I think no matter how --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's a good argument. I like that.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No matter how you read the statute, it's designed to cover IRA's, and any reading of the statute that ends up not covering IRA's will also not cover many of the other --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why didn't Congress just put in IRA's along with the other things?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They did, Justice Ginsburg. They did in the last line of the statute.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but that's sort of an oblique way to get it there. I mean, why didn't they put it together with the other string of plans?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, my best guess as to why they didn't do that is they started drafting the exemptions statute in 1973 and they enacted IRA's in 1974, so they stuck it in at the end of the list. That's my best guess.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What your -- what your opponents say is that the -- the thing at the end doesn't prove anything because they're willing to acknowledge that some IRA's can be so structured that you cannot withdraw until -- until you reach a certain age. And if they're structured that way, they would be covered. So you had to mention 408 in the -- in the exceptions. What's wrong with that argument?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what's wrong with that, Justice Scalia, is that all IRA's are designed and they're administered on forms that the Internal Revenue Service sets out and you buy the forms to allow for early withdrawal. So under their theory, there has -- there is not now and there has never been a single IRA anywhere in the United States --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that had that inability to take the money out subject to penalty prior to the age 59 and a half.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do -- do we know that? I mean, couldn't someone -- I -- I don't think this is a very plausible basis for construing the statute, but just as a technical matter, couldn't someone go to the bank or brokerage firm and say I want to set up an IRA, but I want the IRA to be, in -- in effect, like an irrevocable trust in which withdrawals can only be made on certain, specific conditions? And couldn't someone, using both the IRA mechanism and a State irrevocable trust document, create an IRA that would be as restricted as -- as the circuit suggested it might be?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't necessarily think so for the following reason. IRA's are off-the-rack products. They're a basic consumer product that 40 million people buy. People don't usually negotiate the terms. If you did negotiate the terms, though, here's the second problem. Anytime you deviate from the form that the Internal Revenue Service gives you, which also gives you these rights to withdraw early subject to penalty, you run the risk that your plan will then be held to be a nonqualifying plan under section 408 of the tax code. You then lose the ability to deduct the contributions going in. You then lose the ability to defer the payments on the income as it accrues in the account. Now, to answer the last part of your question, one of the things that has occurred over the last, say, 5 to 10 years is more and more States are passing laws that essentially protect IRA's in bankruptcy and out, as a matter of State law, from any attachment by creditors. Why do they do that? Because they recognize that IRA's are a fundamental piece of the retirement system today.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And some don't. And the -- and the State systems vary.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, but only four States offer no protection to IRA's from creditors as opposed to --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As opposed to how many who do?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 46 States offer some kind of protection. 23 States protect them without limit in bankruptcy and out. 6 of them protect them inside of bankruptcy using the State exemptions as long as the amount is reasonable and necessary for the debtor's support.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's what -- with the purpose that we're talking about now --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- if it's only 6 that, faced with a bankruptcy, would shelter the IRA.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. No. 23 of them would protect all IRA's. 6 would protect all IRA's if the money in them is necessary to the debtor's support, an additional 6. 6 more would protect all the money in an IRA as long as it was deposited 120 days or a year or 3 years before the debtor filed for bankruptcy. 3 of them will protect all IRA's up to a dollar amount. In Nevada, the dollar amount is $500,000. 8 States use, as their State exemption law, an IRA that -- a statute that has exactly the same language as the Federal statute. 6 of those State statutes have been interpreted by Federal courts to protect IRA's.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But here there was no choice of picking up on the State?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's a -- there's a weird anomaly in Arkansas, Your Honor, which is Arkansas law does, in fact, protect IRA's, but the Federal bankruptcy courts in Arkansas have interpreted that law only to protect the IRA up to $500 because of a provision in the Arkansas constitution, article 9, section 2, that means that you can only save up to $500. So any bankrupt person in Arkansas who wants to keep any money in his -- in his IRA has to elect the Federal exemptions rather than electing the State exemptions.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And one train that we didn't finish before. You were explaining that in this case the entire $55,000 -- that entire sum would be needed -- would be necessary for the support of the debtors.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. The bankruptcy court did not rule on our claim that it was all reasonably necessary because they decided first that IRA's didn't come within the meaning of section 522.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you -- that was your claim, and I --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How did you come to that conclusion, that the entire amount?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if you take, say, $55,000 and you ask what sort of annuity could you purchase when you hit age 59 and a half with that money, it will be an annuity that, I would guess -- you know, I -- I hate to do math in my head like this. I'd guess it would throw off a couple of hundred dollars a month in additional income. And so if you ask will the Rouseys need that money for their support, I think the answer is yes because their only other support --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well. Oh, yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- is Social Security and a $2,000 a month defined benefit plan that will never go up and against which their Social Security will be offset. So when they start becoming eligible, as Mr. Rousey is about to be, for Social Security, that defined benefit plan reduces their benefits. So if the Rouseys are to have an old age in which they can afford to live in any kind of reasonable circumstance at all, they need this money.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3719 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I go back and just nail down one lose end in -- in an answer that you -- you gave to my question, can you set up a kind of irrevocable? I assume clearly from what you say is that there is not only no statute, but no IRS reg or ruling to the effect that you can make your IRA terms more restrictive without jeopardizing your qualification.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3720 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I was unable to find one, Your Honor.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3721 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why didn't the Government come in here, just as a matter of curiosity? We don't have an amicus brief here from the Government, do we?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- no, we do not have one, and I don't --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Government has no position on the matter.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I don't think they've taken a position here. I will say that in Patterson against Shumate, they referred to IRA's in a footnote in their brief, I believe, as pension plans under section 408.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There -- they never go bankrupt, so the position they usually take is against any exemption from the -- (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- well, that's correct. The United States trustee may have wanted them to -- I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Ms. McKiever.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3731 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, may it please the Court: Pursuant to section 522(d)(10)(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor's right to receive a payment is not exempt unless two requirements are met. First, the right to receive the payment must be on account of illness, disability, death, age or length of service, and the right must come from a specified similar plan or contract. Because neither of those elements is satisfied in this case, the petitioners' IRA's are not exempt.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3732 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it -- is it the case that other plans that are clearly covered by the text of this statute also permit early withdrawal for certain reasons?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3733 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes and no, and let me explain that. Yes, they do permit withdrawals based upon certain factors. Those are enumerated based -- based upon each individual plan. However, they do not permit withdrawals for any reason at any time for any purpose.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not a single one of them.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not a single one of them. Now, of course, I've not read every plan ever created, but none of the plans that I have ever seen, as the specified plans, the pension plans, the profit-sharing plans, any of those, allow withdrawal for any reason at any time.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you'd say that if one of them did, it would also not be covered.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. It -- it is thought --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What -- what --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I take it -- in -- in answering Justice Scalia, I take it from what you didn't say that none of the -- we'll call them kind of the paradigm example plans are, however, as -- as restricted as the language in this -- this statute would suggest that it had to be if you read it in a -- in a very literal way.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There are --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, they're all a little bit sinful, at least, even if they're not as sinful as -- as you say the -- the 401 -- the -- the IRA is.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- that is correct. The -- there probably are plans out there -- once again, there are so many plans. And those are created by financial institutions, by employers, by different entities. So therefore there are thousands of variations of those.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, why? Okay. Once you're down that road, you have conceded, as you must, that a plan that says you get the money because of age but you also can get the money without respect to age in certain circumstances can be a plan covered by the act. Now, that's the kind of a plan that's right in front of you. So, therefore, literally it falls just as much within the language as the other that you want to say even though that is literally true, this plan is very different from the others in terms of the purposes of the act. That's what I would like to hear because to me, I'm not so moved by holistic as I am by purposes, which is part of holistic. So -- so the -- the point that I would like to know is why, since ordinary people think of IRA's as pensions -- I do. I think of it that way. I don't know much about it. It's designed to help in the future, help when you're old and sick. But there is this extra thing in it which you point to. So why, in terms of purposes is this different from the others?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is different because this is the only kind of plan where you can access the funds at any time for any purpose. It is also --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I know that, but -- but -- and you do it with a penalty. We agree about the facts.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3746 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3747 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I want to know why that difference makes a difference in a world where only 1 or less 2 percent of the people do access it before they're 60, 59 and a half.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3748 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because the right to -- to receive the payment, the right to access the money at any time exists no matter if it is exercised or not, and it does not meet the language of the statute. The statute very specifically --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3749 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. I -- you've missed my point and I'm sorry. I put you on the wrong track with my following up. I shouldn't have.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. Yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My question is we all agree that there can be plans where you can get the money not having to do with age, and they fall within the language of the act, and indeed, you say some are covered. But this one you say is worse than the others in terms of the purposes of the act, and that's what I want to hear why.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because there is no causal connection between any of the factors that are enumerated in the statute and the right to receive the money. And that is --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask this question? Supposing instead of a 10 percent penalty, there was an absolute prohibition, would you agree -- on getting the money before you're 59 and a half, would then that qualify?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3755 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely, yes, it would.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3756 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, what if there were a 50 percent penalty?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Clearly, there's a point at which it would qualify as a prohibition more than just --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what is it that makes it a prohibition? Is it -- is it because the purpose is to deter withdrawals, or it is that it becomes economically unacceptable? What -- what is the reason for drawing the line somewhere above 10 percent?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The reason for drawing the line is because at 10 percent, as the Eighth Circuit has stated in -- in the Huebner case, it -- it said that it's a minimal penalty. However, there is still the unfettered access that's available.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what is the purpose of imposing any penalty at all?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would assume as a disincentive to -- to withdraw, but it's clearly not a prohibition, such as the -- the parking --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But 50 percent would not be a prohibition and neither would 90 percent.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It would not be a prohibition, but it would operate more as a prohibition than 10 percent.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it's a matter of degree rather than a difference in kind.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Clearly that -- it's a very difficult line to draw. I -- I can't make that call at this moment, but --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me the easiest black letter rule is no tax or some tax. I mean, if it was totally free like an ordinary bank account, then you'd be dead right. But the fact that for a -- an important purpose there is a 10 percent penalty put in seems to me puts it into the category of things that are -- you're not supposed to have an absolute right to get.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the -- the hallmark difference here is that it -- it is the only type of account that you can access paying the penalty for any reason --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I assume --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- regardless of the specified reason.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that -- that your answer to Justice Breyer as to why that makes a difference with regard to the purpose of the statute is that the purpose of the statute is to make sure that people have money for their retirement, and that if you can withdraw it for any reason whatever, there is no security that that money will be there for their retirement; whereas if you limit the reasons to sickness and -- and a certain other number of emergency reasons, the chances the money will be there for the retirement are much higher.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that -- that's --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't that the answer?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if that's the answer, excellent. So now we have -- (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- let's say --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Scalia.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let's try -- let's try a million percent tax and nobody in history has ever withdrawn the money. Now, would -- that you would say would fall within this.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Fine, yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. Now, if that would fall within this, going back to Justice Stevens, because that operates as a bar to prevent the bad world that Justice Scalia mentioned, why doesn't a tax that operates as a bar that's good enough to stop 98.5 percent of the people from withdrawing their money and having nothing left for old age -- why isn't that just as good as the million percent tax in a world that is imperfect?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because clearly the -- the access of money and the ability to use it prior to retirement, just as -- as Justice Scalia just stated, that allows the -- the debtors to -- to access freely for any purpose, clearly not showing that -- that it would be for retirement purposes.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But attachment of the --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3783 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right, but it's acquired. Say -- say retirement, not old age. I mean, you know, 60 -- it's not that bad -- (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3784 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ 93.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if that is going to be your criterion, the -- the total freedom for any purpose, then why, if we accept your argument, why -- why don't we face sort of a daunting run or the courts face sort of daunting future? Because the -- the question then is going to be, well, what purposes are sufficiently close to old age to -- to allow for a continued exemption and how free may the purposes be before a plan falls into the IRA category. You told us a few moments ago -- and I'm sure you -- you were right -- that the kind of the paradigm example plans vary enormously depending on the terms in which employers set them up. So if -- if we say that the -- the dividing line is going to be between plans under which withdrawal can be for any purpose versus plans in which withdrawal is going to be somehow limited, then we're going to have to litigate an awful lot of plans. Aren't we?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not necessarily. The -- the line that we're really looking to is that there has to be a direct causation factor between one of the five specified factors such as on -- on account of factors, age, disability, death, length of service, and the right to receive the payment.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but typically these plans like 401(k) plans permit hardship withdrawals, and other plans that are mentioned in the act allow withdrawals for medical reasons or to buy housing or something like that. I mean, you -- we would just have endless cases trying to figure out what qualifies and what doesn't. It seems like such a hard line for you to try to draw here.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And every plan that I know of allows withdrawal if you terminate employment.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's typically --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In fact, that's what happened to these people. So I just don't see how your argument is going to --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the -- the ability to access the funds, oftentimes with termination, has to do with the length of service, the years in service because they accumulate and oftentimes are not payable at the full percentage. They're not fully vested until that time. Also, with the -- when there are multiple factors existing in the right to receive the payments, each multiple factor can be a cause of the -- of the ability to reach the money. When there are no meaningful factors imposed, though --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't it simpler to just recognize that these plans are covered despite the right to withdraw and then rely on the provision in the statute that only permits the deduction to the extent reasonably necessary for the support? I mean, that -- that seems to me a fall-back position that's provided for in the statute.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understand that -- that may appear to be correct, but the problem with that is that as -- taxpayer status is not the hallmark in this case of if it is or is not exempt. Therefore, all types of accounts, whether they are truly retirement accounts or -- or if they're just savings accounts, could potentially qualify under this statute. If -- if you want to open it up and -- and allow all kinds of accounts to be exemptible under 522(d)(10)(e), the problem is that there is no limit on what can be potentially exempt under that statute.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. Well, obviously, it's -- it's governed by the statutory provision that it has to be a stock bonus, pension, profit-sharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract on account of, and so on.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3797 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it includes IRA's apparently because of the last provision in the statute referring back to individual retirement acts under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3798 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The section 408 reference is -- does not in any way expand the exemption. In fact, it is a further condition to place on the -- the exemption. First of all, section 408 sets out only the minimum requirements for an IRA to qualify as a -- as a tax-favored plan. That --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3799 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ms. -- Ms. Karlan says she doesn't know of any -- of any IRA that did place a -- a restriction which would bring it within that exemption even though the ordinary IRA wouldn't be within the exemption. Do you know of any IRA, a single IRA that -- that has a provision in it restricting withdrawal?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3800 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely. Those are customizable plans. Any person can go into --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3801 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They can, but do -- do you know that there's -- there's one out there? I don't know --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3802 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I do know of several out there.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3803 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You didn't just draw one up for this case, did you? (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3804 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I did not create one for this case. No, I did not. But they -- they definitely exist. In fact, in the Andersen case out of the Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, the debtor had an annuity and prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition, she elected that she would only receive periodic payments based upon her age, and that was found to be exempt by the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel because that qualified. The payments were based upon her age, and it was then a similar plan because she could not access the funds at any time but only for the specified reason such as age.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3805 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was that -- was that an IRA that she had? It was an IRA?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3806 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My understanding is, yes, it was under section 408(b) was -- that's my understanding based upon that case.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3807 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me -- let me ask you. Maybe this is irrelevant, but were -- were these restrictive IRA's that you're aware of set up under those terms in contemplation of bankruptcy? If the answer is no, why would anyone so restrict his -- his IRA?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I do not know if that one specifically was, but no. These have not been set up through --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3809 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But why -- why would anyone do that? They're -- they're qualified without these restrictions. Why would anyone want to cut off his -- his rights to -- to withdraw?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3810 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Clearly to protect the money potentially for retirement and -- and just as --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3811 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, like setting up a personal spendthrift trust?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3812 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3813 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I want to make it tough so that I -- I will not be tempted to withdraw. Is that the motivation?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3814 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that would potentially be a motivation because clearly the money is there readily accessible at any time to -- to buy anything that the debtor chooses throughout their life. So someone who's 30 or 40 years old can liquidate their -- their IRA account, whereas with a pension or profit-sharing plan, they don't have that kind of access --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Should we put any weight on the title, on the name? I mean, I -- I can't but thinking it's an individual retirement account. Was Congress trying to fool people? (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was the Federal Trade Commission? Should they investigate? What -- I mean, the -- the -- I think of it as an account that's basically aimed, at least Congress thought it was aimed, at retirement, which has usually to do with age.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the -- the name is clearly not determinative. Also, Congress in the -- in the --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm reading the statute and if I were voting on it and put in the 408 reference and think of the word individual retirement account, is there any -- I would have thought, knowing not that much about it, that of course, they'd be included. Now, is there any indication, when people passed this, that they didn't think they would be? Any -- any reference in the terrible words, legislative history, that might shed light on it?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. First of all, Congress did historically reject, first of all, just tax-favored status overall, such as what an IRA account is. An IRA account is set up just for tax-favored status. Congress set forth, instead, the (d)(10)(e) -- 522(d)(10)(e) requirements that -- that are much more stringent in the requirements of the traditional IRA.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3820 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, are they? Because there was one statement -- I think it was in Ms. Karlan's brief -- that the Fifth Circuit said profit-sharing plans permit participants to withdraw up to the entire amount on payment of the penalty. So a profit-sharing plan, which was one of the ones on the list, seems to be substantially identical if you can also take out, whenever you like, as long as you're willing to pay the penalty.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3821 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a misnomer that that's a -- a right to payment. That is rather the right to borrow as a loan. And a loan is very different than a right to payment. They have the right to borrow the funds. However -- for example, in the New York Police Department pension plan, which she referenced in the reply brief, the police officers can borrow up to 90 percent of their pension plan funds. However, they -- as long as they're employed there, they have to continue to repay that.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What -- what if they don't repay it? What's the sanction?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is a 10 percent penalty. However, as the bankruptcy --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what -- where -- where would the -- where would the principal repayment come from? I assume it would come from deducting whatever the balance was from the -- the person's account.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That would be correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3826 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, we call it -- the -- the loan feature then boils down to a -- a withdrawal subject to a periodic repayment obligation, but if that obligation is not satisfied, the bottom line will be exactly like a withdrawal because they will simply deduct whatever the balance is from the person's rights under the plan.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Plus 10 percent you say.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. However --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it's just -- just like an IRA.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but this is in the bankruptcy context, which makes it completely different. The bankruptcy filing of a chapter VII bankruptcy is a picture in time. At the time that the debtor files the bankruptcy petition, you look to the assets that the debtor has possession of and the interest that the debtor has at that moment. There's also, for some things, a 1-year look-back period. But because it's a picture in time, it's what the -- the debtor can reach is what the -- the bankruptcy trustee looks to, the types of assets that -- that the debtor owns. This is very different than the pension plan which, of course, the debtor could not have -- have exhausted to pay the creditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, but any other type of account would be there, would be present at the retirement. But because they could have liquidated their IRA's to pay off their creditors prior to filing the bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee steps into the shoes of that debtor and has the ability to reach the funds that the debtor can potentially reach. There are other exemptions, of course, set forth in -- in section 522(d), you know, for a home or jewelry, but the assets that are not exempt are readily available to repay creditors, for -- for the benefit of the creditors. Therefore, that -- that makes it significantly --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Subject to the 10 percent if the bankruptcy trustee does that?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the penalty still has to be paid even if it's the trustee who takes money out to pay the creditors, on your view.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. Yes, they do. They do. Additionally, the petitioners' IRA's are -- by allowing unfettered access, are unlike any of the other plans because the petitioners' standard IRA is much more like a savings account. It's not any form of deferred compensation. They can't look to that to fill a salary void after they retire because the money may not be there. Unlike in the pension plans or a profit-sharing plan, they could have liquidated those funds prior to their reaching any age or any illness that -- that may befall them.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there -- there is no penalty attached to withdrawing from a savings account, and there's also no limit on the annual contribution.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. That is correct. That is correct. But the -- the key here --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me just get -- get straight what -- what the -- what the universe of plans we have in front of us here. Do you assert that there are no other plans, clearly covered by this statute, that permit withdrawal for any reason but with a penalty?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. None of the specified plans listed, the -- the ones enumerated.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would permit withdrawal for any reason whatever provided that a penalty is paid.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ None of them is like that.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ None of them is like that. They all have specific factors. There has to be a causal connection between the ability to access the money. Additionally, it's very important that -- that an account or plan that qualifies under the statute -- it has to be determined on a case-by-case basis. And there's no question that there are definitely IRA's that -- that could and do qualify for this exemption. It is, instead, that --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3843 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do -- do you disagree with Ms. Karlan that this is -- this is a standardized product so the people, the Rouseys of this world, really couldn't get a tailor-made IRA? They would have to take the standard product.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3844 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not -- that's not correct. There are many customizable products that are -- are out there. In fact, for example, when employers set up different kinds of plans for their employees, they go and they can choose from many different options. For example, they can choose if they even have a -- a loan provision built into a -- a 401(k) or a pension plan, just like the IRA. They -- they can be customized because section 408 only sets forth the minimum requirements for it to qualify for tax-favored status. That -- that is an Internal Revenue Code section, and it does not in any way prohibit additional factors being placed into the plan. Rather, it allows the -- the individual or the employer because some -- there are two different types of IRA's that can be set up by an employer -- to go and customize those so that they could potentially meet the statutory requirements.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3845 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ These -- these other plans that allow you to withdraw for certain reasons but not for any reason -- what happens if you withdraw for any reason?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3846 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3847 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is the sanction against -- I mean, you just go in. You withdraw the money for -- for a reason that is not allowed by the employer plan. What -- what is the sanction?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3848 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My understanding is that -- is that you cannot access the funds for a reason not allowed by those plans, that that is prohibited. And that -- that is similar to Ms. Andersen's IRA in the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel case. She could no longer reach the funds in the -- she could no longer reach the corpus of the account. The -- the lump sum of money was there for her retirement years. Whereas, in the IRA situation, the money is not protected at any time. There's no prohibition at all whatsoever on withdrawing the funds from the account other than the payment of the penalty. But whether an account or plan qualifies under the statute, it -- it -- you look at the language of the plan on a plan-by-plan basis. The petitioners' argument renders the terms of the statute superfluous because, first of all, it is dissimilar from the enumerated plans, and secondly, it is not on account of any factors that the money can be reached. The right to receive the payment is not based upon any factor other than the -- the account holder wanting to withdraw the funds.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3849 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The right to receive 100 percent is -- is dependent on a factor, isn't it?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3850 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, it is.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3851 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. At least as to the 10 percent that would be penalty, there's no right to get that money unless you have a certain age.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3852 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. Unless you have -- or another factor such as for education or for a home loan, something like that. There are several different reasons that you can -- you can reach the money and not pay a penalty. However, the penalty is not -- is not the deciding factor. It's their ability to access the funds at any time that -- that makes that a right of payment. It's not a right of payment without a penalty. It's just that the right to payment exists at all times.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3853 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You don't dispute that -- that it's a very small percentage of people who have IRA's, in fact, exercise the right to withdraw, given the penalty.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3854 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- that -- that is -- appears to be correct. I don't have those exact statistics, but yes, that -- that appears to be correct, that they have -- that they may not exercise that at -- in great numbers. First of all, going back to the causation factor about the -- the ability of the debtors to withdraw the funds for any reason or no reason, this Court in the 203 North LaSalle case determined that on account of must mean because of, and that -- that is a key point here because if the debtors can reach the funds for any reason, it is not because of any other factor. And in the LaSalle case, this Court found that that reading, the because of reading, absolutely applies to this section of the -- the Bankruptcy Code, that means that the result is that a direct causal connection is required between the right to receive the payment in the on account of requirements. In -- in this case there is no causal connection whatsoever between the right to receive the payments and -- and any of the factors enumerated in the statute.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3855 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The words, on account of, in this -- this statute are sort of unusual, no matter how you construe them, because really the payment is on account of the years of service or it's on account of a lot of things. You may become eligible at a certain time. It would be better if it said a payment for which you became eligible for one of these reasons because the payment isn't really on account of all of these things. You may get the same amount whether you're disabled or not depending on what the terms of the plan are.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3856 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. There are, of course, always some other factors, such as you have to first deposit the money, you have to become eligible. But once those barriers are passed, then -- then the right to receive the payment has to be at least -- one of the causes must be one of these factors. And it has to be enumerated in the plan. It cannot be for any reason, but must be an enumerated reason in the plan. And the -- with the penalty, only the avoidance of a penalty is based upon the -- the age of the debtor or the -- or any of the factors. It's -- section 522(d)(10)(e) is void of any reference to the tax status or to the right to receive the payment without penalty. It's only the right to receive the payment overall.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3857 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does your argument draw a ring around IRA's? It was suggested that if your argument prevails, then these other plans would be affected as well.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3858 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. McKIEVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Only to the extent that -- that they are not payable for any of the reasons enumerated in the statute. If -- if they are available for payment at any time for any reason, then -- then they would not qualify. But the specified accounts, so long as they're payable for -- for one of the factors and that there's a direct nexus between the right to receive the payment and -- and the factors, then -- then they would qualify for the exemption. It is not, by any stretch, all IRA's. It is just the types that -- currently that the petitioners would have or that people would have that would allow the access at any time for any purpose. So it's not that the trustee is looking to have IRA's not be eligible for exemption. It's just the types of accounts from which all the funds can be withdrawn at any time for any purpose. There are many qualifying IRA's that do exist, that can exist. It's just that people have set these up from standard plans allowing them access. Whether they access the funds or not is not the key, but the ability to access the money because it doesn't meet the statutory requirements. There are several IRA's, though, that can and do meet the statutory requirements. It's just that the petitioners' don't. The case law in the Eighth Circuit was well settled, prior to the filing of this bankruptcy, that for approximately 12 years, that the definition of similar plan or contract did not include IRA's such as this, and that the on account of factors had to be satisfied to claim this exemption. The -- the debtors knew or -- or potentially should have known that -- that their IRA's were likely not exempt out of Eighth Circuit at the time that they filed because of the way that -- that these had been construed for a long period of time. So that they could have set up accounts that did qualify for such exemption, but -- but they did not restrict their access in that way. Thank you.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3859 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Ms. McKiever. Ms. Karlan, you have about 7 minutes. You're not required to use it all.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3861 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm going to retire early. (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3862 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the first point is that there are two rights under IRA's: the right after age 59 and a half or upon death or disability or illness to withdraw the money without any kind of penalty; and there's a second little exercise, an entirely subsidiary right, which is the ability to withdraw money subject to a penalty earlier. The existence of that second entirely subsidiary, almost never used right -- and the statistic on this is in the green brief at page 23 -- means that the real essence of an IRA is it is a plan on account of age. The second point. As this Court said last year --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3863 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You don't really have a right to receive it on account of age. You have a right to receive it without a penalty on account of age.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3864 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, at the age of --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3865 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It isn't the right to receive the money that depends on your age. It's the right to receive the money without paying a tax.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3866 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's a right that's very important because let me give you just a mathematical example of the difference.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3867 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is a right that's important, but it's not what the statute says. The statute says --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3868 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The statute gives that right.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3869 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the right to receive a payment on account of, among other things, age.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3870 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you do have that right. You also have another right. But the existence of that second right doesn't negate the first right. The statute doesn't here, for example, as section 522 or section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code does, use the word solely to say you -- a plan is eligible only if you have solely the right to receive on this --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3871 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but it lists the other reasons: on account of illness, disability, death, age, or length of service. And -- and, you know, when you have a list like that, you would think that the right to receive the money for some other reason doesn't -- doesn't qualify. I mean, I would think that that's --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3872 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That might be your first thought, but then --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3873 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or -- or at least -- at least some other reason that isn't closely related to those.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3874 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, but I think even if that were your first thought, you would then get to the implication that many of the Justices have been pressing today, which is the implication of that for all plans is tremendous because all plans give -- well, I shouldn't say all plans, but I should say the vast majority of other plans, 401(k) plans, profit-sharing plans, and the like, do give you early access to your money, and that's valuable to you. That's why in section --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3875 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it true that none of them give unfettered access? They're all qualified in some fashion. Do you agree with that?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3876 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the qualification of hardship has been interpreted by many employers to say, you want to buy a house and you can't otherwise? That's a hardship. You want to sent your kid to school and you can't otherwise? That's a hardship. You have huge, you know, consumer loans and you could consolidate that? That's a hardship. So it's not as if IRA's operate differently from everything else in the system. That's why --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3877 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, yes. You -- you don't have to make up a hardship. You just say I want the money. Okay, you want the money? Here's the money.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3878 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that's --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3879 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't even have to lie about the hardship. I mean -- (Laughter.)
03-1407 +++$+++ 3880 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I need the money. I don't have the money. That's a hardship. If you -- if all you have to say is the magic word hardship, I think that's why we would say IRA's are similar plans or contracts because this Court has made it clear similar is not the same thing as identical. So if similar reasons allow you to withdraw, that's enough. And that's why in section --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3881 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In any of these other plans, can you get the money so long as you're willing to pay a penalty?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3882 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As I read the New York City --
03-1407 +++$+++ 3883 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Without any qualification for disability, illness. No. I just want the money. Give me the money and I'll pay you 10 percent. Is there any plan that works like that?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3884 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know, but the New York City Police Department plan appears to work like that. You can take the money out if you pay the 10 percent penalty.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3885 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Has any judge ever taken the view that -- adopting Justice Scalia's approach, that while you can't put the whole IRA -- exempt the whole IRA, but you can exempt 10 percent of it?
03-1407 +++$+++ 3886 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not to my knowledge.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3887 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At least you ought to get that much, it seems to me, under his -- his analysis.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3888 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. KARLAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We'd be happier with 10 percent than nothing, but no judge has ever read the statute that way. The second point is a point that comes out of this Court's decision last year in the Till case where the Court said, look, you want to pick a manageable line, a line that's straightforward and familiar. And here's one that I'll give you that comes directly from the text of section 522(d)(10)(e), which is you should hold that section 522(d)(10)(e) permits the exemption of all plans or contracts that qualify under section 401(a), section 403(a), section 403(b), or section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, which IRA's do. And this may have led to some of the confusion, I think, between counsel in this case, which is in the Andersen case, although Ms. Andersen was receiving money under section 408, it was not a 408 individual retirement account. It was, instead, under section 403(b), an individual retirement annuity. So there are, as far as we know, no individual retirement accounts, the things you put money into while the money accumulates before you're ready to retire and you transfer it into an annuity that are customizable. And indeed, for the kinds of debtors who need the protections of section 522(d)(10)(e) the most, the unsophisticated people who are putting their money away in an IRA because their pension plan either doesn't exist at all or isn't adequate for their retirement, the idea that they would understand to go in and negotiate at a bank for a customizable IRA strikes me as quite implausible. That's why we think the most sensible reading of the statute here is to exempt IRA's when the money in them is necessary for the support of the debtor. Thank you.
03-1407 +++$+++ 3889 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. The case is submitted.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3893 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll now hear argument in the case of Muehler against Mena. Mr. Phillips.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3895 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: At issue in this case is the safety of police officers when they attempt to execute a search warrant in an inherently unsafe situation.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3896 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask one preliminary question, Mr. Phillips? Do we have before us here any question at all about qualified immunity?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3897 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we do believe that a qualified immunity issue is bound up with the underlying merits. It was addressed that way by the Ninth Circuit because --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3898 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it wasn't -- it wasn't in the questions --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3899 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This Court --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3900 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- on which we granted cert?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3901 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This Court in Procunier treated the qualified immunity issue as part and parcel of the underlying merits of the case and -- and, in fact, skipped over the question of what 1983 meant in order to address the qualified immunity issue. And presumably --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3902 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How -- how --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3903 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the Court could do the same thing here.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3904 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do we do it? It goes right to the heart of this from you, the qualified immunity thing, for the reason that if you look at the facts and circumstances, it sounds to me like a somewhat close question as to whether the police did or did not exceed the reasonable bounds -- reasonable bounds. Now, if it's a close question, you have a jury verdict against you, and -- and then I think, well, yes, but I begin to come -- become disturbed if I think of qualified immunity. I mean, it isn't that clear. So -- so having read through the thing, I -- I preliminarily start by thinking, well, it could have been excessive force, I mean, given -- you know, I'm using that in quotes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3905 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3906 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The jury said it was. Who am I to say it wasn't --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3907 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I mean, this -- this --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3908 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in that situation? But qualified immunity. So now, what do I do?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3909 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in the first instance, it's reasonably clear to me that you're not bound by the jury's determination here. This Court has already --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3910 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- don't we have to give any weight at all to the jury finding there or --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3911 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With respect to the historical facts of the case, who did what to whom, of course, you have -- that -- that's subject to clearly erroneous review. On the issue of whether or not the conduct at issue here is reasonable, that's an issue of law or at least a mixed issue of fact --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3912 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, a lot of it may depend on the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3913 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- and law that this Court has decided as de novo.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3914 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- on the music as to handcuffing and what did they say and what was the atmosphere and what was the garage really like and how risky was it that there be gang members in the outhouses and -- and all kinds of stuff that you might sense from the testimony.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3915 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it seems to me that -- Justice Breyer, that the answer to all of those questions go to the core of what it means to exercise unquestioned command of the situation, which is a pure legal standard that this Court adopted a quarter of a century ago in Michigan v. Summers. And that's a question of law. To be sure, there are lots of elements of it, but what my position would be -- and obviously the officers' position in this case -- is that in exercising unquestioned command, you can accept all of the facts as you've just described them and none of that is excessive because it doesn't expose anyone to anything other than what is necessary in order to achieve complete control under the circumstances in order to ensure the protection of the individual officers and -- and candidly of the other individuals who were being -- being detained, all four of them, under these circumstances.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3916 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Have you responded to my initial question? Have you said all you want to say about qualified immunity?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3917 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice O'Connor. My -- my basic answer to that is that this Court already addressed that issue in Procunier. It considered that the qualified immunity issue was part and parcel of the issue, even though it hadn't been presented in the question presented, and indeed, I think in this case it's actually a -- a stronger argument that qualified immunity is in this case because that is the way that the Ninth Circuit specifically addressed the issue. It looked at under Saucier. It evaluated whether or not qualified immunity was appropriate and -- and did the two-part test, the first part being whether it was a constitutional violation and the second part whether or not it was reasonable under these particular circumstances. So if I -- if I cannot persuade you that this is constitutional, which obviously I -- I hope I can do, it seems to me absolutely unquestioned that there -- that what the officers did here under these circumstances were perfectly reasonable.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3918 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what is the -- what is the function of a jury in this case? What does the jury verdict stand for? And the jury doesn't return a special verdict and says we find X, Y, and Z. It finds whether the police exercised excessive force, and that's all we know from the jury verdict. Other -- I think what you're saying is that these cases should go off on summary judgment or even a demurrer. You assume all the facts as the plaintiff alleges them and then the Court decides whether that adds up to unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3919 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I'm not saying that that would be true in all cases. I do think in this particular case you did not need to have a jury verdict. We would have been prepared to stipulate to the facts as they were found ultimately and -- and giving the benefit of all of the inferences to the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3920 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't know the fact -- what facts were found because all we have is in the jury verdict that this was excessive force. Period. That's all.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3921 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's just a conclusion of law, Justice Ginsburg. So the -- the facts that you know are the facts as they're described --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3922 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's like was --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3923 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- by the respondent's brief.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3924 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the defendant negligent. Is that more or less a conclusion of law? We don't know in what respect from the jury verdict. And here, were these police officers acting -- did they use excessive force.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3925 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we know precisely what they did. They kept her in handcuffs throughout the duration of the -- of the search. We know that. There's no -- there are no additional claims as to having mistreated her physically.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3926 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wasn't there a fact issue as to whether she was handcuffed for -- even for a short period after the search had been completed?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3927 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think there is a factual question like that because I don't think that question was presented to the jury, and it was certainly not the basis on which the Ninth Circuit affirmed the jury's verdict in this case. There -- there was never an argument made to the jury that this -- that this extended beyond the -- the period of the end of the search. The argument that was made to the jury was that the search should have -- should have been limited to the room where the suspect was -- was a resident or that the police should have made a decision somewhere in the -- before the end of the 2-hour search that she was no longer a threat to them. And then they were arguing that -- that it even went a little further in terms of the timing of it. But they never asked the jury to find that that 15 minutes was the basis for a Fourth Amendment violation in its own right.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3928 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if -- but if it made a difference as a matter of law, what -- what should we assume about that extra 15 minutes? Do we assume that they found the facts in the way that the -- a plaintiff argues them or that you think they are?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3929 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think if the jury had been asked to make that finding, that you -- and -- and the jury determined that there -- that it was unreasonable, then I think you'd have to conclude that the 15 minutes were, in fact -- that it did, in fact, go beyond 15 minutes. I do think there is still a legal issue as to whether that's de minimis under the circumstances. But -- but I agree. I mean, obviously there is a role for the jury's findings, and you have to give them a certain amount of respect. But on the core questions of reasonableness and suspicion and whether or not the police exercised unquestioned command and what those terms mean, this Court has already decided that in the Fourth Amendment context it has to decide those issues as a matter of law to regulate the conduct of all police officers and not simply do it on the basis of whatever a particular jury would say in a particular circumstance.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3930 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, in doing it as a matter of law here, should we give consideration to the fact that in this case, if -- if I remember correctly, one of the officers testified that had they followed normal protocol, once they had, I think his phrase was, secured the building, the -- the main building --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3931 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the -- all of the grounds actually.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3932 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that the whole compound?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3933 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3934 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that they would have -- they would have taken off the immediate restraints, and he wasn't sure why they didn't. We -- do we -- do we consider that when we're crafting our statement of law as -- as to what is or is not excessive?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3935 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think if this Court could determine that, as a matter of course, the -- the standard operating procedures in a particular way, that might certainly inform the Court's Fourth Amendment analysis. That -- I think what's important to keep in mind in this context, though, Justice Souter, is we're talking about four individuals who are being detained under these circumstances, and each of them poses a distinct issue for the police officers under the -- under -- when trying to decide how best to proceed. One of them had been found with marijuana in his possession. One of them had been determined to be an illegal alien, and the other two were individuals about whom the police knew virtually nothing. So, you know, is it possible that police procedure, generally speaking, when you're talking about a single occupant of the residence, oftentimes concludes that he can take away -- you can remove the handcuffs? That may be, although I don't think there's much in the record here to -- to reflect that. But what the police said here -- and I think it's extraordinarily important. Officer Muehler testified that if something had gone wrong, if either a police officer had been injured or one of the occupants of that house had been shot or otherwise harmed as a -- in the context of executing the search warrant, the first question that would have been asked is what was the least that could have been done to prevent those injuries from occurring. And he said to himself and he said it quite rightly -- and it's a rule this Court ought to embrace under the unquestioned command theory of -- of law -- is that if we keep them in handcuffs through the duration of a reasonable search, we will make our way through the search much more rapidly, much more efficiently in order to minimize the detention and we will eliminate -- and I mean, literally eliminate -- the entirety of the risk either to the individuals themselves, the occupants, the detainees, or to the police under these circumstances.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3936 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. I take it you obviously don't want us to -- to come down with a kind of a finicky version of -- of excessive force as the touchstone, and I take it you don't want us to come down with simply a blanket rule saying that essentially the police can do anything in -- in restraining occupants so long as it is not wantonly cruel. Somewhere in between. Do you have a -- a statement that would be the kernel of the holding that you want?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3937 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm -- I'm quite comfortable with the way the Court analyzed it in Michigan v. Summers, that the officer is not required to evaluate the extent of the intrusion to be imposed by the seizure. That is, you -- you have a categorical rule that allows you, in the ordinary course, to do whatever is reasonably necessary in order to --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3938 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But in the facts there, there were no handcuffs. He -- he was just detained. So --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3939 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand that, and -- but my -- my position is that handcuffs don't materially affect the detention under these circumstances other than to assure what the Court said, which is unquestioned command of the situation.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3940 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- I mean, I don't -- would -- would you say handcuffs are per se lawful for -- for purposes of applying Summers?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3941 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but it's important to put that in context because Summers is a narrow exception to the -- not an exception. It's a narrow circumstance under the Fourth Amendment. You have to have a search warrant. It has to be a validly issued search warrant so that we know that there has either been a crime that's likely to be taking place in the premises. It only -- it only extends to the residents, occupants of the house, and it's only when the search is for contraband, not just for any evidence. So, for instance, when the police go the 60th time to Michael Jackson's estate to go try to find evidence of whatever is going on there, I don't think it's reasonable to go in and handcuff Michael Jackson and anybody else who happens to be on site.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3942 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it doesn't -- why is contraband magical? Wouldn't -- wouldn't your point be when -- when the reason they're investigating gives cause to believe that there may be physical danger --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3943 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3944 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- from letting people wander around?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3945 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- absolutely.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3946 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which is the case with contraband, but would be the case for many other reasons as well.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3947 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think the important point here is that we're talking about guns. These are gangs. These are guns. This is a circumstance that is inherently more dangerous than any other circumstance the police are likely to confront.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3948 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But would you be happy then with a holding that says just what you said? We reaffirm Summers and -- but Summers said special circumstances or possibly a prolonged detention might lead to a different conclusion in an unusual case. And the only verdict part that I think we're concerned with here -- it was not about four people. It was one person, Iris Mena, and in respect to Iris Mena, the jury found that there was a violation of her -- of her Fourth Amendment rights. And as to her, you could have found -- you said -- I don't know if you misspoke. You said it could be more than 15 minutes. In looking at it, I was certain whether they kept her for 15 minutes more or more than 15 minutes more, maybe up to an hour more beyond the time that the search ended and kept her in handcuffs, both after the time they had secured the place and also after the time the search ended. Well, that would seem a basis for the jury's verdict and consistent with Summers.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3949 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- it could have been a basis for the jury's verdict if they had, in fact, put the issue of whether or not they were detained --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3950 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Mr. -- Mr. -- but may I point out that the judge's instructions did put that issue to the jury at page 203. A police officer is required to release an individual detained in connection with a lawful search as soon as the officer's right to conduct the search ends or the search itself is concluded, whichever is sooner.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3951 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. That -- I understand that, Justice Stevens, but the point we made in our reply brief is there's not a shred of evidence in this record and it was never argued to the jury that this search -- that -- that her detention lasted beyond the period of the search in this case. Indeed, counsel for the police officers specifically said in his closing argument, there is no issue but that she was released at the time of the -- that when -- as soon as the search was -- was ended, the -- the warrant was executed.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3952 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I wonder why the judge gave this instruction then.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3953 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because -- because what he's -- well, you know, it's a reasonable instruction.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3954 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And why -- why there was -- there was a special verdict of sorts, not a detailed one. But the two questions, question 5 and question 6, on page 255 of the joint appendix --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3955 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3956 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ One question concerns whether the force was excessive, and the other one is, do you find that she was detained for a longer period than reasonable? Those two questions -- my first is a procedural question. Did counsel for the defendants object to the jury getting -- those two questions being submitted to the jury?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3957 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Ginsburg. We didn't. And -- and --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3958 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it seems to me that the judge is asking the jury in these questions, one is whether there was a -- a detention, was force greater than was reasonable under the circumstances, and whether the duration was longer than reasonable under the circumstances.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3959 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. Justice Ginsburg, you have to put that in context. The argument of the plaintiff in this case was that the detention should have ended at either of two points: after they had completely cleared the area and made it safe, or alternatively, at some point after that when they had asked her questions and determined that she had no particular involvement with Mr. Romero. Their argument was anything after that was unreasonable, and that's what the jury certainly found, was that that was the reasonable break point. Our argument is that's not consistent with the notion of unquestioned command and -- and is wrong as a matter of law. And there is no evidence -- no evidence. There was no testimony that she was kept for a period beyond the execution of that search warrant. It's very important to understand that.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3960 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you're saying that the -- the mere fact that it -- it went to the jury, even went to the jury without your objecting to it, does not mean we have to listen to what the jury said. Is that -- is that --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3961 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. If it's wrong as a matter of law, that's -- then that's absolutely right. But there was no evidence in this case that they kept going. The only thing he said was, he -- he didn't remember. That was -- the question was put to the police officer. Was she kept beyond there? He said he didn't remember. He wasn't even the police officer who was involved in it. There's not a shred of evidence of that. It's totally made up. It wasn't their theory of the case in front of the jury. I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3962 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You might save your time. Yes. Mr. Shanmugam.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3964 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: When executing a search warrant to investigate a violent crime, officers may routinely use reasonable restraints on detained occupants in order to exercise unquestioned command over the situation and to facilitate the orderly completion of the search. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that the officers' use of handcuffs in this case violated the Fourth Amendment. Under the standard for excessive force claims first articulated by this Court in Graham v. Connor, as informed by this Court's decision in Michigan v. Summers, the degree of force used here was not excessive. The same considerations that justified the detention of the occupants in Summers, most notably, the paramount concern of ensuring the safety of the officers and the occupants themselves, will ordinarily justify the precautionary use of handcuffs during the detention.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3965 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then this case should not have gone to the jury on the basis of what you said --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3966 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3967 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- because you -- you just said that this -- the handcuffs -- the circumstances -- the circumstances here were reasonable as a matter of law.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3968 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, that's correct. It is our view that as a matter of law, the officers would have been entitled to prevail on the constitutional issue with regard to excessive force. And it's worth noting, I think, that the officers did move for summary judgment. They also orally moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence, and that motion was denied. Now, we also believe that the jury, quite frankly, was given insufficient guidance on the excessive force issue, and to turn to the jury instruction cited by Justice Stevens at page 203, it's quite clear that the jury only received one very general instruction on Summers detentions.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3969 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- well, has the -- the objection to the instruction been preserved here?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3970 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Perhaps an argument could be made that it's fairly included within the questions presented. There was an objection made at trial and an objection made before the Ninth Circuit as well, but our fundamental position is that the jury was simply given insufficient guidance on the excessive force issue. This instruction --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3971 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But on the -- on the question whether they preserved the issue, I -- I took it, implicit in what you said a minute ago, that yes, they did not object to the submission of the question. They did not object, in effect, to an instruction or giving of an instruction as such.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3972 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3973 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But they -- they had moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence, and that's enough to preserve the issue?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3974 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that's true. It is true that they didn't object to the specific special verdict set of questions. I think they proposed slightly different language. But ultimately I think our primary submission is that as a matter of law on these facts, no constitutional violation occurred.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3975 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ When you -- is your objection that the jury wasn't given enough guidance on excessive force, or is it that the -- that the ultimate issue of excessive force is not a jury issue?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3976 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We would concede, I think, Justice Scalia, that the issue should go to the jury where there are disputed issues of historical fact. We would submit that there are no relevant --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3977 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but is -- is excessive force an issue of historical fact any more than -- than unreasonable search or unreasonable seizure is an issue of historical fact?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3978 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there are certain --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3979 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's historical fact how long you held the person, whether the person was in handcuffs, but the ultimate question was, you know, is this force excessive. Is that any different from the question as -- of was this seizure unreasonable? If you submit the one to the jury, you may as well submit the other.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3980 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, those facts may be disputed in a particular case. We would submit that they really weren't disputed here, but there may actually be a dispute where the officers would say, yes, we used handcuffs and the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3981 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So when --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3982 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- or no we didn't use handcuffs.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3983 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- when you know all those facts, you're willing to send it to the jury to say, given all of these facts, it's up to you to decide whether unreasonable force was used or not.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3984 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We believe that it is --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3985 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's not a matter of law.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3986 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- a mixed question of fact and law, and once the historical facts are established, it is essentially --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3987 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why -- why any more so -- why any -- any more so than -- than whether it's an unreasonable seizure?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3988 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we would submit that it is no different from the question whether officers had probable cause or reasonable suspicion on any given set of historical facts which this Court held in Ornelas was a question subject to de novo review, over your dissent, admittedly. And we believe that the primary rationale for the rule in Ornelas also applies here, namely that officers do need to have a consistent set of substantive guidelines by which they can judge the validity of their conduct.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3989 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are -- are you saying that the only basis on -- on which the jury could have ruled for the homeowner here, the -- the respondent, is that she was handcuffed for too long?
03-1423 +++$+++ 3990 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We believe that that certainly is the primary issue that was at stake. And in fact --
03-1423 +++$+++ 3991 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think you have to say that. Otherwise, we have to uphold the jury verdict, if we can assume that the jury might have thought, well, you know, the handcuffs -- the police had a right to do that, but she was held too long, she was -- they -- they yelled at her, she was taken into a -- a place that was uncomfortable. If -- if that's true, then we have to sustain the jury verdict.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3992 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that the handcuffing was the key factor at trial, and I think that the best evidence of that, quite frankly, is that respondent in her proposed instructions referred only to handcuffing in her excessive force instruction. Unfortunately, that's not part of the joint appendix. It is part of the record.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3993 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. But the instruction that was given -- and one was read that's in the briefs -- it seems to me a -- a perfectly good instruction.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3994 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that that's true, but I think that the instruction didn't really provide any guidance on excessive force specifically. It was really an instruction with regard to the reasonableness of the detention more generally, rather than with regard to excessive force specifically. It was not a Graham v. Connor type instruction.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3995 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, then it seems to me it was the plaintiff's obligation to submit a clarifying instruction and to bring this -- the denial of that instruction here.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3996 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there were objections to the instruction below, and all I can say is that perhaps an argument could be made -- and perhaps Mr. Phillips will make the argument on rebuttal -- that it is fairly included within the questions presented.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3997 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know how you can -- you can say that the only thing that was before the jury was the handcuff when the -- there was evidence that she was treated very roughly in -- in the first instance, she was woken from her sleep, she wasn't told that they were police, she thought they were robbers, and she feared for her life. That doesn't drop out of the case and what the jury was asked to determine.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3998 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, it was the primary issue before the jury, and to be sure, there were other issues. I think that the other relevant use of force was the initial detention at gunpoint, but -- and those -- and I would add that those are the two factors on which the Ninth Circuit relied in affirming the jury's verdict. Our submission is that both with regard to the initial use of force and with regard to the continued use of force, the justifications of Graham v. Connor support the officers' use of force in both instances.
03-1423 +++$+++ 3999 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but may I just ask a sort of very basic question? One of the instructions reads, a detention may be unreasonable if it -- if it is unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or if it involves an undue invasion of privacy. Now, are you telling us that you think the answer to that question is a question of law that the judge should provide rather than the jury?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4000 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Assuming that that instruction is correct -- and that might very well be a valid instruction --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4001 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it was correct.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4002 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It may very well be a correct instruction --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4003 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4004 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- with regard to a challenge to the manner of the detention itself. In that instance, then the jury does have a certain amount of leeway, but I think even then the teaching of Ornelas --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4005 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then it's not a question of law. The answer to whether it was unnecessarily painful, degrading, prolonged, or involved undue invasion of privacy, is that a question of law or a question of fact to the jury?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4006 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is a mixed question of law and fact, and the jury's job is --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4007 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's a mixed question?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4008 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The jury's job is to -- to resolve the underlying factual issues and then --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4009 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I understand the historical fact, but I'm -- I'm questioning you about the conclusions that you draw from the unreasonableness, degrading, and so forth. Is that partly to be decided by the jury or entirely by the judge?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4010 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We believe that that actually is ultimately a judge issue in the same way that the issue of whether or not probable --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4011 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So this instruction should not have been given.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4012 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHANMUGAM +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4024 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where -- where is that testimony?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4025 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The testimony -- Officer Brill's testimony? Is actually -- they cite joint appendix number -- on 75 where he says he doesn't recall. On the next page, in joint appendix number 76, he's asked -- they continue to ask the question. And isn't it your memory that about 10 or 15 minutes after that, Iris Mena was released? That would sound consistent. And that's 10 or 15 minutes after 8:57. In addition, Ms. Mena testified that she was kept between 2 or 3 hours, and that was actually consistent with prior testimony by the videographer herself, who testified in deposition and was impeached at trial, that it was 2 or 3 hours that the search lasted. The -- the point being -- and if you take the distance between Officer Muehler's testimony and Officer Brill's testimony, Ms. Mena was -- was kept in handcuffs at the end of a very long detention in handcuffs, for a period of approximately 27 to 33 minutes, if you don't even take Ms. Mena's testimony into account. And one of the ironies of the case is that there's testimony that Mr. Romero, the actual target of the case, was released at 8:45 at the time the search ended. And so while this --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4026 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But not from these premises.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4027 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. But in fact, this was a -- the search warrant was for two premises. He was picked up at his mother's house. And in fact, Officer Muehler had -- was -- was to radio the start of both searches, and so there was --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4028 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the -- the -- I thought that this poorhouse, or whatever it was called -- that the warrant covered weapons that were there.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4029 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4030 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That they were looking for weapons.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4031 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They were looking for a gun.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4032 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They were not looking for a gun at Romero's mother's house, were they?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4033 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4034 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did they have a warrant, a search warrant?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4035 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the warrant covered -- I think they were looking for the gun wherever it was found, and -- and the -- I believe the warrant --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4036 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, this was a -- this was a pretty extensive search warrant that they had.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4037 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4038 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did they have something like that, the same kind of warrant for the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4039 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's the same warrant I believe, Your Honor, in terms of -- we don't have -- there's not a lot of information in the record about --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4040 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, wasn't -- I thought that this warrant referred to a particular address, a particular house, not -- not any house where one might find Romero.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4041 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no. It -- it referred to the two houses, one on Cimmaron.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4042 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, was the other house his mother's house?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4043 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. The location number one is his mother's house, 2646 Cimmaron, and that's -- and Officer Muehler and this team was in charge of both of these searches pursuant to the same warrant. They had information that -- the reason they did that is that they had information that -- that he lived in this poorhouse, that he rented a room from the Menas at the poorhouse, and that he also visited his -- his mother from time to time.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4044 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then that would make it even more curious if the place where the dangerous man was wasn't searched extensively and -- and the mother -- nobody was put in handcuffs, and yet for this -- they knew pretty soon that Romero wasn't on the premises.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4045 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they knew right away.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4046 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. And that's, I guess, your -- your point, that the place where the dangerous man was is not --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4047 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that that explains one of the reasons why the jury imposed punitive damages here because they -- they knew that at 8:45, at the time that Officer Muehler said that the search was over and all the officers were out of the house and -- and everything was done, that Mr. Romero was cited and released for marijuana possession. And at the same time, from 8:45 until sometime after 9 o'clock, probably as long as 30, maybe longer, Iris Mena was sitting in a cold, damp, converted garage with her hands behind her back.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4048 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You might be able to keep your verdict, I -- I think. But I think the problem here is the Ninth Circuit -- you go to the Ninth Circuit and you say, you know, there was excessive force here on anybody's definition for reasons that you say. And -- and the Ninth Circuit says, oh, it was a clear violation of the Constitution and we'll tell you why, and then they give some reasons. And two of those reasons are, A, four and a half pages written the reason that this was unconstitutional is because they asked her questions about her immigration status, which you -- I don't think you even raised. Maybe you did. But anyway, that's -- that's the bulk of the -- of -- of -- that's the bulk of the analysis. And -- and these are the words that I think they're objecting to. And by any standard of reasonableness, Mena was -- the -- the officers should have released her from the handcuffs when it became clear that she posed no immediate threat. And that was long before the -- the -- because she wasn't a threat. And that was long before the end of the search. And what their point is on that is, you know, if that's the rule, that's going to interfere with our SWAT teams because they can't operate that way. They -- they can't evaluate the individual. They put the individual -- if there are guns and gangs and danger that she'll grab a gun, they put her in handcuffs, and they hold her there for the search for a couple of hours, then they release her. Now, that's their argument. So they're objecting not so much to -- to the fact they have to pay $30,000 -- or they may object to that. But they're -- they're objecting to the holding of the Ninth Circuit, and if they're right on that, then I guess we have to send it back and say, do this over again, though I'll be sorry about that and maybe there is a way not to do it. But -- but I want to know your view of what I see as those two issues here, that the Ninth Circuit's analysis was wrong.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4049 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I mean, first of all, I'd -- I'd say that the -- the Court could affirm the judgment in this case and the verdict in this case on the ground that we --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4050 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but then we can't really reach the issue. That's a possibility. I see that.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4051 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And in fact -- and I -- I think that would be the appropriate thing to do.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4052 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but then suppose that the reason that this case is here is because of the implications --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4053 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4054 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- of the Ninth Circuit's analysis --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4055 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4056 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- not necessarily the extra 30 minutes because I see your point on the extra 30 minutes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4057 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think -- I think that there -- I would divide my response to that, Justice Breyer, into two parts really. On the questioning issue, I would just say that that -- that was not an issue that was presented to the jury for its verdict as a separate Fourth Amendment violation. It wasn't. And we didn't argue it in the Ninth Circuit. What we did -- we did say in our -- in our brief to the Ninth Circuit that she was questioned about her immigration status about an issue that was unrelated to -- to Summers detention. We did say that.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4058 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we could say is their opinion -- that's their opinion. It's beside the point, et cetera.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4059 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. So, I mean, I -- I think on questioning, you know, we -- we haven't been pushing that issue.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4060 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if two of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit gave are in our view incorrect, why wouldn't we reverse and remand for them to do it without -- to make the judgment without taking those two factors into account?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4061 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think what -- first of all, it's a separate alternative holding. What they said is that there was a separate Fourth Amendment violation while they affirmed on the basis that we actually won on. The jury found that she had been detained longer than was reasonable and with more force than was reasonable. This is a jury verdict. The Ninth Circuit affirmed that. And we've argued in our brief that if the Court did something on questioning, it would really be issuing an advisory opinion in this -- in this situation. And, you know, we've -- we've argued the point and we're prepared certainly to argue about the merits of that question because it's obviously an important question. In our view, the questioning issue should be governed by the more traditional Terry kind of idea that you can't question when it goes beyond the scope of the limited purposes of the intrusion, but we also understand that that's contested.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4062 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4063 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4064 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- well, it does seem to me that --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4065 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Excuse me.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4066 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it does seem -- seem to me that the Ninth Circuit's opinion is questionable on -- on this key point of when she had to be released. The officers should have released her when it became clear she posed no immediate threat and did not resist arrest.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4067 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4068 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that is critical to its holding.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4069 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4070 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that implies that they have a -- a duty at the outset to determine whether -- what her status is rather than to go around looking for guns and -- and to secure the premises. That's -- that's one of my concerns with that.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4071 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I would have a different position on that. First of all, I think that the judgment can actually be affirmed on the first ground regardless of this issue because it was a -- a jury verdict and -- and the damages were asked for either/or in terms of question 5 or 6.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4083 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. They searched that room. So the room was searched before they went there. They searched all the rooms. They searched Ms. Mena's room and found absolutely nothing there. And -- and the testimony -- and this goes to Justice Souter's question.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4084 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did they -- did they search the individuals too to make sure --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4085 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4086 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I assume they did.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4087 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, yes. They -- they searched the individuals. They -- they -- you know, they completely made sure that -- that when they put them in that back room, there was nothing in the room. There was nothing on the individuals. There was nothing that -- that could cause them danger. And -- and the jury, I think, was entitled to -- to look at those facts and -- and to hear the facts and to see the facts --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4088 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How did the qualified immunity question get resolved here?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4089 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4090 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what -- what role did that play in all of this?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4091 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, at the -- at the district court level, the -- the district court heard a rule 59. But one of the things about this case is it was tried right around the time that Saucier v. Katz came out, and in the Ninth Circuit, there was a question about who got to decide qualified immunity. This was June 2001 actually. And so there was a rule 59 motion about whether the proper standard of qualified immunity had been applied. The district judge, looking at the facts, found that there were facts to sustain the verdict, including evidence that Ms. Mena had been kept after the end of the search. The district judge found that. And then in -- in the Ninth Circuit, of course, the Ninth Circuit's published opinion deals with qualified immunity on both of these issues. And basically the -- the qualified immunity -- on the -- on the over-detention claim, I think they've conceded that there just isn't any justification for -- I mean, a de minimis exception doesn't extend to 30 minutes. I mean, that -- this Court has debated whether 15 or 20 is too long on a -- on a Terry stop when there's actually reasonable suspicion. Here, there's nothing to hold her. With respect to the handcuffing issue --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4092 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it clear that it was 30?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4093 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think in viewing the light most favorable to the verdict, I think the Court has to assume that -- that the jury could have found an hour. But what I'm saying is based on the officer's own testimony alone, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, it's at least 27 to 32. And so you've got something that just could not possibly be considered de minimis under any kind of exception. And -- and that's why they fought it on the facts. They haven't even made an argument on the law at any point in this. And with respect to handcuffing, I think our position on the handcuffing is that Summers, first of all, doesn't deal with handcuffing. And the other side has consistently tried to equate detention with restraint. And I think what -- what Summers indicated was that this Court was willing to allow people to be detained during the course of a search for three specific reasons. And when balancing the nature of the intrusion against the justifications, this Court specifically said it was endorsing a limited intrusion, and that it wouldn't be very much different asking someone to sit around --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4094 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Doesn't that just go to the point that it's not clearly established at least?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4095 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, no. I -- I don't think that is the case, Justice Kennedy, because in -- in -- Summers doesn't authorize what they did. Graham certainly talks about having to justify force based on a -- on a Fourth Amendment analysis. And Franklin v. Foxworth, which is a Ninth Circuit case that happened before this case, the Court, first of all, used the -- the analysis that we have argued is appropriate based on Summers and Graham to decide that a particular Summers detention was carried out in an unreasonable manner.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4096 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but that was ill individual, a single individual --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4097 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4098 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- unclothed, et cetera --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4099 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I -- I understand that the facts were more egregious, but the -- the Court's analysis for a reasonable officer from a qualified immunity standpoint -- for a reasonable officer reading that opinion, you draw at least three conclusions I think. One is that the proper analysis to determine whether handcuffing or some additional form of restraint is -- is allowed has to be decided under the kinds of justifications that Summers provides and under a Graham analysis when it comes to force. And there's lots of cases that -- that allow officers to do that. Lots of lower court cases. In fact, our view is all the lower court cases follow that kind of analysis and just come out differently depending on the facts and circumstances confronted. The second thing, the -- the point about the disabled person and the particular facts made that case particularly egregious, and the Ninth Circuit said those were additional factors, not the line. The Ninth Circuit didn't say that the constitutional standard was particularly abusive or egregious. It -- it applied traditional Fourth Amendment analysis. And finally and I think very important and not dealt with maybe in the briefs as much as it should be is that the Ninth Circuit in -- in Franklin rejected a blanket handcuffing policy. That's what the policy was in Portland. The Portland police department had a policy that said you are to handcuff everybody until the search is over. And the Ninth Circuit said you can't have that kind of policy because Summers and -- and Graham require it to be individualized justification for that -- for an additional intrusion beyond the limited intrusion that's allowed in Summers. And in fact, in Summers, the Court went out of its way to say to compare with what the Court was allowing to what it -- to -- to the circumstances in Dunaway, to -- to circumstances that start to look like an arrest. And I don't know how much more intrusive you could be than what these officers did to Iris Mena, and I think that's one of the -- the issues here. If -- if the --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what do we do if we think the Ninth Circuit was off base in -- in whether Mena could be questioned about her immigration status?
03-1423 +++$+++ 4101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I think that --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That seemed to be an important part of the Ninth Circuit's rule.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's certainly -- it's certainly an alternative ground. It's not -- it doesn't affect, I think, our verdict. And so I think what -- I mean, I suppose the Court could dismiss that question as improvidently granted, could say to the court that it -- that it should reverse that part of the ruling.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4104 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It might be useful to say they were wrong in --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4105 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that -- you -- you could say that. I mean, I would -- on the merits of the question, I -- I would like to -- if we were reaching that, I would argue that the Ninth Circuit -- that -- that there is -- there should be a limit on questioning in a -- in a Summers detention, and the Court should apply the kind of Terry analysis that the majority of the -- the circuits apply.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4106 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What -- what will do if we thought the Ninth Circuit was egregiously wrong on that and that its opinion was, to use the most polite word, disingenuous when it talked about a garage? That -- that was somewhat off-putting to me when it was a converted garage with a bed.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4107 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HOFFMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I mean --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the jury --
03-1423 +++$+++ 4118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- their theory of the case, and that's what the Ninth Circuit said, is yes, we do have that affirmative obligation.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the jury answered the -- just the general question, was the duration unreasonable, and the jury said yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not of the search. Of her detention.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, of her detention. And that was based on the jury's determination that we had detained her beyond the period we had done the sweep.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So if the district court got it right and the Ninth Circuit wrote a poor opinion, why should we upset the judgment in the case? In other words, if what we had here was a trial that was okay, a district judge that behaved -- gave a proper charge, then the Ninth Circuit writes an opinion that doesn't seem to deal with what the district court and the jury decided.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the -- the court of appeals' obligation here was to evaluate our argument that we should -- we were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The court of appeals put forth what it regarded as the most legitimate bases on which to affirm the judgment in this case. The fact that neither of those withstand serious scrutiny, Justice Ginsburg, seems to me to be a basis for reversing the Ninth Circuit and allowing the matter to go back at this point. And -- and that is exactly what this Court does in -- you know, said it will do in Ornelas, that it is a de novo review. Punitive damages, exactly like a punitive damages cases. Juries make punitive damages determinations every day and every day courts of appeals and trial judges review those damages awards de novo because they -- because the question is not just what are the historical facts -- that you give deference to the jury on -- but on the fundamental question of what is the rule of law that will govern the police officers in the execution of search warrants in circumstances like this. They need protection, Your Honor. Thank you.
03-1423 +++$+++ 4125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Phillips. The case is submitted.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4129 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We will now hear argument in Gonzales, et al. against Raich. General Clement.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4131 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Through the Controlled Substances Act, Congress has comprehensively regulated the national market in drugs with the potential for abuse. And with respect to Schedule I substances, like marijuana, that have both a high potential for abuse and no currently accepted medical use in treatment, Congress categorically prohibits interstate trafficking outside the narrow and carefully controlled confines of federally approved research programs.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Mr. Clement, the -- I think it is reasonably clear that Congress spoke very broadly in the Act, and the question, for me, turns on whether Lopez and Morrison dictate some concerns with its application in this context.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, I don't think either Lopez or Morrison casts any doubt on the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act, and I think, in particular, that's because the decisions in Lopez and Morrison cited, with approval, cases like Darby and Wickard, and preserved those cases. And, of course, the concurring opinion of Justice Kennedy did so, as well.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but in Wickard, of course, you had a wheat grower, a small farmer, and his wheat did, in part, go in the national market. You don't have that here. As I understand it, if California's law applies, then none of this home-grown for medical-use marijuana will be on any interstate market. And it is in the area of something traditionally regulated by states. So how do you distinguish Morrison? And how do you distinguish Lopez?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice O'Connor, let me first say that I think it might be a bit optimistic to think that none of the marijuana that's produced consistent with California law would be diverted into the national market for marijuana. And, of course, the Controlled Substances Act is concerned, at almost every step of the Act, with a concern about diversion, both of lawful substances from medical to non-medical uses and from controlled substances under Schedule I into the national market.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in looking at this broad challenge, do we have to assume that the State of California will enforce its law? I mean, if it turns out that it isn't and that marijuana is getting in the interstate market, that might be a different thing.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4137 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, with respect, Justice O'Connor, on this record, I don't think that there's any reason to assume that California is going to have some sort of almost unnatural ability to keep one part of a fungible national drug market separate. And I think Congress, here, made important findings that you've alluded to, not just that there's a national market, not just that the intrastate and the interstate markets are linked, but that drugs are fungible, and that because drugs are fungible, it's simply not feasible, in Congress' words, to regulate and separately focus on only drugs that have traveled on interstate commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4138 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, General Clement, what if we were to assume -- I'm not saying this is -- that the District Court could find that there is a narrow segment of the market in which they could prevent diversions, and they had -- say they made such findings. Would we have to disregard them, or say they were irrelevant?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think you would say they were irrelevant, Justice Stevens, and that's because --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But then why do you need to rely on the possibility of diversion?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, because I think it is a reality, in responding to Justice O'Connor's question -- I think that in -- obviously, in all of these commerce --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yeah, but in my hypothesis, it's a nonexistent reality.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in your hypothetical -- and if I could turn to that -- I still think the analysis would not turn on whether or not the truth of the supposition that diversion could be prevented, because this Court, in a series of cases, including Darby, Wickard, Wirtz, and Perez, has made clear that the relevant focal point for analysis is not the individual plaintiff's activities and whether they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, but whether the class of activities that Congress has decided to regulate has such a substantial effect. And, in this case, there's no question that the overall production, distribution, and possession of marijuana and other Schedule I substances has a profound effect on interstate commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4144 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's not an interstate commerce that you want to foster. I mean, in these other -- in these other cases, Congress presumably wanted to foster interstate commerce in wheat, in Wickard v. Filburn. Congress doesn't want interstate commerce in marijuana. And it seems rather ironic to appeal to the fact that home-grown marijuana would reduce the interstate commerce that you don't want to occur in order to regulate it. I mean, you know, doesn't that strike you as strange?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4145 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, no, it doesn't, Justice Scalia, but let me respond in two ways. First of all, I think it's been clear, at least since the lottery case, that Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce includes the authority to prohibit items traveling in interstate commerce and to declare something contraband in interstate commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I would suggest that it is a perfectly rational exercise of Congress' judgement to treat marijuana and other Schedule I substances not just as contraband in interstate commerce, but as contraband simpliciter, as contraband for all purposes.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's quite a different rational than from Wickard v. Filburn. I mean, it seems to me you're not -- you're not appealing to the fact that it has a substantial impact on interstate commerce. You're appealing to the fact that the power which Congress has to prohibit the use of goods carried in interstate commerce cannot effectively be implemented without this law.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think there's some truth to that, Justice Scalia, but let me say this. I think what I'm saying is, I'm taking the rational that this Court accepted in Wickard, and I'm applying it to a different regulatory regime. Here, Congress --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you're applying it to the opposite kind of regulatory -- you're applying it to a regulatory regime in which the government wants to prohibit this subject -- substance from being sold or -- in interstate commerce. And if you just follow the litter -- letter of this law, this marijuana won't get into interstate commerce. In fact, it would reduce the demand for marijuana, because it would supply these local users and they wouldn't have to go into the interstate market.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, with respect, Justice Stevens, if you took a look at the Controlled Substances Act, itself, and read it literally, you'd assume that there was absolutely no market, period, in Schedule I substances. But the reality is, there's a $10.5 billion market -- illegal market, albeit -- but market in marijuana in the United States, on an annual basis. So --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But to the extent that this statute has any impact, it will reduce the purchase in the interstate market and confine these to locally grown marijuana.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, first of all, Justice Stevens, that's only true if there will be no diversion, to get back to --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then I'm assuming -- my hypothetical is that California could pass a law that would prevent diversions from occurring.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in the same way that the Federal Government has had trouble stamping out the marijuana market entirely, I think California is going to have parallel problems in absolutely preventing diversion.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But just --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I suppose some -- one answer to that case is the Perez case, with loan sharking.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, absolutely, Justice Kennedy. And, in that context, what this Court said is, even though it was focused on what was going to be an -- both in that case and generally, an interstate activity, Congress did not have to just look at the particular plaintiff's effect on interstate commerce, but, rather, the effect of the entire class of activities. And if I could --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, as Justice O'Connor brought out earlier, all those cases -- Wickard, Perez -- they all involve a commercial enterprise. And, here, we're told this is different, because nobody is buying anything, nobody is selling anything.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, with respect, Justice Ginsburg, I think the whole point of the Wickard case was to extend rationales that it applied previously to commerce to activity that the Court described as economic, but not commercial. And I think the production and distribution and possession of marijuana is economic in the same way that the production of wheat was in the Wickard case.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you're -- no, I was going to -- your whole point, I take it, is that the two particular patients in this case are simply -- simply cannot be taken, for our purposes, as representative in the fact that they are getting the marijuana by, I think, growing it themselves or being given it. You're saying, you cannot take that fact as a fact from which to generalize in deciding this case.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly right, Justice Souter, and that is the logic, not just of me, but of this Court's cases, in cases like Darby and Wickard and Wirtz and Perez. And I point to the Wickard case, in particular, only because it, too, involves a non-commercial enterprise or a non-commercial production of --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I do take issue with that. As I read the record in Wickard, it involved a small farmer. A portion of his wheat went on the interstate market. It also was fed to cattle, which, in turn, went on the interstate market. He used some of it himself, but part of it was commercial. I think Wickard can be distinguished on the facts.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice O'Connor, it could be -- I mean, any case can be distinguished on the facts, of course, but I think what's important is, this Court, in Wickard, itself, recognized that the case was -- it was only interesting because a portion of the regulated wheat involved wheat that was going to be consumed on the farm. And --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The other portion is a matter of [inaudible] interstate commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's true, Justice O'Connor, but this Court, basically, in its opinion, Justice Jackson, for the Court, put aside -- to one side all of the grain that was going to go in interstate commerce, since that's easy under our existing precedents. This case is only interesting, he said, because it involves wheat that's going to be consumed on the farm. And he specifically talked about both the wheat that would be fed to the animals, but also the wheat that would be consumed by the family. And what he said is, the intended disposition of the particular wheat wasn't clear from the record of the case. And, by that, I take him to mean that it wasn't relevant to the Court's analysis in upholding the Agricultural Adjustment Act to the wheat at issue there. And it's important to recognize that the way the Agricultural Adjustment Act worked is, it applied to all the wheat that was grown in excess of the quota, and so it applied to the wheat that was used by the family for consumption of their own bread. And, nonetheless, this Court upheld that as a valid Commerce Clause regulation. And so I think, by parity of reasoning, all of the marijuana that's at issue and covered by the Controlled Substances Act, whether it's lawful under state law, whether it's involved in a market transaction or not, is fairly within the Congress' Commerce Clause --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And is --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- authority.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- this a harder or easier case than Wickard when we know that, in Wickard, it was lawful to buy and sell wheat, and, here, it is unlawful to buy and sell marijuana?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Kennedy --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does this make your case easier, in a sense, or --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it does, Justice Kennedy, because, as I said earlier, in responding to a question from Justice Scalia, I think if you're talking about a context where Congress has the undoubted power to prohibit something in interstate commerce entirely, and has exercised that power, so it treats something as effectively contraband in interstate commerce, and then takes the complementary step, especially in light of the fungibility of the product, and says, "We're just going to treat this as contraband simpliciter." I think that judgement by Congress has a very definite link to interstate commerce and its unquestioned authority to regulate interstate commerce. And I do think there's a sense in which when Congress is regulating the price of something, there's certainly a temptation to excise out relatively small producers and for Congress to say, "Well, we can still have effective regulation if we regulate the vast majority of production." But with respect to something that's unlawful to have and is -- and has very significant risks precisely because it's unlawful, any little island of lawful possession of non-contraband marijuana, for example, poses a real challenge to the statutory regime. It would also, I think, frustrate Congress' goal in promoting health. And I think the clearest example of that is the fact that, to the extent there is anything beneficial, health-wise, in marijuana, it's THC, which has been isolated and provided in a pill form, and has been available as a Schedule III substance, called --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there's --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- Marinol.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- but there is, in this record, a showing that, for at least one of the two plaintiffs, there were some 30-odd drugs taken, none of them worked. This was the only one that would. And it -- Justice Souter asked you about these two plaintiffs. The law can't be made on the basis of those two plaintiffs. But let's suppose that you're right, generally. If there were to be a prosecution of any of the plaintiffs in this case, would there be any defense, if there were to be a federal prosecution?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think we would take the position, based on our reading of the Oakland Cannabis case -- and, obviously, different justices on this Court read the opinion differently and had different views on the extent to which the medical-necessity defense was foreclosed by that opinion -- I would imagine the Federal Government, in that case, if it took the unlikely step of bringing the prosecution in the first place, would be arguing that, on the authority of Oakland Cannabis, the medical-necessity defense was not available. But I think, in any event, what is important, at this point, is that we don't have a prosecution; we have an affirmative effort to strike down the Controlled Substances Act in an injunctive action. And I think, in that context, certainly Justice Souter is right, that this Court's precedents make clear that one doesn't consider only the individual's conduct, but the entire class of activities that's at issue. I think, in this regard, it's also worth emphasizing that a deeper flaw in the Respondent's argument, that California law is somehow relevant here or the fact that their conduct is lawful under California law, is that there's a mismatch between what California law makes lawful and what might be considered relevant for arguing that there's an attenuated effect on interstate commerce. Because the California law makes the possession of marijuana for medical use lawful under state law, without regard to whether that marijuana has been involved in a cash transaction or has crossed state lines. And so, if Respondents are right on their Commerce Clause theory, I don't see how they can be right because their conduct is lawful under state law or because their -- that marijuana use is medical. If they're right, then I think their analysis would extend to recreational use of marijuana, as well as medical use of marijuana, and would extend to every state in the nation, not just --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- those states that made it lawful.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Doesn't it depend on how you define the "relevant class of activities"? Is it the entire class that Congress ought to regulate, or is it a narrower class, in which the Plaintiffs contend that the statute cannot constitutionally be applied to a particular very narrowly defined class? And is it ever permissible to define the class narrowly to escape a -- the broad argument that you make?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't think that is permissible, Justice Stevens. I think that's what this Court's cases in Wirtz, in Darby, in Wickard --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you're saying that this statute could never have an unconstitutional application.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under the Commerce Clause, I -- that's exactly right, that would be our position. It is constitutional on its face, and it -- and because of that line of authority, an as-applied challenge can be brought, but the legal test that's applied in the as-applied challenge is one that considers the constitutionality of the statute as a whole --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, in Morrison, did the Court's opinion not say that Congress cannot justify Commerce Cause -- Clause legislation by using a long but- for causal chain from the activity in question to an impact on interstate commerce? I mean, the Court certainly made that statement.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, absolutely, Justice O'Connor, but --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which cuts against what you're saying.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, with respect, I don't think so. And I'd say two things about it. One, this Court, in Morrison and Lopez, was very important to emphasize -- thought it very important to emphasize two things: one, that the activity there was non-economic in a way that differentiated it, even from Wickard; and, second, the Court also made it clear that the regulation that there -- there was not essential to the effectiveness of an overall regulatory scheme. And I think, on both points, this case is on the constitutional side of the line that separates the Lopez and the Morrison case.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The argument on the other side is that this limited exception is a non-economic use -- growing for personal use, under prescription --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand that -- I understand that's their argument, Justice O'Connor, but I don't understand how this Court, in Lopez, could have said that Wickard involved non-economic activity if this activity is not also covered. You're talking about --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Involved economic activity.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry if I misspoke. Economic activity. Because what you're talking about here is the possession, the manufacture, the distribution of a valuable commodity for which there is a ready -- unfortunately, a ready market, albeit an illicit market.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If we rule for the Respondents in this case, do you think the street price of marijuana would go up or down in California?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would be speculating, Justice Kennedy, but I think the price would go down. And I think that what -- and that, in a sense, is consistent with the government's position, which is to say, when the government thinks that something is dangerous, it tries to prohibit it. Part of the effort of prohibiting it is going to lead to a black market, where the prohibition actually would force the price up. And there is a sense in which this regulation, although not primarily designed as a price regulation -- the Controlled Substance Act, I think, does have the effect of increasing the price for marijuana in a way that stamps down demand and limits the -- and in a way that reduces demand. And I think that's all consistent with Congress' judgement here. And if I could return for a second to the point about Marinol, what's important there is that the process of manufacturing of Marinol, and isolating the one helpful component, does two things. One, the manufacturing process allows there to be a safe use for one of the components in marijuana. But it also provides an unambiguous hook for Congress to exercise its Commerce Clause authority. And yet the overall regime of trying to get people to use more healthful substances, and not use things like crude marijuana that have harmful effects, is undermined if Congress can't also address that which is more harmful, but is distinct only because it is capable of being locally produced. And that's exactly what crude marijuana is.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In other words, the statute is -- it trumps the independent judgement of the physicians who prescribe it for the patients at issue in this case.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think, in responding to that, Justice Stevens, I would say, obviously, for purposes of federal law, the idea of medical marijuana is something of an oxymoron, because the Federal Government treats it as a Schedule I substance. Now, notwithstanding that, some doctors may make a different judgement about a particular patient; but that's something that this Court, I think, has previously understood, that the federal regulatory regime does not allow individual patients or doctors to exempt themselves out of that regime.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that's the import of the Rutherford decision with Laetrile.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think there could be any state of facts on which a judicial tribunal could disagree with the finding of Congress that there's no acceptable medical use? Say they had a -- say there was a judicial hearing on which they made a contrary finding. Would we have to ignore that? Would we have to follow the congressional finding or the judicial finding if that happened?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it depends on the exact hypothetical you have in mind. I think the -- the judicial finding that I think would be appropriate, and this Court would not have to ignore in any way, is a finding by the D.C. Circuit that, in a particular case where there's a rescheduling effort before the FDA, that the underlying judgement of the FDA refusing to reschedule is invalid, arbitrary, capricious. That's the way to go after the finding that marijuana is a Schedule I substance without a valid medical use in treatment. This is not a situation in -- and your hypothetical might respond to a different statute that raised a harder question, where Congress made such a medical finding, and then just left it there without any mechanism to adjust the finding for changing realities. But, here, Congress made it clear that a process remains open to reschedule marijuana in a way that gets it onto Schedule II or Schedule III. And I think it's wrong to assume that there's any inherent hostility to the substances at issue here. I mean, the FDA, for example, rescheduled Marinol from Schedule II to Schedule III in a way that had the effect of making it easier to prescribe and more available. But I think what's going on with the FDA is an effort to try to counterbalance the risk for abuse, the risk for diversion, with these other considerations of getting safe medicine --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Have there --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- available to patients --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- have there been any applications to change the schedule for marijuana to the FDA?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There have been a number of those petitions that have been filed. There was one recently rejected, I think as recently as 2001; it may be 1999. There was also a series of, kind of, a four- or five-iteration effort to change the rescheduling that culminated in a D.C. Circuit opinion in the early '90s. So there's definitely been these efforts. But on the current state of the -- of the record, there just is not a justification for changing the schedule. And I think both of the briefs talked a little bit about the Institute of Medicine's study about the medical efficacy of marijuana. And I think one thing that's important to keep in mind that that study comes to a conclusion about is, whatever benefits there may be for the individual components in marijuana, that smoked -- smoked marijuana itself really doesn't have any future as medicine, because -- and that's true, I think, for two reasons. One, there's something like 400 different chemical components in crude marijuana that one would smoke, and it's -- it just, sort of, belies any logic that all 400 of those would be helpful. And a big part of the process of medicine, generally, is to take raw, crude material that somebody could grow in their garden, and actually have people who do this for a living get involved in a process of synthesizing and isolating the beneficial components, and then manufacturing and making that available. The second reason that smoked marijuana doesn't have much of a future as medicine is, as I think people understand, smoking is harmful; and that's true of tobacco, but it's also true of marijuana. And so the idea that smoked marijuana would be an effective delivery device for medicine, I think, is also something that really doesn't have any future as medicine. What does have a future for medicine, of course, is an effort to synthesize and isolate the beneficial component. That's been done with Marinol. It is true that some people have difficulty tolerating the pill form that Marinol is available in. And there's ongoing research to try to figure out different ways to deliver that substance. But there is, in a sense, a little bit of a -- and the Institute of Medicine's study has about five pages discussing Marinol, and it makes the point that there's something of a tradeoff. Because one of the downsides of Marinol, as opposed to marijuana, is that it takes longer to get into the bloodstream. But that's also one of the reasons why the FDA has made a judgement that Marinol is less subject to abuse, because it takes longer to get into the drug-stream, and so it doesn't have the characteristic of street drugs that tend to be abused, which is a very quick delivery time between the taking of the substance and the time that it has an effect on the system.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I go back to your point a few minutes ago about -- it was, sort of, a categoric point -- you, in effect, said, "If this argument succeeds with respect to medical use of marijuana, the next argument is going to be recreational use, and there's no real way to distinguish between them." Wouldn't this be a way to distinguish between them? That in deciding what class you are going to -- or what subclass you're going to consider from which to generalize, you simply ask the question, "What good reasons are there to define a subclass this way?" In this particular case, the good reasons to define a subclass of medical usage are the benefits -- whether you accept the evidence is another thing -- but the benefits which the doctors say that, under present circumstances, you can get from smoking it, as opposed to taking the synthesized drug. There's no such argument, I would guess, in favor of recreational marijuana usage as a separate category. And, for that reason, isn't there a -- isn't there a good reason to categorize this as narrowly as the Respondents are doing here, just medical usage, without any risk of generalizing to recreational usage?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think that it would be a good idea for this Court to get on a path of starting to second-guess Congress' judgement about defining a class of activities --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That may -- oh, that may be, but it seems to me that that's a separate argument, because you're -- you were arguing before that if you recognize medical usage, you don't have any way of drawing the line against private recreational usage. And I'm suggesting that you do have a reason for drawing that line, and it's the benefit for medical usage, if you accept the evidence; whereas, there is no reason to categorize recreational usage separately, and that seems to me a category argument, rather than a respect-for-Congress argument.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Souter, I have no doubt that this Court could draw a line. I think it would find it very difficult to police that line over the broad variety of cases. I think it would find it every bit as frustrating as policing the line in Hammer against Dagenhart that this Court abandoned in Darby. With that, I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Barnett.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4209 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: I have two points to make. First, the class of activities involved in this case are non-economic and wholly intrastate. Second, the federal prohibition of this class of activities it not essential -- is not an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated. If you accept the government's contrary contentions on either of these two points, Ashcroft v. Raich will replace Wickard v. Filburn as the most far-reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, on your first point, can't we infer from the fact that there's an enormous market, commercial market, for any given commodity, that simple possession of that commodity is a form of participation in the market?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It can be, or it might not be. If you possess an item that came from the market or is going to the market, simple possession could easily be a part of the marketplace. But if you're in possession of an item that you've made, yourself, that is disconnected from the market -- it didn't come from the market and it's not going to the market --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but it's fungible.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- the fungibility issue is in this case, but the -- but a -- the fact that a good is fungible does not make it a market good, and it does not make the possession of that good an economic activity. Or --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you know, Congress has applied this theory in other contexts. One is the protection of endangered species. Congress has made it unlawful to possess ivory, for example. It doesn't matter whether you got it lawfully, or not; or eagle feathers, the mere possession of it, whether you got it through interstate commerce or not. And Congress' reasoning is, "We can't tell whether it came through interstate commerce or not, and to try to prove that is just beyond our ability; and, therefore, it is unlawful to possess it, period." Now, are those -- are those laws, likewise, unconstitutional, as going beyond Congress' commerce power?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not if they're an essential part of a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut, unless those activities are reached.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, why is that different from this?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because this class of activities -- because it's been isolated by the State of California, and is policed by the State of California, so that it's entirely separated from the market --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isolated and -- I understand that there are some communes that grow marijuana for the medical use of all of the members of the communes.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That class of activities is not before the Court. That is actually before --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but it's before the Court when you -- when you raise the policing of the problem by California, and saying it's not a -- it's not a real problem, you brought it before the Court.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that class of activities could be -- could be -- if this Court limits its ruling to the class of activities that is before the Court, that class --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which is -- which is what?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which is --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ An individual grower?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ An individual who is growing it for her -- him- or herself, who has -- or has a caregiver growing it for her --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Gee, what basis --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- for --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- what basis is there to draw it that narrowly? I mean, I guess if we -- we could say people whose last name begins with a Z. You know, that would narrow the category, too. But why does -- why does that make any sense?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, we believe it makes sense because we are talking about a classification of activities that has been identified by the State of California, and which is rational to distinguish from --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, but California hasn't identified individual growers. Communes are okay, as far as California law is concerned.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's not entirely clear whether communes are okay, as far as the California laws are concerned.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why wouldn't it be?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because if, in fact, commercial activity is taking place, if buying and selling is taking place --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, they're not buying and selling. I mean, you can't prove they're buying and selling. There are just a whole lot of people there, with alleged medical needs.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, I don't understand. Is there any authority in the commerce cases for -- an X, which is there in the middle of a state, and it doesn't move one way or the other -- now, Congress' power does extend to the X if the state doesn't say something about the X. But if the state says something about the X, then Congress' power does not extend to it. That's hard for me to accept, because I don't see -- whether it's commerce or not commerce, whether it affects something or doesn't affect something, doesn't seem to me to have much to do with whether the state separately regulates it, and I can't find any support at all for that in any case.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The support would come from the exception to Lopez and Morrison that the government is urging that the Court adopt, that the Congress can reach non-economic activity that's intrastate, that's wholly intrastate, if doing so is essential to a larger regulatory scheme that would be undercut if they can't reach it.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, here, they say -- look, I take it you're using this because I was going to ask you. You know, he grows heroin, cocaine, tomatoes that are going to have genomes in them that could, at some point, lead to tomato children that will eventually affect Boston. You know, we can -- oil that's never, in fact, being used, but we want an inventory of it, federally. You know, I can multiply the examples --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and you can, too. So you're going to get around all those examples by saying what?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ By saying that it's all going to depend on the regulatory scheme, what the --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- purpose of the --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So now what you're saying is, in a Commerce Clause case, what we're supposed to do is to start to look at the federal scheme and the state scheme and see, comparing the federal scheme and the state scheme, whether, given the state scheme, the federal scheme is really necessary to include this. That's a task, and I'm trying to make it as complicated as I can in my question. [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I see it very well. Here is what they say. They say that, "By the way, a hundred-thousand people using medical marijuana in California will lead to lower marijuana prices in the nation. Bad. And, second, when we see medical marijuana in California, we won't know what it is. Everybody'll say, 'Mine is medical.' Certificates will circulate on the black market. We face a mess. For both those reasons, it does have an impact," they say. Now, what's your response?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you've raised at least two different practical issues. One is the fact -- the number of people who are in the class, and the second is the ability to identify whether they properly belong in the class. As for the number of people, we are talking about a very small number of people. They say a hundred-thousand. They get their figures from the National Organization from Reform of Marijuana Laws. Our figures in our brief come from the government. The figures show it's a very small fraction of persons that would be involved. And their argument is basically -- and the logic of your hypothetical is premised on -- the more people that go into the illicit market, the better for federal drug policy, because that will drive the price up. You have to -- what we're take -- we're doing is, we're taking people out of the illicit drug market, which then, under your hypothetical, would lead to a reduction -- and Justice Kennedy's suggestion -- would lead to a reduction in the price of the illegal market, which, the opposite would be, they're -- it's good for federal policy to have more people in the illicit drug market, because that's going to drive the price up.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, we don't want more people --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course not.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- in the illicit drug market. [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course not.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And we don't want low prices, either. [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the -- but the -- but the scheme of -- but the class of activities that have been authorized by the State of California will take people out of --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So, normally I would have said, it's up to Congress to figure out how to -- the way that -- you have one going one way, one going the other way, and balancing those factors would be for Congress. That's what we'd normally say.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you say all that stuff is not for Congress; that's for us.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, within this exception -- the threshold issue -- I do want to make sure that I focus on this -- the threshold issue, which is the issue that has occupied most of our time so far, is whether the activity here is economic or non-economic. The government claims it's economic, we claim it's non-economic.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what it is, is, it's non-economic, and it affects the economic.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. So the threshold issue that is -- that -- upon which Lopez and Morrison terms -- turns is whether it's economic or non-economic.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I should have thought that regular household chores of -- say, performed in an earlier time mostly by women, was classically economic -- washing dishes, making bread. And now you say growing marijuana isn't?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you accept the government's definition of economic, then every -- then washing dishes, today, would be economic, and that --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but even --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- would be within the -- within the power of Congress to reach.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But even if we accept your definition of economic, I don't see that it is a basis upon which we ought to make a category decision. You say it's non-economic because one of these people is a -- is a self-grower, another one is getting it from a friend for nothing. But I don't see what reason that you have given, or any reason that you haven't given, for us to believe that, out of -- now I'm going to assume, for the sake of argument, a hundred-thousand potential users -- everybody is going to get it from a friend or from plants in the backyard. Seems to me the sensible assumption is, they're going to get it on the street. And once they get it, under California law, it's not a crime for them to have it and use it. But they're going to get it in the street. Why isn't that the sensible assumption?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they have an -- they have a very strong incentive not to get it on the street, because getting it on the street is going to subject them to criminal prosecution, under both California and federal law, as well as the --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah, but the -- it's also the case that approximately 10 percent of the American population is doing that every day, if I accept the figures in the government's brief, and they're not getting prosecuted.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But we're talking -- in that case, we're talking about people who are using it for sport, for recreation. We are talking about a class of people here who are sick people, who don't necessarily want to violate the law.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if I am a sick person, I'm going to say, "Look, if they're not prosecuting every kid who buys, what, a nickel bag or whatever you call a small quantity today, they're not going to prosecute me, either." I mean, there's not going to be any incentive, it seems to me, to avoid the street market.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The government, in their brief, asserts that the -- that the possession statute that currently exists provides a deterrent effect, which is why they -- which is their explanation for why they failed to enforce the possession statute that they say is so essential to the --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If one --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- regulatory scheme.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- if one takes your view, that this is non-economic activity, so it's outside Congress' commerce power, then explain to me why, if you have someone similarly situated in a neighboring state, somebody whose doctor says, "This person needs marijuana to live," but that state doesn't have a Compassionate-Use Act -- it's just as isolated -- no purchase, no sale, grown at home, good friend grows it -- and yet you say Congress could regulate that, if I understand your brief properly.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your -- yes, Your Honor, because there's the -- that's the second step of the analysis. The first step of the analysis is the economic/non-economic. If you don't -- if the Court stops there, then they could also apply in these other states. But then if the Court adopts --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if you -- if you buy that -- so your first answer is, yes, on your first argument, it would be equally impermissible for the feds to regulate medical use anywhere.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. Now you're going to have some limiting --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But a limiting principle is the one that I -- was identified by the Court in Lopez in which the government is asserting that if it's an essential part of a broader regulation of economic activity to reach this activity, then it may be reached. And the difference between states in which there is a state law enforcement that's confining the class, and that there is a discrimination between legal and non-legal use, is completely different from a practical enforcement standpoint than a state in which there is no differentiation. Just think of the existence, for example, of identification cards, which the State of California is going to be issuing, like driver's license cards.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah, but it doesn't right now, and that doesn't make the scheme less valid, in your view.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, because -- but this is the sort of regulation -- the sort of effectiveness of the regulation that will be at issue and which is, in fact -- I believe the Court should be in the position of trusting the State of California to be able to administer its regime. There is no regime in other states to trust, and, therefore, the argument that it is necessary to reach that activity, and a lot of other activity in states in which the states are not attempting to pursue the health of their citizens -- the goal of preserving the health of their citizens this way, that would fall under the exception which this Court suggested in Lopez --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is a new framework, I take it, and it's very interesting. And one of the things that interests me -- I guess, on your framework, Lopez should have come out my way. [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's essential to regulate guns in schools as part of a national gun-control regulatory scheme.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, that's the reason why that exception has to be narrowly treated, so it doesn't reach your result. [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that exception were treated as broadly as you suggested that it should be in your dissent in Morrison, then the game is up, the exception will swallow the rule, and Lopez and Morrison will be limited to their facts.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought we didn't need to reach all that here, for the reason that the connection here, which is an enforcement-related connection and a market-related connection, is actually, I have to confess, a little more obvious and a little more close than what I had to -- what I had to say in Lopez to -- was the connection between guns, education, communities, and business. So I would have thought, given the -- and I believe that, you know -- but, I mean -- but that was far further than this, which is just direct.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But this case is completely unlike those cases. This case is completely isolated. In Lopez, that gun probably did come through interstate commerce, not that I believe it should have made any difference, but it probably did. Here, we're talking about substances that don't. So there's just no literal connection between this class of activities and this interstate market.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we didn't decide that, in Lopez, on the basis of whether the gun had come in interstate commerce. If the statute in question had applied only to guns that had been transported in interstate commerce, the case might have come out differently.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- no doubt, Your -- I -- and I wasn't suggesting otherwise, Justice Scalia. I'm just suggesting that, here, we have -- exactly, that if there had been that interstate connection in Lopez, the case might have come out different. There is no interstate connection whatsoever in this class of cases. None. The only way to make it an interstate connection is through some sort of hypothetical economic substitution effect in which somebody who's doing something over here is going to have an affect on somebody else who's doing something over there. There is no connection.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sounds like Wickard to me.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Wickard, Your Honor --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I always used to laugh at Wickard, but that's -- that's what Wickard said.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Wickard --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Had he not eaten the wheat, it would have been in interstate commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Had that case been about eating wheat, that case would never have arisen.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's what it was about, as far as the Court's analysis was concerned. To be sure, there were a lot of -- there was a lot more use of the wheat on his farm, other than just human consumption, but it seems to me the analysis of the case said, "You take it -- you take it out of the stream of commerce by growing it yourself, you make it unnecessary for your -- to buy it in interstate commerce."
03-1454 +++$+++ 4294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's -- the entire analysis -- the entire proof that the court relied upon in Wickard was proof of the economic impact of home-consumed wheat on the farms. And by "home-consumed," it did not mean eating at the family -- at the family table; it meant feeding to your livestock and then putting it -- your livestock --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Strange phrase, to mean "feeding to livestock"?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ "Home-consumed" is feed it to your pig?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, yes, that's exactly what --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4300 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that's exactly what that general term -- how that general term was used in this case.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4301 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what the Court said, I take it -- and I have quoted a lot of the language there -- it says that the wheat farmer's consumption of home-grown wheat, not the part that went in -- quote, "though it may not be regarded as commerce" --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- end quote, still can be regulated, quote, "whatever its nature," so long as, quote, "it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce." Now, that's the language, and I take it that Justice Scalia is exactly right, I thought, from that language, it's about the analysis, home-grown wheat, which is not economic, having an effect on something that is.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With all respect --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which is not commerce. Sorry, not commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With all respect, what -- that's -- I was about to make that --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the Commerce Clause speaks in terms of commerce.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. Right. What the Court was using here was the narrower -- the traditional definition of "commerce" that Justice Thomas has been urging this Court to adopt. And they were saying that, "We are not going to limit ourselves to that narrow definition of 'commerce.'" It would include, for example, agriculture and production. That's all going to be reachable, even though it's not commerce, in the traditional sense. But what we would call it today, and I believe what the Court correctly called it, in Lopez, was "economic activity." Production is economic activity. Manufacturing is economic activity. But -- it's not commerce, but it's economic activity that can be reached. And that is the activity -- that's not only the activity that Farmer Filburn was engaged in; that was the activity that the statute was aimed at. The statute --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, why is this not economic activity, if you use the term in that broad sense? This marijuana that is grown, just like the wheat that was grown, in Wickard, since it's grown on the farm, doesn't have to be bought elsewhere, and that makes it an economic activity.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What made it an economic activity in Wickard was the fact that it was part of commercial enterprise, that it was being used on the farm -- not in interstate commerce, but part of the commercial enterprise of the farm.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Again, I don't think that's -- that faithfully represents what the opinion said. I think the opinion covered -- including the amount that he consumed himself, and his family consumed.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- look, I -- for whatever it's worth, it's worth remembering that the statute exempted small commercial farms. People who had backyard gardens weren't even included within the regulatory regime. The regulatory regime was about regulating or stopping or restricting the supply of wheat that got into the market, or that could have --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did the opinion make a point of that?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Pardon me?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did the opinion make a point of that?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it was mentioned in the opinion. It was not -- it was not a major point of this opinion. But --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think it was a point of the Court's analysis at all.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could I -- could I --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could I ask this question. What is your view with respect to the impact of the activities concerned in this case on the interstate market for marijuana? Is it your view that it will have no impact, that it will increase the interstate demand, or decrease the interstate demand? So there are three alternatives. Which is the one we should follow?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I pick "trivial impact"? [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but if it -- "trivial impact," is it a trivial impact that enhances the price of marijuana or decreases the price of marijuana, in your view?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The only effect it could have on the price would be a slight trivial reduction, if it has any effect at all, because it's going to withdraw users from the illicit drug market. And to the extent that they are now in the illicit drug market -- and we don't know whether they are or not --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that would reduce demand and increase price, it seems to me. It's the other way around.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it would reduce demand and reduce prices, I think. But --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you reduce demand, you reduce prices? Are you sure?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, you're right. You're right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your whole argument for triviality, though, goes -- your whole argument for triviality, though, goes back to your disagreement with the government about how many people are involved, because I take it you accept the assumption that the more people who are involved -- if there are millions and millions, it is unlikely that this licensed activity is going to be without an effect on the market. So the whole argument boils down to how many people are going to be involved. You don't accept the government's 100,000-dollar figure. Let me ask you a question that would -- that would get to, maybe, a different number, and that is, do you know how many people there are in California who are undergoing chemotherapy at any given time?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I do not know the answer to that.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't that number going to be indicative of the demand for marijuana?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It could be, Your Honor, but that also illustrates --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if you -- if you accept that, then there's nothing implausible about the government's hundred-thousand number, is there?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But whatever -- I don't know, because I don't know the number of people using chemotherapy. But whatever the number --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How many people are there in California? What's the population?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thirty-four million.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4337 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Kennedy.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4338 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Lots -- lots -- [Laughter.]
03-1454 +++$+++ 4339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- lots and lots. They -- a hundred-thousand cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy does not seem like an implausible number. And, in fact, if that number is a plausible one today, its plausibility reflects, among other things, the fact that there is a controversy as to whether California's law, in fact, is enforceable, or not. And the reason -- there is reason to assume that -- if we ruled your way, that that number would go up. So, if you accept that line of argument, then your argument, that the effect, whatever it may be, is going to be trivial, seems to me unsupportable. Am I missing something?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, two things. First of all, whatever number it is, it's going to be confined to people who are sick, who are sick enough to use this. That is not an infinitely expandable number, the way, for example, recreational activity is, where lots of people could just decide to do it. We're talking about people who qualify, on a physician's recommendation, for this particular activity. That will limit the number. But the amount of the people -- the effect on commerce only matters if the Wickard v. Filburn aggregation principle applies to the class of activities in this case, and it does not apply to the class of activities in this case if they are non-economic, as we assert that they are.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well -- but that is circular reasoning, because the whole -- your whole argument that it's non-economic is based on the claim that there are -- the numbers are so few -- the number of people involved, from what you could generalize, are so few that it would not be reasonable to infer an effect on the market. If there would be a large market effect, it makes no more sense to call this non-economic than Filburn's use, non-economic.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4342 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Lopez and Morrison stand for the proposition that activities that simply have an effect on the market are not necessary -- that does not make them economic. This Court rejected that proposition, that just because an activity has an effect -- an economic effect makes the activity, itself, economic. It adopted a principle that's less than --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4343 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Remote, remote, remote economic effect.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4344 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was inference upon inference upon inference. That's not what we're talking about here.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4345 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But just -- just have it -- just -- whether an activity is economic, you have to look to the activity, itself, and an economic activity is one that's associated with sale, exchange, barter, the production of things for sale and exchange, barter. This whole Court's jurisprudence since The New Deal has been premised on the ability to tell the difference between economic activity, on the one hand, and personal liberty, on the other.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But your whole jurisprudence in this case is premised on the assumption that we have got to identify the entire range of potential effect based on the particular character of two individuals in their -- in their supply of marijuana. And the whole point of this argument is that that does not seem to be a realistic premise on which to base constitutional law.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The premise of our -- the premise of our economic claim is the nature of the activity involved, not necessarily its effect, but the kind of activity it is. The idea -- for example, you -- prostitution is an economic activity. Marital relations is not an economic activity. We could be talking about virtually the same act. And there is a market overhang for -- from private sexual relations to prostitution, but we don't say that because there is a market for prostitution, that, therefore, everything that is not in that market is economic. We look at the activities, and we --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'd like to ask you one question about the activity --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- which was brought up before, and I just -- I've never understood this. I'm not an expert. I don't honestly know, if I really think about it, despite all the papers and so forth, whether it's true that medical marijuana is helpful to people in ways that pills are not. I really don't know. So I would have thought that the people, like your clients, who have a strong view about it, would go to the FDA, and they would say to the FDA, "FDA, take this off the list. You must take it off the list if it has an accepted medical use and it isn't lacking in safety." The FDA will say yes or it will say no. If it says yes, they win. If they say no, they can come right into court and say, "That's an abuse of discretion." The Court says yes or no. If it says yes, they win. If it says no, it must be because it wasn't an abuse of discretion, in which case, I, as a judge, and probably as a person, would think it isn't true that marijuana has some kind of special use. So that would seem to me to be the obvious way to get what they want. That seems to me to be relevant to the correct characterization. And while the FDA can make mistakes, I guess medicine by regulation is better than medicine by referendum.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So that's -- I just want to know why.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, first of all, that whole process wouldn't dictate what the power of Congress is to reach this activity --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's all true, but as long as that hasn't been done, don't I have to take this case on the assumption that there is no such thing as medical marijuana that's special and necessary?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If has been done, maybe I shouldn't make it.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- I would simply ask Your Honor to read the amicus brief by Rick Doblin, in which it describes the government's obstruction of scientific research that would establish the safety and efficacy of cannabis by denying supplies of cannabis -- of medical -- of cannabis for medical experimentation. And then I'd ask Your Honor to read the Institute for Medicine's report, that both the government and I -- and we have relied upon in our briefs. There has been no impeachment of this report by the National Academy of Sciences on the medical effect. And what they say is that the -- that what information we have is that cannabis does have a substantial medical effect. Smoked cannabis does carry with it harms associated with it, as the -- as General Clement correctly pointed out. It does carry with it these ancillary harms. But when people are sick and people are suffering and people are dying, they may be willing to run the risk of these long-term harms in order to get the immediate relief, the life-saving relief that cannabis has demonstrably been able to provide. I'd just ask Your Honor to look at that, which is in the record.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are prescriptions, under California law, limited only to those people with life-threatening illnesses?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They are limited to a list of illnesses that are in the statute.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Some of the illnesses --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Some of which are life-threatening and some of which are not, Your Honor.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In one -- in one plaintiff's case, I think, there isn't a life-threatening --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor. She has -- she has severe back spasms and pain that cannot be controlled by conventional medicines. She's a law-abiding citizen. This goes back to the issue of what the -- incentives there are that are created by this. This is a law-abiding woman, who has never been interested in the illicit-drugs market.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I just ask you one procedural question?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And this is -- this is a suit for an injunction. And it -- basically an injunction against a criminal prosecution.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And seizure --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And --
03-1454 +++$+++ 4369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- of these plants.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and there's an old saying, in equity, that courts don't enjoin criminal prosecutions. So how is your injunction suit appropriate, given that old saying meant that you have to make your defense in the criminal proceeding and not enjoin this operation?
03-1454 +++$+++ 4371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it is -- it is an -- we're seeking an injunction to prevent the enforcement of the statute against these two persons, which includes forfeiture, which has already happened in this case. We've already had Diane Monson's plants seized by the Drug Enforcement Authority. That is not something that we -- that we -- that has anything to do with criminal prosecution, and yet that puts at risk her supply of medicine, the supply of medicine she needs to get by, to relieve her suffering. I see my time is up. Thank you.
03-1454 +++$+++ 4372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Barnett. General Clement, you have four minutes.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4380 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument now in No. 03-1488, Ulysses Tory v. Johnnie L. Cochran. Mr. Chemerinsky.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4382 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Good morning. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The injunction in this case violates the most basic principles of the First Amendment. It's a prior restraint. It's a content-based restriction on speech. It's vastly overbroad. It even restricts the speech of those who are not a party to the lawsuit, such as Petitioner Ruth Craft. The injunction in this case is inconsistent with this country's unique and profound commitment that speech by public officials and public figures be open, robust, and uninhibited. One way in which the injunction is clearly unconstitutional is in restricting the speech of those who are not a party to the lawsuit. For example, Ruth Craft is expressly restrained from ever speaking again about Johnnie Cochran even though she was never named as a party to the lawsuit. And, in fact, Cochran's attorney admitted at the beginning of trial, she wasn't a part of the lawsuit.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How about you? You're in trouble too, aren't you? (Laughter.)
03-1488 +++$+++ 4384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I am, Your Honor. This injunction is so broad that if I talk about Johnnie Cochran or this case on the sidewalk in front of this Court or pass out copies of the brief or speak to any reporter, I am violating the terms of the injunction and I could be held in contempt of court.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, you speak about the injunction, and the injunction has three parts. I thought that you were not challenging -- at least the question presented doesn't suggest you're challenging -- the first one that concerns distance, the 300 yard from Cochran or his place of business, and the third one, which is an anti-harassment provision. Do I understand correctly that it is only the second one that you're challenging?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. The question presented is that the injunction is unconstitutional. One of the reasons why the injunction is unconstitutional is that it's based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment. All of the statements that were uttered by Mr. Tory are opinion protected by the First Amendment. There is not the requisite actual malice. And so it's our position that the injunction itself is unconstitutional.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But your question is preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, and the first and third provisions of this injunction do not prohibit all future speech.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, that's correct. It's our position, though, that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment, and we believe that the question presented is that the injunction is impermissible in its restriction of speech.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that isn't what you've said in the question presented. Why shouldn't we be limited to answering the question presented? And that would leave the other parts there.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, of course, you're limited to the question presented. Our position, though, is that the injunction in its restriction of speech is unconstitutional. And one of the reasons why the injunction is unconstitutional is that all of the speech that occurred in this case is speech that's protected by the First Amendment.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but you understand Justice Ginsburg's question surely, and I would imagine that even if you prevail, nothing we would order would affect the first and third parts.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, certainly we believe that the injunction is most clearly unconstitutional in its overbreadth. We believe also and separately the injunction is unconstitutional because injunctions are not a permissible remedy in a defamation case, especially concerning public officials and public figures. But it's also our position that the injunction is based on speech that's protected by the First Amendment, and thus, the injunction violates the First Amendment.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but that doesn't --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, is it true that your client intends to go on defaming Mr. Cochran?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4395 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. We don't believe our client has ever defamed Mr. Cochran. We believe that all of his speech is just opinion.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4396 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does he intend to continue making the same comments that he made before?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4397 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ His exact words were that perhaps he would continue to express his view that Mr. Cochran owes him money.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Now, let me ask you this. Under your theory, if -- if the defendant is judgment-proof, does respondent have any remedy at all if the statements are defamatory?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What is it?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is, of course, a remedy. Since we're dealing here with a public figure, there is the remedy of expressing views which this Court has said in Gertz v. Welch is available to a public figure. There is a damage judgment that's available. Certainly, Your Honor, there can't be a different rule --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if -- if the defendant is judgment-proof, what good does that do?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, there is a damage judgment that forever would be available against the person. And it cannot be, Your Honor, that those who are poor will have injunctions --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- well, your -- your answer should be to Justice O'Connor there is no effective legal remedy under your theory of the case.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, I disagree with that.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, you -- you say he has the remedy of -- of counter-speech. We're talking -- that's really that doesn't answer the question. The question is, is there anything he can get from the courts other than a damage remedy, and your answer I think is no.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor. From the courts, he can get a damage remedy but I don't accept that a damage remedy is inadequate just because a person may be poor. The damage remedy will be that they'd be collected for the person who gets assets in the future. Also, as I was saying to Justice O'Connor, it can't be --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- it seems to me that that really avoids the problem -- the problem. So suppose we disagree with you about that. Then it's true that there is no -- there is no legal remedy that he can get.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But then, Justice Kennedy, it can't be the rule that poor people have their speech enjoined, but those with assets can continue to speak in the future.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it also can't be the rule that poor people can defame ad libitum and -- and people who have money cannot. I mean, that's -- that's not a fair rule either.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, but that's why there would be, of course, the ability of a court to issue a damage judgment. There are many instances in which damage judgments can't be collected.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's worthless against a -- against a person who has no assets.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's true everywhere in the legal system, Your Honor. And I would also argue here that none of Mr. Tory's statements were defamatory. I would point --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now that's another one that is in your brief. You say that these were statements of opinion not fact. But that surely is not presented in your question. You -- you don't -- there were findings made that these statements were defamatory, and your question presented does not seem to me to encompass at all the question whether these statements were defamatory.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would disagree, Your Honor. The question presented is whether this injunction, that forever stops speech, violates the First Amendment. One reason why --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not -- not this injunction. The question presented is whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation -- in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment. There's no suggestion in that that you claim that in this particular case there was no defamation. I -- I just don't think it's fairly included within the question.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, what I am saying is that the question presented does ask whether this injunction, which permanently restricts speech --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, it doesn't. It says whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure violates the First Amendment.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We would argue --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's nothing about this particular injunction which is based upon speech that is not defamation. There's nothing in there about that.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, our position is that question asks whether an injunction violates the First Amendment, and certainly it is about this case. And our position is that all of the speech that was expressed in this case is opinion. And it's important --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Now, if that's so --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- well, there really -- there are findings against you, and to say that a lawyer is a crook, a liar, and a thief and you're trying to tell us that that's not defamatory, I mean, I -- I think we should just proceed on -- on some other basis for this argument. We have other questions to discuss.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. But, Your Honor, I want to just respond to that. The exact statement there was -- and I'll quote it for you and it is on page 54 of the joint appendix. Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief. Can a lawyer go to heaven? Luke 11:46. Your Honor, this Court has said, for example, in Greenbelt Cooperative that charging somebody with blackmail is expressing opinion. In Letter Carriers v. Austin this Court said calling somebody a traitor is opinion.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. That -- that -- what you've quoted many -- much of this I wouldn't repeat in polite company. You've reported one of the most mild, and in fact there are two findings. One, this is not just defamation. It was an action for defamation, as well as a tort of invasion of privacy. And there is a finding, first, that this was done intentionally to create a negatively charged and ominous environment, and this is not a matter of speech-related issues. It is simply the use of false and defamatory and privacy-invading communications, or worse, or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for -- for desisting from that type of activity. All right. Now, those are the findings against you. So suppose I agreed with you hypothetically that that, with all these findings, is nonetheless protected by the First Amendment. All right? Now, suppose, in other words, you convince me of that. Now, I want to know how to write my opinion on that assumption to protect what I was worried about yesterday, that a woman who has a boyfriend or a husband is being continuously harassed in -- with methods similar to this one. See, it's easy to transpose those two cases which are both on my mind. And I want to know if in your opinion that these restraining orders, which try to prevent this kind of thing, among others, are unconstitutional, if there's a way of distinguishing them, if you could possibly win on what theory. And what I'm trying to get you to do is to say is it absolute. Are there limits? If so, what?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would suggest three different ways in which you could write the opinion that distinguished the case. The first is that this injunction is vastly overbroad, that even if there can be an injunction to say that Ulysses Tory and Ruth Craft can never again say anything about Johnnie Cochran in any public forum, that I can never speak about Johnnie Cochran would violate the First Amendment. A second way of distinguishing is that defamation is different, that when the First Amendment was adopted, the clear history was that above all it was to prevent prior restraints, and that injunctions were not permitted in defamation actions. That's quite different than a harassment action. And third, as I've argued, what makes this different is the basis for this injunction is speech protected by the First Amendment. With regard to the findings that you referred to, you mentioned two. The first is invasion of privacy. Your Honor, the only privacy claim in this case was false light invasion of privacy. California law is clear. When there is a defamation action and a false light claim, the false light claim is automatically dismissed as duplicative when it's based on the same fact. The second basis you pointed --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, this case comes up to us from a California appellate court. Surely they know California law better than we do.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, but they did not base their decision on the privacy claim because California law is clear that when it's false light invasion of privacy brought together with a defamation action, the false light claim is dismissed. That's a California case, Couch v. San Jose Unified School District.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we're not going to debate among ourselves over what California law is.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4430 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. All I'm saying is it's important to be clear about what the privacy claim is. As I was saying to Justice Breyer, there may be privacy claims that give rise to injunctions. Harassment claims may give rise to injunctions, but not the privacy claim in this case which was just about false light, which even the California Court of Appeal admitted is treated together with defamation.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose this picketing had taken place in front of his house, every day in front of his house.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, under Frisby v. Schultz, that would be a different situation. Under Frisby v. Schultz, this Court said --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Well -- well, then this -- this argument you're making, oh, never, never, the sky is falling and so forth, I -- I think we have to be more precise here. I think if it were in front of his house, it would be different. If he had alleged $10 worth of monetary damages, it would be disparaging the quality of his services, which would be a trade libel, and the Restatement at least -- I don't know California law -- says that you -- would you agree that you can enjoin a trade libel --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that disparages quality of goods to the serious injury of a -- of a business?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Actually, Your Honor, the vast majority of cases have held that you cannot have an injunction for product defamation. And so I think while that's a different and more difficult question, most courts have said no even there. And Your Honor, I'm not saying there can never be injunctions. But I am saying that this Court has said there's a very strong and heavy presumption against injunctions, and that never, not once in the 214-year history of the First Amendment, has this Court ever upheld an injunction as a remedy in a defamation action. And, Your Honor --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if -- if this under -- the underlying claim seems to be that Mr. Cochran is essentially being blackmailed; that is, this -- this -- your client wants tribute to go away. And you say, yes, but it's defamation. It's a defamation action. Therefore, damages is the only remedy. Is there nothing that one can do to stop another from engaging in blackmail?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, there is. If this was blackmail or extortion, Johnnie Cochran could have filed a criminal complaint with the police. He could have civilly sued for blackmail or extortion. But, Your Honor, this wasn't extortion.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What kind of a jurisprudence is it that a person can go to jail but that he's freed from an injunction? I mean, why -- why do we do this?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Your Honor, that's because this Court has said that injunctions of speech are even worse than criminal penalties. I would refer this Court --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but why -- is that true in every case? I mean, take the timid person who's not sure -- I know the law doesn't protect the timid person in the first area, but let's -- let's assume the timid person is not sure. So he wants -- he wants to get an equitable ruling first, declaratory judgment. He -- and he would take an injunction. That's certainly much easier than going to jail.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, I'd remind you of this Court's language in the Vance v. Universal Amusement where the Court said presumption against prior restraints is heavier and the degree of protection broader than against limits on criminal penalties.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I know, but I'm asking you why that -- why that should be. If -- if you asked a person not familiar with our jurisprudence, which is worse, having an injunction that you can argue about or going to jail, I -- I think they would say that going to jail is worse.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, in terms of the First Amendment, there are reasons why an injunction has always been regarded as worse.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Always? Do you want to apply that to an harassment action too against a woman who has the restraining order? No restraining orders in divorce cases in case they're against speech because even if violence is threatened, even if -- et cetera. I mean, how -- how far do you want to push that principle?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't want to push the principle at all to harassment. I believe that injunctions are completely appropriate in harassment actions. I think it is quite important to note that the California harassment statute expressly excludes speech which is protected by the First Amendment as being a basis for harassment. The history of the First Amendment is different. To go back to Justice Kennedy's question, it's always been thought that an injunction strikes at the very heart of the First Amendment because, as Justice Scalia pointed out --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why can't we say that speech that is -- is being used for extortion is different, just as speech which is being used for harassment is different? And just as you can get an injunction for the latter, you ought to be able to get an injunction for the former. Not all speech, but only when speech is being used to -- to extort money.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, there can be an injunction for extortion, but this was not extortion. There was never the criminal complaint. There was never the civil action. And it didn't meet the requirements for extortion. Your Honor, California law, Penal Code section 518, defines extortion as, quote, the obtaining of property from another with his consent induced by a wrongful use of force or fear. There wasn't the wrongful use of force or fear. Now, it may be that Ulysses Tory was speaking --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Here I think there was -- why isn't there a use of fear when, you know, you're afraid of this person destroying your business by calling you a liar and a cheat? Wasn't Mr. Cochran afraid of that -- of that happening?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, this Court is required to do an independent review of the record under Bose v. Consumers Union. There's no indication that Mr. Cochran suffered that fear from Mr. Tory being outside. It's true that Mr. Tory may have believed that he was owed money by Johnnie Cochran and was also trying to encourage Mr. Cochran to pay. But this Court has said in cases like NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware speech does not lose its protective character simply because it may embarrass others or coerce them into action.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, the district -- I mean, the trial court made certain findings and I'm looking at page 42 of the joint appendix. The first is that these statements were actually made for the purpose of inducing Cochran to pay Tory amounts of money which Tory was not entitled. That's one finding. And then finding 24, despite repeated requests, Tory has refused to cease picketing unless he was paid money -- a monetary settlement by Cochran. And then 27 that says this is simply use of false and privacy-invading communications to coerce or attempt to improperly coerce payment of money in tribute for desisting from that type of activity. And those sound like findings. It's true that the label of extortion has been put on it, but it certainly does sound like the -- that the purpose of the speech was to extract money not owed.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, since this is a defamation action, not an extortion action, the rules under the First Amendment for defamation have to apply. Under the rules of the First Amendment for defamation, injunctions are not available to public officials or public figures.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, so this finding -- the court shouldn't have made these findings? It was irrelevant?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I believe that the --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was there an objection to the testimony that established this?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Tory, who was appearing pro se in the trial court, from the very outset objected that he was being held liable for speech protected by the First Amendment.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but it seems to me -- and I think what bothers me is -- is what bothers Justice Kennedy. It seems to me that the argument you just made is an argument that given the pleadings in this case, the findings that Justice Ginsburg just quoted really were irrelevant findings, that they should not have gotten -- that the court should not have gotten into extortion and so on and should not have provided a remedy for extortion, quite apart from the fact of whether it's an appropriate remedy, constitutional or otherwise. And that, it seems to me, is -- is something that we -- we are not here to touch. That's a question of California law. What we are here to touch is, number one, whether the injunction is overbroad with respect to pure speech, and maybe we are here -- that we have a question about the -- the breadth of the case we took. But maybe we are here to determine whether there can be an injunction against blackmail or harassing activities. But I -- I think we're not here to decide whether California could have gotten to the question of blackmail, harassment, and injunction for that. Do you agree with that?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. I certainly agree with the first point. One issue before this Court is whether this injunction is overbroad, and it clearly is in terms of the breadth of speech that's regulated and whose regulated. But as to the second point that you make, this is a defamation action, and thus the issue before this Court, clearly presented in the question presented, is whether a permanent injunction can be issued in a defamation case remedy when the plaintiff is a public figure.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it can certainly -- the -- the issue is certainly before us as to whether such an injunction can be issued with respect to defamation pure and simple. But the findings that Justice Ginsburg has -- has read and part of the order in question here seems to go beyond pure defamation. It goes to the kind of demonstrative activity which plausibly is found to have been in aid of extortion. And that, it seems to me, is an entirely different question. We may -- I'm not saying we will, but we may agree with you that it's overbroad. We may agree with you that as to pure speech, you can't enjoin it. But that doesn't necessarily mean that every part of this injunction is wrong, and it seems to me it is irrelevant as to whether the -- the State of -- the courts of California should have reached extortion.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would disagree in this way, Your Honor. Bose v. Consumers Union makes clear that when it is a defamation action, this Court and every appellate court has to do an independent review of the record.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With respect to the defamation, pure and simple. I agree with you. We -- there is a heightened standard of review, but I don't think that addresses one way or the other what the standard should be when an action in the State courts has been treated as an action both for defamation and for extortion or harassment.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, it was not treated here as an action for extortion or harassment --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand. Mr. Chemerinsky, let me put the question this way. Suppose a State does not have a civil action for extortion. It provides criminal remedies but no civil action for extortion. Why does the Constitution not permit us to treat, in that State at least, a civil action for defamation which has within it elements of distortion differently from pure defamation?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I would say the history of the First Amendment is different. A State can create a civil action then for extortion at the urging of this Court, but if you open the door to injunctions in defamation cases, then there's the possibility that in any defamation case, somebody might plead something about extortion, and injunctions will not be rare but will be the norm.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask this -- may I ask this question? Supposing the only thing he did was to carry a sign that said Johnnie is a crook, a liar, and a thief, and the trial judge finds that is false, and he's carrying it in a sign, could the trial judge enjoin him from carrying that sign in front of Johnnie Cochran's office?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, because the law is clear that injunctions are not a permissible remedy in defamation cases.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What's the best authority you have for that proposition?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Near v. Minnesota would be the best authority where this Court said clearly that injunctive relief should not be awarded in a defamation case.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Add to Justice Stevens' -- add to Justice Stevens' hypothetical that he shows that he's losing some clients.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, even -- yes, Your Honor. But I don't think that changes the hypothetical in terms of enjoining the defamatory speech.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would you add too that he's judgment-proof?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, again, as I said to Justice O'Connor, I don't think it can matter whether he's judgment-proof because we can't have a different rule that we allow poor people's speech to enjoin and not wealthy people.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're saying -- you're saying that a State cannot constitutionally prohibit someone from making false statements in front of the business that causes the business to lose money.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, there are other causes of action that may allow that. If it could be --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So I'm -- my question is, is this constitutional to prohibit this conduct?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not in a defamation action, Your Honor.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that's not the question.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what is your authority for that proposition?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I would say that the authority comes from the fact that never in 214 years has this Court ever upheld an injunction in a defamation case.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Have we ever set aside an injunction that did that?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, not under those facts.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Have we done it either way?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. That's correct, Your Honor.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Have we ever -- have we ever considered a case where there's a strong element of extortion involved?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would say yes, extortion for Austin v. Keith. There was speech to pressure, and yet this Court said even though the speech was to pressure, it's still protected by the First Amendment. I'd like to save the rest of the time for rebuttal, if that's permissible.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Very well, Mr. Chemerinsky.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Cole, we'll hear from you.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4492 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, and may it please the Court: For years, Mr. Tory has relentlessly targeted Johnnie Cochran with a pattern of defamatory speech in a public forum for purpose of causing Mr. Cochran to pay Mr. Tory money in tribute for ceasing from this unprotected activity. He admitted at trial he intended to engage in this conduct. He was doing it just so he could be paid money, and when asked if he would continue to do so, he stated he would.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, do you -- do you defend the injunction in its entirety?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, the -- the -- Mr. Chemerinsky didn't have too much chance to -- to get very far into it, but one of his points was that there was -- quite apart from any injunction against picketing, harassment, et cetera, there was an injunction simply against speech on a given subject directed to a lot of people with no limit of time. With respect to that last aspect, do you defend the injunction?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. First of all, I don't believe it was directed to a lot of people. As this --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it was directed, number one, to a named person who was not a party to the case, and it was directed to agents and employees of -- of the named party. So, I -- I assume that Mr. Cochran probably has a fair number of agents and employees, so it does seem like a large number of people.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I believe this Court said in Madsen that that would raise an abstract controversy that Mr. Tory doesn't have standing to attack the injunction for other persons who are not before the court. No aider or abetter has ever been served with this injunction. Ms. Craft has never been served with this injunction. Only Mr. Tory. So I don't believe --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let me ask you a law school question. In -- given the injunction on its face, with that breadth, is that injunction defensible with respect not to picketing, not to harassment, simply to speech in a public place?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I defend the injunction, and respondent defends the injunction on the ground that it is conduct that was being enjoined --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I asked you --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- from the use of unprotected speech.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to exclude the -- the issue of conduct. I said forget the injunction for a moment with respect to picketing, with respect to harassment, and we'll say with respect to blackmail, since that has come up. Forget that. Simply take the portion of the injunction that enjoins speech by these people, associates, agents, et cetera. On the subject matter of the injunction for all time, do you defend that injunction?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4504 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, we defend the injunction.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4505 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let's take specifically the words of the injunction. It's against orally uttering statements about Cochran, just orally uttering statements about Cochran.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You say that someone can be enjoined --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Based upon the unique facts of this case, Justice Ginsburg, I say somebody can be enjoined. I don't say that in the abstract.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you can't square that with the Near case at all. I -- I mean, the -- the injunction on its face in part 2 has the appearance of being overly broad.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But in Near, they set forth certain factors, and those factors included that it was not a private redress of private wrongs. The information was of legitimate public concern. Neither of those elements are present in this action.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4511 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You don't know that.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You don't --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You don't know what future speech is going to be. His future thing may be, you know, Johnnie Cochran shouldn't be elected mayor of San Francisco. That would be a -- a question of public concern.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, Justice Scalia, what I'm relying on is the fact that he has engaged in 3 years in a pattern of continuing, repetitive conduct.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what -- what you're saying is that an -- an injunction can be overbroad based on past wrongful conduct. And there is simply no authority for that proposition.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not suggesting that this injunction is necessarily overboard based upon that proposition because I believe there are --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But we have just pointed out that it -- that it -- it prohibits lawful, harmless, truthful speech.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I disagree with that, Justice Kennedy.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it does on its face. I mean, it is clearly overbroad. Now, what should we do about that?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if you're asking me, based upon the breadth of the injunction, what I -- if -- if there was -- are you asking me what I would do to modify the injunction? You could merely strike -- you could leave intact paragraph 2 and you could strike simply subsections (ii) and (iii) as being unconstitutionally overbroad.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, let -- let me ask you about that. Let's -- let's assume, for the moment, that a majority of the Court would find that some of these provisions are overly broad. Is there any authority that tells us what to do next? This is not like a statute where we have to save the statute. Do we have any obligation to save the injunction? Send it back and let it be done. Let it be done all over again. I mean, why -- why should we rewrite it up here? Do you have any authority that requires us or permits us to do that?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. In -- in Madsen, Justice Kennedy, you struck -- the Court struck certain provisions as being unconstitutionally overbroad and left certain intact. So there's no reason why you can't look at this injunction, which clearly does not attack paragraph 1. The -- they do not attack paragraph 1. They do not attack paragraph 3. They only level their attack at paragraph 2, and paragraph 2, by striking subsections (ii) and (iii), would then be limited to the exact conduct in issue, which is picketing.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So -- so if -- before leaving that point, what the injunction prohibits is that Tory and those acting in concert, cooperation, or participation with him from, in a public forum, orally uttering statements about Cochran. All right. That's what it says. Now, do you think that if Tory or someone acting in cooperation with him says, I've had a change of heart, Johnnie Cochran is a marvelous person, and he says that on television -- do you think that individual at that time has violated this injunction?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely not.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely not. Because? Because?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ First of all, that's --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It said the words. They violated the words. It was a statement, but he has not violated the injunction because?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because I don't believe that's a public forum.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, no, no. He does it in a public forum. In fact, he hires Disney Hall. (Laughter.)
03-1488 +++$+++ 4530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And moreover, he gets on stage and announces it. Okay? There's no problem about a public forum. So, now, why doesn't it violate the injunction?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your -- Your Honor, I believe there are alternative channels of communication here.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I thought what you were going to say -- but you're not. So I'm very interested in that, and I'm glad I asked. I thought you were going to say when it says uttering statements, it means statements of the kind or identical to those we have identified earlier in this opinion.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I was --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, now, you haven't said that. I said it, and I think it's too late for you to say it. (Laughter.)
03-1488 +++$+++ 4535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think I said it when I said there was a continuing pattern of repetitive conduct under Pittsburgh Press, over 3 years that that was the conduct that he has engaged in. And that was clearly the purpose of this injunction, Justice Breyer. We know that. And the purpose of the injunction is to enjoin conduct that's designed to extort money from Mr. Cochran.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In more than one case, we've said that an injunction has to be precise and clear and not leaving things to the imagination.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think this is precise and clear. Based upon the breadth of the injunction, it's very clear. Based upon this man's prior repetitive conduct of defaming Mr. Cochran with unprotected speech for the purpose of attempting to extort money from him --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's -- it's --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But nothing in the injunction refers to prior conduct.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. It's --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The injunction just speaks for itself. It doesn't say what -- doing what you used to do or anything like that.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The injunction --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You cannot picket Cochran or Cochran's law firm. Period.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If we restricted the injunction to specific words used such as you cannot picket Johnnie Cochran's law firm and say he's a crook, liar, and thief, the response will be that he'll come up with five new words to defame Mr. Cochran for purposes of extorting --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, maybe there are different grades of specificity. Maybe it doesn't meet precisely the same words, but I think there are other ways to draft it that say no picketing. Period.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there could be no picketing for purposes of -- no -- which contains defamatory speech for purposes of extorting Mr. Cochran. But --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All I'm suggesting is just draft it -- just excising (ii) and (iii) from paragraph 2 would not necessarily solve the problem completely. Because subparagraph (i) says picketing Cochran or Cochran's law firm, which is a pretty broad prohibition.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I would disagree based upon the prior -- continuing course of -- of repetitive conduct and the fact that this -- over a period 3 years, once a week, this man spent 3 to 4 hours a day of his time defaming Mr. Cochran at his law office. When we enjoined him from doing so at his law office, he moved it to the Los Angeles Superior Court. And I think the fact that Mr. Cochran is a public figure actually favors the breadth of this injunction. If this was not a public figure, then the public forum issue would not be as effective. But because Mr. Cochran is a public figure, the only way he gets protection is in the public forum because this gentleman could move his picketing down to west L.A., Santa Monica Boulevard, nowhere near a courthouse, and to a public figure he can inflict the same damage to reputation. And that is the problem we were contending with in attempting to draft an injunction that was not overbroad and yet could control Mr. Tory --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- you did draft this injunction. It wasn't the -- an inspiration from the judge unaided by your advocacy. Is that so?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This -- the terms of this injunction.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Were aided -- were aided by my advocacy, Your Honor.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Aided and abetted.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well said, Justice Rehnquist. What I'm suggesting here is Mr. Cochran would have been faced with -- he has no remedy. Injunctive relief is the only remedy. And he would be faced with a multiplicity of actions --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why? Why couldn't he just be enjoined from -- from similar defamation? I mean, this -- this enjoins him from -- from true speech. At least he could -- he could have been enjoined from in the future defaming Cochran in the same manner. And if he did that, then -- then he could be punished.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think we would be -- that injunction then would be attacked on being vague or ambiguous, that Mr. Tory wouldn't have sufficient notice as to what he was allowed to say and not allowed to say. I guarantee you that was --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if -- if that's so, then maybe Mr. Chemerinsky is right. We -- we shouldn't have injunctions. If you're saying that injunctions can't be narrowly tailored, it seems to me that you're playing right into the argument that the petitioner is making.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I think they can be tailored. I just don't think they can be that narrowly tailored. And I don't think in this case, which I believe that the test we should be applying if we're going to balance, is this -- there's no need for this injunction to be drafted in the least restrictive means. I also continue to advance the argument that this -- the facts of this case are unique. It's the use of speech to engage in unprotected conduct. This -- this conduct is not protected by the First Amendment. The conduct of attempting to extort money from Mr. Cochran is not protected. If that is not protected, then I believe we can craft --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You can -- you can certainly have, you know, some unprotected speech in connection with extortion, like give me $5 million or I'll shoot you. But that -- this was a far cry from that. In other words, it isn't just addressing the victim and saying give me something. It's denouncing the victim, which gets into free speech here.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It certainly does, Justice Rehnquist. But what I am suggesting is there was no remedy for Mr. Cochran that would have avoided a multiplicity of actions other than to draft the injunction in a form that would preclude Mr. Tory from engaging in the same conduct without regard to whether it was -- and to let him know clearly -- give him a safe harbor as to what he could and could not say.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the injunction isn't limited to the same conduct.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4562 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I don't think it needs to be because of the pattern and practice that this man has engaged in over 3 years. And if we take the example, which is so he has a change of heart and suddenly he now wants to praise Mr. Cochran and that's become his -- and he's going to promote him as mayor of San Francisco, he can certainly go into the court and modify the injunction.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought he lived in L.A. (Laughter.)
03-1488 +++$+++ 4564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think he'd like to get him up to San Francisco. (Laughter.)
03-1488 +++$+++ 4565 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He can certainly seek to modify the injunction, and that, as I pointed out in a subsequent letter brief, there's -- California doesn't adopt the collateral bar rule. And therefore, he has a check and balance in this case. Under People v. Gonzales, 12 Cal.4th 805, the collateral bar rule has no application in the State of California. So in the unlikely event that Mr. Tory was engaged in speech praising Mr. Cochran, one, and two, in the -- in the more unlikely event that someone was going to attempt to cite him for contempt for engaging in protected speech, he could contest, under First Amendment grounds, the enforcement of this injunction in the State of California because the collateral bar rule has no impact.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4566 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm -- I'm baffled by that. What you're saying is that the injunction -- we're just all wasting our time? The injunction doesn't mean anything?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4567 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no, no. Justice Kennedy, all I'm saying is --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I fell off the track here.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All I'm -- all I'm saying is that if the collateral bar rule was in effect, you would waive your right to contest. You don't have a right to contest the constitutionality of the injunction on First Amendment grounds or constitutional grounds when it's seek to be enforced against you. That's not a defense in a contempt proceeding. California does not adopt that rule. Therefore, Mr. Tory can always -- if he is engaged in protected speech, he can easily contend --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, yes, but he's different from other citizens because he's at -- he's at risk of a contempt citation.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't dispute that.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, his speech is being chilled with -- with respect to protected speech.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there's nothing unusual --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So the collateral bar rule doesn't help you at all because he's subject to a contempt citation.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He's subject to it, but there's a check and balance there in terms of when you balance, the potential remedy for Mr. Cochran -- what -- what is going to give Mr. Cochran the remedy he needs? And if we balance that against the -- the breadth of this injunction, I think we have to look at -- one of the biggest concerns about prior restraints, when analyzed in terms of injunctions, is the collateral bar rule.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it would be so easy. I mean, it's virtually no burden. I take it what you're saying is that this injunction in paragraph 2 at its heart is aimed at in public forums, keeping insults suggesting he was a crook against Johnnie Cochran unless you pay me $10,000. Then I'll stop. Okay? Now, at its heart, that's what it's aimed at.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's exactly --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you are saying if in fact it's ever enforced outside that heartland, you can have a defense. It would violate the First Amendment. But since it's so easy just to write those words we just said right in paragraph 2, why shouldn't the judge have to do it? It's so easy. Say this is aimed at the heartland just as I said it and you said it, and it doesn't apply outside of it.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I have no dispute with that, Justice Breyer. I agree that was the whole purpose for the injunction. That's the basis of the injunction. And you could always remand for further proceedings, consistent with any opinion you would write, that the injunction has to be tailored to -- to deal with defamatory conduct, which is designed to extort or with the intent to extort. And I --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's what he's arguing. You're -- you're conceding that it's overbroad.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm saying if this Court -- well, I'm gleaning the impression that this Court thinks it's overbroad.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ah, you're very perceptive. (Laughter.)
03-1488 +++$+++ 4583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And having gleaned that perception, I'm trying to suggest that, number one, there was no attack on paragraphs 1 and 3, and now we're focused on paragraph 2. And paragraph 2 can be tailored, as you have indicated, Justice Scalia, I think consistent with First Amendment issues. And I think it's important to point out that if we take away injunctive relief in a defamation action in this day -- modern age --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're sort of saying the opposite of what your opponent said. If we take it away, has it ever been there?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's never been there.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What are we taking away?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I agree it's never -- you've never found it there and you've never said it can't be there.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How does California work in that respect? Because what I've been thinking of in my mind is that maybe we shouldn't decide this in terms of State law boxes, that California seems to have an action. Let's call it a buzz action to get away from words. And what that action is it's a defamation but a certain kind. It's defamation accompanied by extortion. And when you have defamation accompanied by extortion -- call it whatever you want -- an injunction is proper in these circumstances. Now, can we decide it in such a way that we're not talking about all defamation actions? We are talking about this beast in California which uses the word defamation but also finds injunction and therefore issues -- also finds extortion and therefore issues an injunction.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, I think that you could limit the injunction to defamatory speech of a similar nature designed to extort.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would -- would that make Mr. Cochran happy? What -- what's the big deal about extortion? I mean, suppose this same conduct occurs in the future, but he doesn't say I'll stop if you give me a lot of money. He just pickets every day and says Cochran is a shyster, don't do any business with Cochran. Do you think Mr. Cochran would be any -- any happier simply because the guy says I'll -- hasn't said I'll stop if you pay me $10,000?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, and I think that would be subject to the same injunctive relief. I think this case is unique with the extortion element, but I don't disagree, Justice Scalia, that that is why any decision that says injunctions in defamation actions would be improper. I think people would start defaming with impunity.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You've got to give us some line. I mean, the only reason we're grabbing onto extortion is that -- that there's reluctance to say you can issue injunctions in all defamation actions. Now, what -- what limitation do you want to place upon the ability to issue an injunction if it is not defamation combined with extortion?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think you need to place a limitation other than you can enjoin the defamatory conduct. Take, for example, the Internet. A posting goes on of a -- of a business that -- a startup company. It can't -- damages of -- for a startup company -- they're very difficult to prove.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But then you run into the public figure. I mean, that's a much more dangerous kind of rule of law, isn't it? I mean, a pure defamation action against a public figure, which they want to say this is. You can write all kinds of things about public figures. People can and do, for better or for worse. Do -- is there any authority for issuing in a pure defamation action an injunction?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There's no authority, but there's no authority that says you can't do it. But what I am suggesting is in -- is in a pure defamation action that's not tied to any specific wrongful conduct, there's no reason why you couldn't enjoin. For example, if you found that a specific item was defamatory on its face, such as a posting on the Internet, the only way to get that posting off the Internet would be to enjoin it because damages aren't going to solve the problem. And if it's -- even if it's purely defamatory, you could restrict it to that purely defamatory posting, similar to -- to the obscenity cases where you've reviewed a film, you found it to be obscene, and then you preclude it. There are procedural safeguards and you preclude it in the future.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you've just said something that I think that's inconsistent with your earlier presentation. You said you could enjoin that posting. Here you said it wouldn't be effective just to enjoin the particular placards that were used, the particular words because then there would be other words. So the same question could come up with an Internet posting if you had an injunction not simply on what was posted but anything about this particular individual that might be posted in the future.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, I think where that leaves us is you'd have to engage in some sort of balancing about the -- how narrowly tailored the injunction is and does it provide a sufficient remedy and, you know -- and -- and in this -- and what test we would analyze it under, strict scrutiny, intermediate scrutiny, or the Ward test. And -- and I think that in applying those tests, you'd have to come to a balance, and if the balance is that you're going to limit it to a specific type of speech or -- then that -- that would be a -- a reasonable limit, and if it creates a multiplicity of actions, well, so be it. But at least there's a remedy for that posting or postings of a similar nature. So --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, you -- you -- to the extent that you're complaining about extortion-like conduct, something else that you drafted -- I'm looking at the complaint on page 7 of the joint appendix. You have identified all defamatory, including with the false light invasion of privacy, but you don't have any claim that looks like blackmail.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you'd -- if I could direct you, Justice Ginsburg, to page 12 of the joint appendix at paragraphs (j) and (k) of the verified complaint, you will see that we alleged in a verified complaint that he'd engaged in three previous efforts of this same type of conduct, one. And two, paragraph (k), that Tory is in the business of professionally extorting monies from innocent persons and business --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I was going to ask you about that. Were there findings to substantiate the allegations?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Findings to substantiate --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Specifically about the extorting money from the bank and the oil company.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Justice Kennedy, there were not.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No findings.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There was some testimony only on one of those issues, which was the oil company. There was no findings on this issue. But then I would refer you to paragraph (k) which specifically refers to extorting of monies. And also in my opening statement, as is reflected in the trial's transcript, the -- the first thing I said is this is speech designed for an improper purpose. It's unprotected speech designed to extort money from Mr. Cochran. That was the whole theme --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what -- what I mean is could you have -- without using the label defamation, have stated a claim for extortion or blackmail? I'm not looking at your particular allegations but how you described on page 1 of the complaint what you were suing for: libel, libel per se, slander, slander per se, and invasion of privacy.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think we could have pled extortion had we chose to. We could have pled inference with advantageous business relations. We probably could have pled California's --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does California law require you to label the type of the cause of action or is it notice pleading based on facts?
03-1488 +++$+++ 4609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Notice pleading based on facts, but we do label the causes of action. The -- the point I'm trying to make is whether every cause of action was pled, if the conduct is extortion, which is what the judge implicitly found by findings 20 and 27, that conduct is not protected. And whether we named the cause of action correct in the complaint or we sued for that specified cause of action, doesn't change what it is that we were seeking relief for, which is stopping this man from defaming Mr. Cochran until he was paid money. We attempted to achieve that. We thought we did a fair job in paragraphs 1 and 3, which they don't attack and I agree is not fairly included within the question which has been certified here, nor is an attack on the underlying finding. But we attempted in paragraph 2, broadly I agree, to avoid a multiplicity of actions and to give Mr. Tory other channels of communication other than the public forum where he is engaged in a continuing course of repetitive conduct to defame Mr. Cochran. He -- and -- and this is -- one point that I want to stress. We don't view this injunction as being violated if he went on TV, he went on the radio, he went in the newspapers. We don't view those as public forums under the definition that this Court has provided. Those are not public forums. We are not concerned about that. We do not believe that those events will occur. We did not seek to protect them. So we have given Mr. Tory an unlimited venue to speak, but we said you can't do this in the public forum because of your continuing course of repetitive conduct, 3 years, once a week, 52 times a year, over 150 times, 4 hours a day. And with that, I would submit that while the injunction is broad, I don't believe it's a unconstitutional prior restraint, and to the extent this Court believes it is overbroad, I believe striking subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of paragraph 2 would solve the problem, or alternatively, that in conjunction with a suggestion that it needs to be narrowed to deal with the speech and conduct in issue. Thank you.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Cole. Mr. Chemerinsky, you have 4 minutes remaining.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4612 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. Justice Breyer kindly invited my thoughts about how an opinion might be written, and there are three different ways not mutually exclusive. One is that this injunction is vastly overbroad for all the reasons that have been identified. Mr. Cole said a couple of things. One, he said that Mr. Tory can go to court and ask for modification of the injunction, but that's what makes this a prior restraint, that Mr. Tory can only speak again if he goes to court and gets permission. Also, he said at the end that Mr. Tory can go before the media. However, under California law, under Damon v. Ocean Hill, the media is defined as a public forum. A second way the opinion could be written is that this for speech protected by the First Amendment. Justice Ginsburg, you asked me at the outset whether that's in the scope of the question presented. Well, it is directly relevant to what Mr. Cole was saying. Because it's all opinion, all hyperbole it is protected by the First Amendment and can't be the basis for an extortion claim.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4613 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but you're asking us now to -- the -- the trial court found there was defamation, and now you want to argue, no, it wasn't defamation. It was mere opinion. I really don't see how that's included in the question presented.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4614 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it is because it goes to the question whether the injunction is permissible. But I go on to the third way that the opinion could be written, and that's that injunctions are not permissible as a remedy in a defamation case. We agree that if there is a cause of action for extortion, it can have an injunction as a remedy. We agree if the cause of action is for harassment, there can be an injunction as a remedy. But those have specific elements that have to be met. Those elements weren't met in this case. History is clear that injunctions aren't allowed in defamation cases, and also, Your Honor, it's quite important that Mr. Cole even said you can't craft a narrow injunction in a defamation case. Any injunction is either too narrow or too broad. In Near v. Minnesota, this Court said that it was telling that in 150 years of the history of the First Amendment, there had never been an injunction approved by this Court in a defamation case. We're now 70 years later than that. To approve an injunction in a case like this, even though it's called defamation plus extortion, will open the door to injunctions as a routine matter in defamation cases across the country. No --
03-1488 +++$+++ 4615 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There have been -- there have been injunctions against harassing conduct, threatening, stalking.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, and we have no objection to injunctions of that sort. What we object to is an injunction as a remedy in a defamation case and an injunction that is directed at speech. That's what the First Amendment prohibits. Thank you.
03-1488 +++$+++ 4617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky. The case is submitted.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4621 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll now hear argument in Van Orden against Perry. Mr. Chemerinsky.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4623 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Good morning, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: On the grounds of the Texas State Capitol, there is one evident religious symbol that conveys a powerful religious message that there is a theistic God and that God has committed rules for behavior. Of course, the government may put religious symbols on its property, including the Ten Commandments, but must do so in a way that does not endorse religion or a particular religion, but does not have the purpose of advancing religion, but does not favor any particular religion.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, I suppose that opening statement suggests that you think that Thanksgiving proclamations are also unconstitutional, which were recommended by the very first Congress, the same Congress that proposed the First Amendment.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, I would - I'm sorry.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They also refer to one God, to a theistic ruler of the universe.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, I think the Thanksgiving proclamations would be constitutional. I think it's analogous to the legislative prayers that this Court upheld in Chambers v. Marsh. I think it's very different than this Ten Commandments monument.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. But then you have to narrow your opening statement and say that certainly the State can acknowledge the existence of a unitary God without offending the Establishment Clause.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, but it all depends on how it is done. Here the way in which it is done is the most powerful and profound religious message that this Court has ever considered on government property. Here you have a monument that proclaims not only there is a God, but God has dictated rules for behavior for those who follow him or her.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know whether that's any more profound or ultra-religious, super-religious than the prayer that the chaplain gives every day in the House.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, there is a difference between a prayer that a chaplain gives -- in Chambers v. Marsh, this Court emphasized that the prayer by the chaplain was a nonsectarian prayer. This is very much sectarian. This proclaims that there is a God. It proclaims --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I mean, I haven't read the prayer. So I would be surprised if I went through all the prayers and there was no mention, direct or indirect, of the Ten Commandments or a couple of them.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I would be surprised because here, if you look at these commandments, it's that God has claimed that he is the only God, prohibiting idolatry, prohibiting graven images, prohibiting taking the name of the Lord and God in vain. Requiring observing of the sabbath. This is God dictating to God's followers rules for behavior.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is there any other -- I mean, you can continue if you want, but one difference which I've written down is you say that the difference between this and the prayer is that this is more profoundly religious. Is there any other difference, in your opinion?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I think the key difference is --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the difference? So if I happen to read these prayers in the Congress and I came to the conclusion that in terms of a religious message, I actually thought the prayers had the more religious message, then I should vote against you.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. There are, of course, other differences. As I said to Justice Scalia earlier, with regard to legislative prayer in Chambers versus Marsh, this Court said that there was a history going back to the very first Congress that allowed there to be those kinds of religious invocations. Ten Commandments monuments standing by themselves, as they do here, certainly are not of that historic origin.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How about if they're packaged in a museum-like setting and there is some interest on the part of the State in preserving something.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And displaying a whole variety of things?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, there can be Ten Commandments or any religious works as part of a museum setting. This isn't a museum setting, Your Honor. Every monument on the Texas --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is this a kind of a park? What do we regard this space as? What is it? Is it a park-like setting?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is a park-like setting. It is the acres of the State Capitol grounds. Every monument on the State Capitol grounds is there because the State legislature wanted to convey a particular message. It is a felony in Texas, an impeachable offense to put anything on the Capitol grounds without the approval of the legislature. Most of the monuments are there to honor war veterans. This is the only religious message anywhere on the Capitol grounds. And by itself --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, would it be all right, in your view, if they put several others up for different religions? Then is it going to be okay?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the clear purpose and message was to honor the diversity of religions in Texas, it would then be permissible. If it were a series of displays like that frieze, the fifteen different --

03-1500 +++$+++ 4647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Quite the contrary, I think it's a --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or the depiction on the door of the Court?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Quite the contrary. This is exactly how the State may display the Ten Commandments.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the prayers in Congress don't do that and our Thanksgiving proclamations don't do that. They invoke a God, a unitary God, and that's contrary to the dictates of some religions that believe that there are a lot of gods.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, there is --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't pray to gods, the prayers are always to God. You know, I don't see why the one is good and the other is bad. It's no answer to say, well, you know, the former has been around for a long time. Well, it has but it suggests what the framers and what our society for several hundred years has believed the Establishment Clause means. And it does not -- it is not too sectarian if it invokes a unitary God. Now, you're saying it becomes too sectarian when it invokes the Ten Commandments.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. I'm saying several things. As I said earlier, first, this Court in Chambers v. Marsh said that there was a unique history to legislative prayers. There isn't a similar history here.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, too, doesn't the venue count? After all, we have had the question of prayer in schools, and the Court has said that that was not all right. Prayer in the legislature was distinguished. So it's not just prayer anywhere that the government wants to have it is okay.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, Justice Ginsburg, the venue counts. And here the venue is very important. It is the corner between the Texas State Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court. And in that way, this monument standing alone does convey the government's endorsement for religion.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. But if the legislature itself can have its sessions opened with a prayer, can the legislature itself want to have the Ten Commandments posted within the legislative halls?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I think there is a very different message that's conveyed.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can it do that?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, it can't post the Ten Commandments by itself in its legislative halls because that would then be the government endorsing expression for support for that message. It cannot be, Your Honor, that just because there is a legislative prayer, that any religious message anywhere on government property would then be permissible. As Justice Kennedy has said in his opinion for --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's so hard to draw that line. If the legislature can open its own sessions attended by the public with a prayer, you say it cannot, in the same building, display the Ten Commandments.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right, because the message from the government is quite different. The message with legislative prayers, as this Court found in Chambers v. Marsh, is a recognition of a long historical practice. But when it comes to the Ten Commandments, it really is different than even a legislative prayer. This declares not only there is a God, but that God has proclaimed rules for behavior. The Ten Commandments come from sacred texts. As Justice Kennedy said in his opinion of County of Allegheny, certainly a city council could not put atop the city hall building a large Latin cross, even if that city council begins every day with a prayer. It cannot be there just because some religious messages are allowed, like a prayer, that everything then becomes permissible.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you know, in the First Amendment speech area, we're very, very strict. A moment's delay in publication is a constitutional crisis. And I'm not sure that we should carry that over to this area, where there is this obsessive concern with any mention of religion. That seems to me to show a hostility to religion. I just don't see a balanced dialogue in our cases or in these kinds of arguments.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't believe there should be an obsessive concern with religion. If the Ten Commandments are displayed as part of an overall display of law givers, like that frieze, it's permissible. But when you put sacred texts somewhere on government property, then the message is that the government is endorsing --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This is a classic avert your eyes. If an atheist walked by, he can avert his eyes, he can think about something else.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think so, Your Honor. This Court has said the key is that the government can't endorse religion, in a way that makes some feel like insiders and some like outsiders. Imagine somebody who is Muslim or Buddhist or Hindu --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask you this question. Supposing -- I recently read a case from the Seventh Circuit on what they did in Lacrosse, Wisconsin. And as we all know, this organization has donated Ten Commandments monuments all over the country. And what they did there is they sold the parcel back to the Eagles, their name, and put up a sign which read, this property is not owned or maintained by the City of Lacrosse, nor does the city endorse the religious expression thereon. Now, my question to you is, if there were a similar disclaimer on this monument, would that be an adequate remedy, in your view?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would be a harder case, but I don't think it would be an adequate remedy. And the reason is the city cannot put a religious symbol standing alone on government property just through disclaimer. That's exactly what County of Allegheny was. There the nativity scene in the courthouse had a plaque saying it was donated by others, but that can't excuse it because otherwise the city could put the large Latin cross just with a disclaimer.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if the test is whether the reasonable observer would think that the government is endorsing the religious message, wouldn't the disclaimer make it clear to the reasonable observer the government was not endorsing the message?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think the disclaimer would make it a harder case, but I think when you're dealing with the ground in a Texas State Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court, that placement, when you're dealing with the Ten Commandments, sacred texts, I still think that the message the reasonable observer would be that this is the government endorsing religion.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At some point, would the State's interest in preserving old objects overcome the objection constitutionally?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, at some point, it could where it was clear to the reasonable observer that it was there because it was an old object.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How did this monument get there? Was it in -- is it true that it was put in as a result of promoting a movie about the Ten Commandments?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The record is unclear as to that. There are certainly many indications in the popular press that Cecil B. DeMille together with his movie, The Ten Commandments, worked with the Friends of Eagles to have these monuments put around the country. But there is nothing in the legislative history that links this particular monument to that.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't the display on the tablets on the top before you get to the text, before you get to, I am the Lord, thy God. I thought that those were replicas of what was in the film.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know that, Your Honor. I've tried to find out what that text is. It is not in Hebrew. It is not in a script that anyone was able to recognize. But it is important to notice that if you look at the entire monument, in addition to the Ten Commandments, there is also a Latin symbol of Christ, there is also Jewish Stars of David. And as I was saying in response to Justice Kennedy's question, imagine the Muslim or the Buddhist who walks into the State Supreme Court to have his or her case heard. That person will see this monument and realize it's not his or her government.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought Muslims accept the Ten Commandments.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, the Muslims do not accept the sacred nature of the Ten Commandments, nor do Hindus, or those who believe in many gods, nor of course, do atheists. And for that matter, Your Honor, if a Jewish individual would walk by this Ten Commandments, and see that the first commandment isn't the Jewish version, I am the Lord, thy God, took you out of Egypt, out of slavery, would realize it's not his or her government either.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You know, I think probably 90 percent of the American people believe in the Ten Commandments, and I'll bet you that 85 percent of them couldn't tell you what the ten are. (Laughter.)
03-1500 +++$+++ 4679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And when somebody goes by that monument, I don't think they're studying each one of the commandments. It's a symbol of the fact that government comes -- derives its authority from God. And that is, it seems to me, an appropriate symbol to be on State grounds.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I disagree, Your Honor. For the State to put that symbol between its State Capitol and the State Supreme Court is to convey a profound religious message. If you're just saying, now, this isn't there for its secular reason. If someone were to read this monument, one sees that it emphasizes its religious content.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is a profound religious message, but it's a profound religious message believed in by the vast majority of the American people, just as belief in monotheism is shared by a vast majority of the American people. And our traditions show that there is nothing wrong with the government reflecting that. I mean, we're a tolerant society religiously, but just as the majority has to be tolerant of minority views in matters of religion, it seems to me the minority has to be tolerant of the majority's ability to express its belief that government comes from God, which is what this is about. As Justice Kennedy said, turn your eyes away if it's such a big deal to you.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I disagree, Your Honor. Because this Court has said that above all, the government can't make some feel like they're insiders and some like outsiders. Even if they're the majority religion --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, suppose a non-Christian, say a Muslim, comes before a judge who has very strong Christian beliefs, a very religious person. Does he feel like an outsider? And to require that we pretend that there is no religious motivation, no deep religious conviction on the part of many of our public officials seems to me to be a hostility toward religion.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. Imagine that judge put the Ten Commandments right above his or her bench. That would make some individuals feel like outsiders. Of course, many judges have religious beliefs, but they can't have the religious beliefs above them. And Your Honor, that's not hostility to religion. As this Court said in County of Allegheny, excluding religious symbols like the nativity scene, when displayed by itself, is not hostility to religion. Last year in Locke v. Davie, this Court said that to deny funding through the State of Washington for scholarships was not hostility to religion. Enforcing the Establishment Clause is not about hostility to religion. It is about making sure that every person who walks into that courtroom can feel that it's his or her government.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's an important point to me, but I don't see any way to get there in these difficult cases without making a practical judgment about whether that's really so. And the reason I say that, I start with Goldberg's opinion with Harlan in Schempp. And I know there are a lot of others, but I don't know if we've found a satisfactory test. And the point that they make is the government should be noninvolved with the religious, and it can't favor one over the other. But at the same time, we are a religious nation, where most people do believe in God and most of our institutions flow from the religious nature of our people. The City on the Hill, proclaim liberty throughout the land. All of those are religious. So how can the government, without what they call the pervasive and brooding commitment to secularism, which they think would be wrong, become necessarily involved because of our traditions, but not go too far? Now, I come to the conclusion very tentatively, there is no way to do it other than look at the divisive quality of the individual display case by case. And when I do that, I don't find much divisiveness here. Now, I'm exposing the whole thing not because I'm accepting it, but I would love to hear what you think.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, I think that the test that this Court has formulated do draw those lines. With regard to your point about divisiveness, the Ten Commandments is enormously divisive right now. I don't think we can ignore the social reality. The chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court resigned, there are crowds outside today. I got hate messages this week, not because people care about the Ten Commandments as a secular document, but people care about the Ten Commandments because it's a profound religious message. And many want that religious message on government property. And I'm saying the government can put the Ten Commandments there as part of an overall display of law givers, because, Justice O'Connor, it's an overall display about diversity of religion. But when the Ten Commandments sits by itself it is, to use your word right now, enormously divisive. And that's why, from that criteria, it does violate the Establishment Clause.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What about the opening of this Court's session today, in a manner that has been used since John Marshall, is that divisive because there are a lot of people who don't believe in God.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But You Honor, I think that you have to distinguish between minimal religious content and maximum religious content.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chemerinsky, on that point, how much of the Ten Commandments -- I mean, once we get to thou shalt not kill or murder, then there are tenets to govern a society, but how much are strictly about the obligation that man owes to God?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The first of the two tablets, the first five commandments, Your Honor, and of course religions belief this was written in God's own hand and given to Moses. It's believed that the first five commandments that you were referring to are God's prescriptions for religious behavior. The latter five, the others that you're referring to, were God's commands for secular behavior. All of these are God's commands to God's people. And that's what makes it different than the minimal religious content of God save this Honorable Court that Justice Scalia was referring to. The core of Texas's argument seems to be that it's there for secular purposes. But of course, if one looks at this monument, one sees that it's emphasizing the religious content and there is nothing that would lend the reasonable observer to see the secular content. It says in large letters, I am the Lord, thy God.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, suppose, Mr. Chemerinsky, it was like Moses on that frieze where there are commandments showing, but there are only the sixth through tenth commandment. Would that be all right?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, if it was like Moses on that frieze together with fourteen other symbols, absolutely okay, because it would clear to the reasonable observer --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if we just had the Moses with the tablet that has the instructions for how people will conduct themselves in a civilized society versus worshiping the Lord.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that would still be unconstitutional between the Texas State Capitol and the Texas Supreme Court because it would still be the State of Texas expressing the message that there is a God and that God has dictated these rules for behavior.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, what if you go one step further and there was simply a tablet without any embellishment about source saying, you know, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet, et cetera, basically just the last five commandments, pure and simple. Would you have any objection on Establishment Clause grounds?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the tablets were by themselves in that way, between the Texas Supreme Court and the Texas State Capitol, it would be a harder case, but I believe it would still be unconstitutional because those tablets do convey a message that God --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I'm just talking about when I -- I don't know if I used the word tablet. I'm just talking about a piece of stone or a 10 poster that says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not 11 covet, thou shalt not bear false witness, et cetera. Would there be any Establishment Clause 13 objection simply because though it does not say so, those 14 were quotations from the last six commandments - last five commandments.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. If all 16 it said was thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not 17 steal, I don't think that that would be a problem 18 because, of course, those are a reflection of law.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Who are you kidding? I 20 mean, everybody knows that comes from the Ten 21 Commandments. And what that message says is that 22 these commands that are engraved on the human heart 23 come from God. Why put it that way? You know, 24 instead of that, just quote the State statute against 25 murder. That's not what they're doing. They're saying these basic principles of human behavior that we're governed by come from God. And that message would be conveyed so long as you use the terminology of the Ten Commandments. That's what the Ten Commandments stand for.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Your Honor, this Court has emphasized that content and context matter enormously. And what I'm trying to do is to distinguish the situation where in Texas, it was clearly tablets with the words, I am the Lord, thy God, with five commandments for religious behavior and five for secular behavior. From Justice Souter's question, there are five others and especially those that are reflected in State law, like thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not steal. I think that the message is different there. It is the words, I am the Lord, thy God.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think you're telling us that the State cannot accommodate religion. The only way they can do it is to put the Ten Commandments up and insist that it's always secular, whether it's predominantly for a secular purpose. It seems to me that's hypocritical and it's asking religious people to surrender their beliefs and that is not accommodation.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. I do think that it degrades religion to have to have the Ten Commandments defended for their secular purpose. I do think, though, that what's required of the government, when it puts religious symbols on government property, is to not be endorsing religion. That's why a nativity scene by itself in the County of Allegheny case was unconstitutional. On the other hand, that's why the nativity scene as part of a unified display in Lynch v. Donnelly was permissible. That's why, if the Ten Commandments are part of an overall display like this frieze, it's permissible. If it's part of an overall display about religious tolerance, and that's what the reasonable observer would see, it is permissible. But where it is the Ten Commandments themselves, placed as they are here, then it really is about the government endorsing religion, then it is the purpose of advancing religion and then it does violate the Establishment Clause.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So the word accommodate should not be within our jurisprudence?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Accommodate should very much be in the jurisprudence. And any time there is a Free Exercise Clause claim, then there has to be careful attention to accommodating religion. But there is no Free Exercise Clause claim in this case, Your Honor, so this isn't a case about accommodating anybody's religious beliefs. This is about the State expressing support for religion with sacred and solemn religious texts on government property. And my position is --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can the State express its support for religion generally?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, it would all depend
03-1500 +++$+++ 4707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose it didn't have the Ten Commandments, it just had a big thing that says religion is good. It said religion is the foundation of our institutions. Suppose there were something like that. Would that be bad?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think that would be a problem under the Establishment Clause because it's minimal --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there are atheists who disagree with that intensely.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Your Honor, I'm not arguing for a heckler's veto by atheists. What I am saying is that when the government puts sacred and solemn texts taken directly from the Bible at the core of its State government, it has to then do something to convey the message that it's not there for religious purposes, that it's there for secular purposes.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Doesn't it matter whether that text has acquired an independent meaning of its own? As I say, I don't think most people know what the text of the Ten Commandments are, but they do know that it stands for the fact that our laws are derived from God. That's what it stands for. Why isn't that symbolism sufficient to enable the State of Texas to use it?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Ten Commandments monument by itself conveys the message that the Ten Commandments are the source of law and it's that message the State can't convey. May I save the rest of the time for rebuttal?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, you may save your time.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CHEMERINSKY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ General Abbott, we'll hear for you, please.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4717 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Every court that has reviewed the specific facts of this case has agreed that the Texas monument is constitutional under this Court's well settled precedents in Lynch and Allegheny. This Court should agree that the Texas monument should not be torn down from its historical place for three reasons. First, the Ten Commandments is an historically recognized symbol of law. Second, this monument is one of the smallest of the 17 monuments on the Capitol grounds, and like most of the other monuments, was a gift to the State of Texas and is clearly recognized as such on the monument itself. And third, this monument has stood for more than 40 years without controversy on a national historic landmark. In fact, even the --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you this question? Under your analysis of the reason this is justifiable, would it equally be permissible to have a crucifix of the same size in the same location on the Capitol grounds?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4719 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, I think that would pose a much greater problem.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4720 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not my question. Do you think it would be permissible -- it seems to me your reasoning that you've given us would support that result. And maybe that's the correct result. I'm wondering what your view is.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4721 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I seriously question whether or not a crucifix would be constitutionally acceptable in that same location, and for the very same reasons which I'm articulating why the Ten Commandments would be acceptable in this location. The crucifix is not like the Ten Commandments in that it's not an historically recognized symbol of law. It doesn't send a secular message to all the people, regardless of whether or not they are believers or not believers of the important role the Ten Commandments have played in the development of law.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not a secular message. I mean, if you're watering it down to say that the only reason it's okay is it sends nothing but a secular message, I can't agree with you. I think the message it sends is that law is -- and our institutions come from God. And if you don't think it conveys that message, I just think you're kidding yourself.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, the Ten Commandments send both a religious message and a secular message. When people --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the district court, I think in this very case, found that commemorating the Ten Commandments' role in the development of secular law was not one of the State's purposes in accepting the monument. Now, will you accept that finding as the case comes to us? That hasn't been challenged. We don't have any cross appeal. I assume we accept that finding of the district court.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The Court obviously is correct to accept that finding. As you know, from the district court's finding, the secular purpose that was accepted by the district court was to honor the Fraternal Order of Eagles. But also there was an ongoing --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you're arguing for something contrary to the district court's finding.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm actually, Justice O'Connor, arguing for purposes that are in addition to that district court's finding because there was an ongoing purpose to retain this now historical monument that has stood for more than 40 years without controversy on a national and historic landmark.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So in another case, if a government official feels that the Ten Commandments have been very, very important in his or her life as a spiritual or religious matter and wants other people to know how important the Ten Commandments are, he cannot accept on behalf of the city the Ten Commandments. And so you can have no Ten Commandments in city A, but the Ten Commandments in city B. General, that doesn't make a lot of sense to me. And again, you're just doing with purpose what you did in response to Justice Scalia's question. You're asking us to ignore the religious purpose that is the most manifest value of these symbols.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, with regard to both purpose and effect in this particular setting, I don't think that religion was the driving force. I know that all of the evidence shows that religion was not a driving force in any respect.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4730 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I suppose that every monument that's on the State Capitol grounds in Texas in a sense conveys a message of State endorsement, State endorsement of the role of servicemen in fighting earlier wars or in support of the Boy Scouts or whatever it might be, doesn't it? I mean, by placing them there with the legislative approval, is that not really some kind of a message of endorsement for each one?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4731 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I may clarify an important fact and that is clearly the State of Texas, by displaying 17 monuments in a museum-like setting on the Capitol grounds, is trying to acknowledge and commemorate certain events. It's important for the Court to remember, though, that the State of Texas has specifically endorsed nine of those monuments by putting the State seal or the Lone Star seal for the State of Texas on those nine monuments. This monument does not have that kind of endorsement on there.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4732 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't it all the case, as has been pointed out, that no monument is going to be on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol without the approval of the legislature? You don't dispute that, do you?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4733 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not at all. That is very true.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you don't dispute that anyone going on those grounds would assume that the State government approved it or it wouldn't be there?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, of course the presumption would be that people on the Capitol grounds would assume the State of Texas wanted those monuments on the Capitol grounds.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm not sure that that endorsement -- in England, there is a square where they have King Charles on one hand -- on one end and he's looking at Oliver Cromwell, who beheaded him, on the other. I don't know if you have to endorse one or the other.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Kennedy, I believe that there is a very meaningful difference between this Court's standards of an endorsement and what a State or the nation may do with regard to commemoration. As an easy example, on the National Mall, there is, of course, the Lincoln Memorial and in the Lincoln Memorial, there is text from the King James version of the Bible. The nation commemorates and acknowledges Lincoln and what he has said. But by that display, the United States is not trying to endorse the King James version of the Bible or a particular religious message in that. Instead what the state
03-1500 +++$+++ 4738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you have to contend with the fact that the district court found that this sort of commemoration of the Commandments involved was not the objective in placing the monument there, so you're left basically with a religious text. And if anybody has any doubt about that, the religious text is surrounded by some religious symbols, the Chi Rho, the Star of David. So it seems to me that it's hard to find, if we accept the district court findings, that there's anything here but an expression of approval by the State of Texas for a religious expression, and only for the religious expression.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sir, all other factors, though, Justice Souter, as a person who stands in front of that monument clearly recognizes, centered in a specialized scroll is an indication that this was a monument that was dedicated and presented to the people and the youth of the State of Texas by the Fraternal Order of Eagles. There is no stamp of approval on this by the State of Texas on that monument.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you're not trying to withdraw the -- I took it to be the concession that of course anyone would reasonably assume that the State of Texas approved this message, and thought it was appropriate to devote state property to its promulgation.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Clearly the State of Texas approved of the monument being on the grounds --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But then the fact that the Eagles also approve it doesn't really get us very far, does it?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, where I believe it gets you, as this Court has recognized, there is a very meaningful difference between acknowledging something and endorsing something. For example, the creche in Lynch or the menorah in Allegheny.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me ask you this. If the Eagles' presentation statement weren't on there, would that make a difference to Establishment Clause analysis?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that the Eagles' disclaimer on there helps our case, but if it were not on there, I think the monument could still stand just as the creche did in Lynch or the menorah in Allegheny. The city of Pawtucket was not endorsing the creche in the display, it was acknowledged as part of the overall holiday celebration.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what do you do with the district court finding?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the district court finding obviously chose to decide that the secular purpose for the display was to honor the Fraternal Order of Eagles for their commitment to combating juvenile delinquency. But that is different -- the purpose why the district court found why the display was constitutional is different than the message that is being sent to the reasonable observer.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You had a second point and I don't want to miss your second point.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The second point is that there are other displays in this Court. As a person walks into this courtroom or exits the courtroom, they don't see the Ten Commandments in a display with a bunch of law givers. Instead, they see the Ten Commandments alone with an eagle above it.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They see blank tablets. They don't see any writing. This is the only one that has script on it. It has numbers and in fact that's confusing because one of them, the people think is the Ten Commandments is the Bill of Rights. (Laughter.)
03-1500 +++$+++ 4755 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, clearly the Ten Commandments that are reflected on the doorway into and out of this courtroom don't have words on them like the tablets do in the State of Texas.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4756 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But we know what they are, don't we?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do and that's the point. Even more importantly, the reasonable observer knows what --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But do we know which version of the Ten Commandments it stands for? There are three different versions at least.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I happen to agree with the Petitioner. There is more than three versions of the Ten Commandments. And the purpose, if you go back to what the Eagles were trying to achieve here, was to come up with a version of the Ten Commandments that wasn't reflective of any particular religion.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it doesn't matter what the version is, does it? If it just stands for the fact that laws -- the foundation of our laws is God. If that's all it stands for, who cares what the text is.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ General Abbott, would the Texas purpose be equally served if the monument had on it the kind of disclaimer that the city in Wisconsin put on its monument?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, I apologize, I'm not familiar with that disclaimer.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It reads this way. What they did is they sold the parcel of land that had the Eagles' donation on it back to the Eagles and then they put a fence around it and then they put this sign up, "This property is not owned or maintained by the City of Lacrosse, nor does the City endorse the religious expression thereon." Maybe as long as it's still on the property, it couldn't be the same. But suppose you had a comparable disclaimer. Would that defeat any of the purposes on which you relied to justify having the statue there?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ A disclaimer like that would surely ensure that this display is constitutional. However, it's our contention --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And would it undermine the message that you legitimately seek to convey?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't believe it would.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, why don't you do it and we wouldn't have this case? I really would consider it something of a Pyrrhic victory if you win on the ground that you're arguing. So that in all future cases, we're going to have to examine displays of the Ten Commandments to see whether there was ever any intent to say that our laws are ultimately dependent upon God. Is that what you want us to do case by case?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, this Court obviously has decided Establishment Clause cases on a case-by-case basis, but in this particular instance, the Ten Commandments displayed in a museum-like setting on the Capitol grounds arrayed among 17 other monuments, the message that is received by the viewer who is trekking through the Capitol grounds looking at monuments is clearly one not of the State of Texas.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I've got to get one question before you leave because you're the one who knows the record. And what I've had a hard time finding in the record is what I think there must be some material that the State or somebody in a tourist office or a guide or somebody tells people what the 17 different monuments are. And all I've found is the general brochure which doesn't tell them what they are. And I found something on the Internet. Well, which is in the record. But aside from this page from the Internet in the record and that, is there anything else in this record that if somebody wanders around, they're on the State grounds, they say, what is this, what are these things anyway? There must be something that tells them. And where is it?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The state provides a walking tour guide.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the brochure doesn't tell what they are. This thing, it says grounds?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, Justice Breyer, if I could refer you to page 205 of the Joint Appendix, it provides a description of each of the monuments on the walking tour. And if I could also refer the Court to page 117 of the Joint Appendix, it shows the actual walking tour where a person would go along the process of seeing the monuments. But clearly as they walk through the Capitol grounds, what any observer, not just the reasonable observer, what any observer would notice is that before they could even get to this particular monument, they will have passed in full view of countless other monuments and historical markers clearly indicating to them that they are not there for the purpose of seeing just the Ten Commandments but they are in a museum-like setting cast among many different kinds of monuments. And so they appreciate the setting before they even arrive at the Ten Commandments monument. Also when they arrive at the Ten Commandments monument, they will notice it is one of the smallest of the monuments on the Texas Capitol grounds. It does have the disclaimer on it indicating that it was donated by the Fraternal Order of Eagles. It does not have the State seal on it like many of the other monuments, so it's not --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it like how many other monuments? This is not peculiar to Texas. The Order of the Eagles have given how many monuments just like this one, identical to this one?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, it is actually not clear from the record. There have been some accounts of hundreds, maybe even into the thousands that the Fraternal Order of Eagles have given out. And I cannot tell you for a fact that they are all identical.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ When you said that every court that has considered this case has said it's compatible with the Establishment Clause, did you mean just this Texas case or other cases involving an Eagles Ten Commandments?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, my reference was to the fact that every case that has considered the specific -- every court that has considered the specific facts of this case, meaning the Texas case --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you didn't mean this particular depiction of the Ten Commandments?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. What I meant is that both the district court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals specifically reviewed the facts of this case and were all in complete agreement that the facts of this case render this monument constitutional under this Court's well settled precedents in Lynch and Allegheny. One other thing I would like to draw the Court's attention to that will give you a very well understanding of what the monument looks like and its setting is the videotape that is Exhibit 44, it's obviously not part of the Joint Appendix, but it demonstrates how this particular monument is set in a museum-like setting amongst many other monuments and gives you the perspective of what the typical viewer would appreciate as they walk around the Capitol grounds.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Kind of an eclectic museum. One message that you get is that the State is honoring the donor of the various --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ General Abbott, I want to thank you for your argument and also for demonstrating that it's not necessary to stand at the lectern in order to a fine job. Thank you.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GEN. ABBOTT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Your Honor.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Clement.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4784 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The Ten Commandments have undeniable religious significance, but they also have secular significance as a code of law and as a well-recognized historical symbol of the law. When a State decides to display a Ten Commandments display along with more than a dozen other monuments on its Capitol grounds in order to honor the donor, it is not endorsing the religious text of the Ten Commandments. And in the same way, when a state has that monument as part of such a collection, the Establishment Clause should not be interpreted to force them to send a message of hostility to religion by singling out that one monument for removal solely because of its religious content.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Clement, can I ask you to address one thing that troubles me about the case? As I understand it, it's the Protestant version basically of the Ten Commandments we have before us, which has significant differences from the Catholic version and the Jewish version. And I understand it was the result of consultation and so forth. But I noticed in your brief, you list the States in which the Ten Commandments displays are listed, there is none for Rhode Island, which I often think of as primarily a Catholic state, and the only one from Massachusetts is a frieze on the north wall of the public library which apparently didn't have the text of the commandments in it. Is there any significance to the fact that this kind of display may be more popular in areas of the country where the Protestant religion is dominant as opposed to other versions of Christian religions?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, I don't think so. I mean, we didn't purport to do an exhaustive survey, but I think there is a well-represented group of displays throughout the country including, I think, in States that probably have relatively high Catholic populations. But I think we would steer this Court away from attributing too much significance to the fact that if a State is going to display the Ten Commandments at all, it will necessarily have to display a version that reflects one or another sect's preferences. I mean, in the Marsh case, for example, this Court upheld legislative prayer. It understood that they would necessarily have to choose a chaplain and that chaplain would necessarily be of one denomination or another. And this Court didn't doom the whole practice of legislative prayer because of the necessity of picking a chaplain of one denomination or another. In fact, in the Marsh case itself, this court upheld Nebraska's practice, even though they had chosen the same Presbyterian minister for 16 straight years. And so I don't think this Court in other Establishment Clause contexts has steered away from putting the States and municipalities in a catch-22. And given that this Court has suggested even in Stone against Graham that the Ten Commandments can be displayed, can be used in certain settings, it can't be that once the State in practice picks a particular version, it's all of a sudden guilty of a sectarian preference.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course, the other thing that was notable about your listing is most of the examples are examples of displays of the event itself rather than the text. And there is an argument made I think by Professor Laycock that when you display the entire text, it's kind of a different sort of symbol than when you just have a symbolic presentation.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Stevens, I think there are quite a few of both types of displays and I think the very fact that the Fraternal Order of Eagles put a lot of these displays out suggests that a bunch of them are textual displays. I'm not sure, though, that a display that actually has Moses receiving the Ten Commandments from God is any less religious. I would suggest that's actually more religious than one that just displays the monument standing alone. If the monuments are standing alone, you can I think appreciate the fact that maybe they're being displayed for their secular significance as well as their religious significance. When Moses is there, it's hard to avoid the implication that they are the revealed law of God, as opposed to also a secular code. So in that sense, I'm not sure that the variations in the display --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You think just a symbolic display is less objectionable than quoting the text as this monument does?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Stevens, I would say -- my point is not that there are not other ways to display it. I mean, certainly I think, as we point out in our brief, blank tablets or tablets with Roman numerals are less objectionable -- certainly, I don't think they're beyond objection -- than a textual display. My point was that I'm not quite sure how one would balance sort of four Commandments and Moses versus all Ten Commandments in text. I think it's a close call.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, except the four Commandments and Moses would avoid the differences between the three different versions of the Ten Commandments, whereas when you quote one, you must select one over the other two.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I guess I'm not sure that's true. I mean, some of the displays that are out there in courthouses have Moses receiving the Commandments and have text. And I guess, my point, though, would be, again --
03-1500 +++$+++ 4793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Most of them don't.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To be sure, to be sure. But I would hope the constitutional line wouldn't be that you can't have text. I mean, the Ten Commandments have a role in our society and had an influence on the development of the law as text. I mean, you know, they weren't influential with ten Roman numbers. They were influential as text.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ General Clement, there is a question I have about the government's position. And does place matter at all? I mean, here we're talking about the grounds surrounding a State Capitol. What about every school room, if that's the choice of the school board? Is it the same or do you make -- or every courtroom up to the court to decide for itself?
03-1500 +++$+++ 4796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, I certainly think location and context matters. I think in almost every Establishment Clause context, the setting and context matters a great deal. The school case, for example, as you suggest, I mean, unless this Court is going to revisit Stone against Graham, it's certainly true that the school context at least raises much more difficult questions. In terms of where it can be displayed in a courthouse, I think there are certainly permissible displays in the courthouse, but it may be something all together different to have a display in a way that it actually looks like a religious sanctuary within the walls of the courthouse.
03-1500 +++$+++ 4808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chemerinsky. The case is submitted.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4812 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We will now hear argument in Orff against the United States. Mr. Smiland.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4814 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The relevant language of the 1963 contract, as illuminated in the surrounding circumstances, was confirmed in the express terms of the 1986 stipulated judgment which commanded the district and the United States to perform the contract. In particular, the first sentence of paragraph 4.2, which is at joint appendix page 111, states -- and I quote -- the district acknowledges that it entered into the 1963 contract for the benefit of Areas 1A and 1B. That's the premerger --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Smiland, do you mind telling us why the petitioners never filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. There's a long history of litigation here. It began with the first suit in 1979. We were in the district court there. There were administrative and constitutional and equitable issues as well, and we were able in that initial case to combine all those forms of relief in the district court. And then, of course, we got this judgment that I began to read from. And from then on, we had four or five other cases all in the district court. We do acknowledge that on the breach of contract, there is concurrent jurisdiction under the Tucker Act.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it concurrent? I mean, the -- the statute I'm reading, the one you brought is consent is given to join the United States as a necessary party defendant. Is that what happened here? They were joined as a necessary party defendant?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we think so, Your Honor.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They were? I -- I think that's -- isn't that -- what rule of -- I thought there's a -- a Rule of Federal Procedure. I can't remember what -- what's the --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4820 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Rule 19(s)?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4821 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Is that what they were joined under?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that procedure was not invoked here.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. Well, all right. Were they -- there's technical phrase well known in the law to be joined as a necessary party defendant. Given the normal meaning in the law of that technical phrase, is that what happened here?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. What happened -- what happened --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, okay. If it did not happen, then how could you possibly sue in that court rather than the Court of Claims where the statute says you can sue on any implied, as well as express, contract?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4826 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because the waiver of sovereign immunity statute says in any suit.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't mean in any suit in sentence 2 of the kind referred to in sentence 1? Does it mean any suit in the universe? Any suit in the world? Any tort suit? I would have thought that sentence 2 refers to sentence 1.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- it does and that case was litigated against the United States by my clients and -- and we won in the Peck case. And we think that should have ended the matter.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But don't -- how can we, if we have -- if -- if I read this -- this as meaning technically what it says and it's a jurisdictional matter, how could I do anything other than say, go to the Court of Claims, you're in the wrong court?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Any suit is also in the first sentence, Your Honor.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. It says --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in any suit you can join the United States as a necessary party.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the -- in the sue and be sued cases, this Court construes that very broadly, and this is the same root word and --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but we don't give broad construction to waivers of sovereign immunity.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Quite the reverse. And it says to join the U.S. as a necessary party defendant in a suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights of a contracting entity in the United States regarding any contract executed pursuant. Now, I guess the farmers were not technically the contracting entity.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They were not the signing --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- party.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you've got more problems.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our -- our argument -- and again, this has been resolved in the lower courts against the Government. But our -- our view is that by the nature of the intended beneficiary doctrine, the duty is owed to the third party, as well as to the promisee, and it's enforceable by the third party, as well as the promisee.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4843 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you -- if the lower courts were of this view, why did the district court in this case give you three opportunities to have your contract claim transferred to the Claims Court?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4844 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Once the determination was made that we were not intended third party beneficiaries, that was the law of the case, and had it been transferred to the Claims Court, we -- we would have been bound by that determination. We felt we had to bring to a final resolution the -- the intended beneficiary issue before we could proceed in the Claims Court either.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4845 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it does suggest that the district court had at least some concern whether the case -- your claim had been lodged in the right court.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4846 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, although again that -- that court had been hearing these matters for many years in -- in numerous cases without this issue ever having come up.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4847 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but it's a -- see, I want to know what I'm supposed to do. As I read the language, you're out. As I understand the purpose of the statute, it makes sense to me if you're out, and it doesn't make sense to me if you're in. And maybe there's some lower court precedent to the contrary, which I'd certainly read, but is there any Supreme Court precedent to the contrary that supports you?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4848 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Just the -- the language of in any suit definitely is --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4849 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. But that isn't the limiting part. The limiting part is in any suit of a certain kind.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4850 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4851 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What they give consent to is joinder as a necessary party. And that is not what happened here.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4852 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Only the -- the general principle that language should be read in its ordinary meaning --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4853 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's ordinary meaning, you're out because the ordinary meaning of joinder as a necessary party is you weren't joined as a --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4854 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There -- there at least is no evidence that Congress had rule 19 in mind when it enacted either the '52 statute or the '82 statute that we -- we stand on.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4855 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's something that I hadn't concentrated on before now, but your position that, well, if you're transferred to the Court -- to the Court of Claims, that you bring with you all of the previous rulings of the United States district court in California and that those are somehow binding because of the law of the case -- what is the authority for that? The -- the court that's transferred has to accept all the rulings that have been made previous to the transfer?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4856 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- our understanding is if, obviously --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4857 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, what's the authority for that?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4858 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I can't cite you authority, Your Honor, but I -- we were very concerned about that. If there was no waiver of sovereign immunity in the first instance, then the lower court's ruling on intended third party beneficiary I would think should be vacated.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4859 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could I -- I -- I guess I'm not following this. I don't know why, Mr. Smiland, you -- you have not referred to the last sentence of -- of what you assert was the waiver of sovereign immunity, which says any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States district court in the State in which the land involved is situated. Why isn't that what you're relying on?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4860 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is and -- and when I was talking about in any suit --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4861 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How does that help you? Because it says any suit pursuant to this section, and of course, this section starts off by talking about addition of a person as a necessary party. So how does the last sentence help you?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4862 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4863 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- it -- if the words, join necessary, limit any suit and the language that Justice Scalia referred to, then -- then maybe we're in trouble. But otherwise --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4864 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I take that to mean that when you sue one defendant and you also sue the United States as a necessary party defendant, that suit -- any -- that would be a suit pursuant to this section. I -- I don't know what other meaning that -- that sentence could have. When you sue two parties, one of whom is the United States, by reason of the fact that it's a necessary party defendant, that suit is a suit pursuant this section and it can be brought in any United States district court in the State in which the land involved is situated. I -- I don't know what -- what other suit that -- that sentence could refer to.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4865 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You -- you agree with that. I -- you're caught in between us here, and I understand. (Laughter.)
03-1566 +++$+++ 4866 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I guess we have to figure out what is the right meaning of that initial phrase.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4867 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Perhaps you can explain. This was not your suit originally. You intervened. Right? This was started out by the water district.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4868 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The district sued the United States. We intervened.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4869 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And then after some, I think, 2 years --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4870 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4871 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the water district bows out. It has settled its case. It's a mystery what it settled for. At least, I didn't see it in any of the briefs. Why did the water district, having brought this case, then say, we're satisfied, we're out?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4872 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The record is very sparse, Your Honor. There is the district's motion which says pretty much what it said in its brief, that there was a -- a thing called the principles between it and the United States and various parties. And as a result of those principles, which are not in the record, although they are a matter of public record, the -- the district in its discretion elected to dismiss the case. We opposed that. We would have hoped the district would have kept going. We lost that opposition. The district was dismissed, and we were allowed to proceed on our own.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4873 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Smiland, can I ask this question? If Justice Breyer is -- the thrust of his question is right, I -- I think the district itself could not have brought the suit under his reading of the sovereign immunity. And I'm just wondering, has the United States ever taken the position that the district could not have initiated this litigation?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4874 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not to my knowledge, Your Honor.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4875 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could -- could we hear your argument on -- on the sovereign immunity point as opposed to the venue point? What -- on what ground do you say the United States has waived its -- its immunity from suit in this case?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4876 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There are two statutes.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4877 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May -- may we just back up to the question -- your answer to Justice Stevens? I thought that this wasn't a suit initially on the part of the water district for money damages. I thought they were seeking declaratory relief against the United States.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4878 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They pled both, Your Honor. Although at that time the water still was available for delivery, it hadn't flowed to the ocean. And the money had not yet been collected and spent. So the focus initially was on equitable relief to stop --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4879 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because one could -- one could read the words, suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights, as a suit for declaratory relief but not encompassing damages.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4880 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Both statutes we cite say that judgments can be entered in the same manner, to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, language I believe from the Federal Tort Claims Act. Again, both in the 491 F.Supp. decision under the McCarran Act and in the Peck case, the district court held that money damages were encompassed by that. So both statute -- statutes on which we rely have language in it taken from other sources of law, with which this Court is very familiar and has opined on several times. The -- the only unique parts of -- of either of the two statutes that we stand on are -- are the rights. One refers to administering a previously adjudicated right to the use of water, and the other is the contract language we've discussed.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4881 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can you turn to sovereign immunity now?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4882 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4883 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and let me make -- make it easy for you. Do you know of any case, other than cases decided by this friendly district judge, in which a suit has been allowed against the United States based on nothing more than the status as a third party beneficiary of a contract to which the United States has -- on which the United States has agreed to be sued? Is -- is there any such case?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4884 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4885 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and you think it's clear that -- as our sovereign immunity law requires, that such a third party beneficiary can sue the United States?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4886 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ For example, in the U.S. v. District Court case decided by this Court in 1971, under the McCarran Act, that fact situation was not before you, but the Court did say that the rights to which the statute referred were all inclusive. It read it broadly.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4887 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I don't understand that. The rights were all inclusive. As -- as I understand the law of third party beneficiaries, it -- it used to be -- and -- and perhaps at the time this statute was enacted still was -- quite -- quite restrictive. It's only in more recent -- I don't agree with the Government's argument that -- that you have to, in an ordinary contract, explicitly refer to the third party beneficiary's rights. But when sovereign immunity is at issue, it's -- it's a different question, it seems to me.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4888 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we have explicit rights here and -- and it would seem to me that if -- if -- and this was certainly the legislative history behind section 221, not -- not behind McCarran. But if -- if the same duty is owed by the promisor to the third party that it owes to the promisee, and if the third party has the same rights of enforcement as it does under 304 of the Restatement that the promisee would have, why should it be any different? Why would Congress have intended to exclude that? And it used the word contract.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4889 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because -- because we have a rule that says when Congress wants the United States to be sued, it -- it must say so clearly.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4890 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You also have the rule that the word contract means the law of contract and not parts of it.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4891 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But yes, isn't it arguable, though, that in this case the Government probably thought that it would be efficient to have the district represent all the farmers for whatever their -- to the extent their interests were shared with one another, rather than having every individual have the same right to bring -- bring a lawsuit?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4892 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Efficient in -- in collecting land assessments and water charges, but there's no evidence in the -- either the language of the statute, I submit, or the --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4893 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Except for the fact that the district is the party to the contract, though.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4894 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Nothing was said about litigation, let alone intended third party beneficiary --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4895 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but the -- the whole point of the district -- correct if I'm wrong. This is your area. The whole point of the district was to make it easier for the United States to know with whom it was dealing to have an efficient system, and if you say, well, that doesn't include lawsuits for damages, it seems to me that destroys much of the purpose of the formation of the district.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4896 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's a lot of legislative history there, and it talks a great deal, as you say, Your Honor, about efficiency and -- and the convenience. But it's not talking at all about litigation, about remedies, about rights once there's a breach.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4897 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you haven't really achieved very much efficiency if you simply get the United States out of the business of collecting the payments and of keeping track of the payments but leave the United States subject to suit when the person who has authority to do -- do these things goofs. I mean, what -- what trouble has the United States saved itself? It would still have to ride herd over -- over the person with -- with whom it's dealing.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4898 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- this is a transaction between a water seller and many water buyers. Yes, in 1926 districts were put in the middle, but it's also true in 1939 in -- in the section 9(e), Congress authorized the particular type of contracts we have here, so-called water service contracts, and it doesn't mention district. And as a matter of fact, the Ninth Circuit has held that the bureau had the discretion administratively to deal with individuals. So throughout the history of the reclamation program, you -- you have the -- the core transaction is -- is a water sale from the Government to -- to farmers. And that's was the case on day one in 1902 and it still is. And I'd just like to remind the Court that paragraph 3 of the stipulated judgment at page 110 of the joint appendix is in our view dispositive here. This was a -- an agreement by the United States and the district, approved by a court after formal settlement notice was dispatched to two formal classes, and it says, any appropriate relief may be obtained against the Federal parties by the filing of a new action for violation of any contract arising independently of this judgment.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4899 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the -- the Justice Department has no authority to -- to consent to suit which -- which Congress has not consented to. I don't see how this strengthens your case.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4900 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Again, if -- if this Court should hold that neither of the two statutes on -- on which we stand waive sovereign immunity, and --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4901 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And this alone wouldn't -- wouldn't remedy the --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4902 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then -- then --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4903 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the absence --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4904 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the decision that we're not intended beneficiaries should be vacated and we should have a chance to go to the court -- Claims Court. I'd like to reserve, Your Honor, 3 minutes, if I may.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4905 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You may, indeed, Mr. Smiland. Mr. Minear, I think you're up next.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4907 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Petitioners cannot maintain this suit for breach of the Westlands contract because the Westlands contract is itself subject to the rules of sovereign immunity. And section 390uu authorizes only a limited waiver of sovereign immunity. It does not authorize suits by incidental beneficiaries for money damages. For many of the points that have already been raised by Justice Breyer, Justice Kennedy --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4908 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Minear, do you think it does waive sovereign immunity for suits brought by the district?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4909 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In one circumstance, Your Honor. This suit allows a district that has been sued by individual water users to join the United States in the ongoing suit and, in fact, remove the case to Federal court if necessary, so there can be a determination of all the rights in those --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4910 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did this suit begin as a suit by a water user against the district and then you were joined later? Is that --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4911 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it did not, but that did occur in the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation that ran between 1978 and 1980.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4912 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, in this suit, did not the district bring it against the United States?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4913 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4914 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And was that a -- was that jurisdiction proper at that time?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4915 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That suit was brought under the APA, and the district brought the suit on that basis.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4916 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But was it properly brought is what I'm asking you.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4917 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That suit was properly brought.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4918 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4919 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it was not brought under 390uu. Instead, there was an allegation that the United States had acted unlawfully and the Westlands relied on the Administrative Procedure Act.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4920 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And no money damages.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4921 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And no money damages as well, and that's what distinguishes this case.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4922 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So that -- so your view -- I mean, what -- what makes sense to me is that the section means what it says, that consent is given to join the United States. That means join them in an ongoing suit. And it makes sense because what the United States wants is anyone who sues them for money damages goes to the Court of Claims. But of course, where you have an ongoing suit between two other people, we'll make an exception because there it's already in another district and we'll let you bring the United States in as a necessary party. The other exception is when you don't sue for money damages. That's in section 702 of the APA. Now, that to me makes a lot of sense and it's consistent with the language. Is that your view or do you have a different view?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4923 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, that is our view, and let me supplement your comments in this regard. Section --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4924 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I -- may I -- has that always been your view throughout? (Laughter.)
03-1566 +++$+++ 4925 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It has been our view under 390uu when section 390uu has been -- has been raised.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4926 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But throughout the litigation?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4927 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Throughout this litigation? I can't -- I can't be sure that we've maintained a consistent position, but ultimately this is a question of sovereign immunity. So the importance is that we get the issue right here.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4928 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There has to be an ongoing suit. You think this section does -- does not permit somebody to initiate suit against one party and at the same time against the United States as a necessary party.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4929 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, let me explain why that's the case, and there was an answer --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4930 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why what is the case?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4935 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The language could be construed to allow that, but -- but waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly, and the language I think is more properly construed, as Justice Breyer has suggested, to allow joinder as a necessary party. And in fact, it was enacted in specific reaction to that problem in the Barcellos & Wolfsen litigation where we did have ongoing litigation and there was a sense by the irrigation district they needed to join the United States so they would not be subject to inconsistent suits. So although I think that the language can bear the -- the interpretation that you're suggesting, Justice Scalia, nevertheless, I think the better interpretation is the more narrow one that is --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4936 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then -- then how do you explain the last -- the last sentence of that provision, which is any suit pursuant to this section? The only suit that the section refers to is a suit in which the United States is joined as a necessary party defendant. That's the subject of the section.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4937 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, and --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4938 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and the last sentence says, any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States district court. And I read that to mean if you want to sue the United States as a necessary party initiating a suit, you can bring it in -- in any district court in which the land involved is.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4939 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, we read that as allowing removal in those circumstances when the United States is joined later. In any event, I have to say that with regard to -- to this disagreement, it does -- it's not dispositive or even affect the case here. The fact is that this waiver of sovereign immunity under no circumstances would allow this suit to go forward. Apart from the money damages aspect, which itself is -- is -- would preclude this type of suit, these parties are not intended beneficiaries, and without being intended beneficiaries, there's -- in no circumstances could they ever evoke these provisions.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4940 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Minear, when you say -- when you say not money damages, do you read the words that I read to Mr. Smiland restrictively or do you think they accommodate money damages, that is, suit to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree the contractual rights of a contracting entity?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4941 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We think that under your cases, such as Pena v. Lane, there needs to be a specific reference to money damages. This simply is referencing declaratory relief, and so we do not believe it would allow an award of money damages. Rather, the party must go to the Claims Court if they're seeking money damages. And in fact, the waiver of sovereign immunity there is somewhat broader. It does, as mentioned before, allow implied or express contracts. So this suit is simply in the wrong court. But I would like to --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4942 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So money damages -- waiver always used the word money damages. When it says adjudicate the rights under the contract, that doesn't include money damages?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4943 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I do not think in this context it would. I think there needs to be something more specific. We're really talking about declaring rights here and not providing a specific remedy. And this Court has always taken the view that the Claims Court jurisdiction is the appropriate forum for deciding money damages.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4944 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What about the second sentence?The United States, when a party, shall be deemed to have waived any right to plead that it is not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty and shall be subject to judgments, orders, and decrees of the court having jurisdiction and may obtain review thereof in the same manner and to the same extent? It's subject to the judgments, orders, and decrees of the court to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances. Why isn't that enough to -- to say that the court can -- can award damages?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4945 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I think that simply refers back to the previous sentence, which refers to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree. Now, if you interpret that to include money damages, then the second sentence would follow, but I -- I think the two have to be construed together. And in our view simply allowing a party to adjudicate, confirm, validate, or decree in these circumstances would not allow award of money damages. Certainly I think Congress would be much clearer.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4946 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but if contractual rights include a right to be paid for something, why wouldn't you get a money judgment in a case like that? That first sentence certainly covers the possibility of a contractual right to be paid something.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4947 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, again, waivers of sovereign immunity are construed narrowly. Now, let's --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4948 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's pretty clear language.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4949 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- I have to say that the language -- you're saying that the language -- yes, could it conceivably be -- be interpreted in -- on -- that broadly. But that's not --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4950 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Certainly if it were not a -- a United States and were a private individual, it would include money damages.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4951 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That might well be, but this is --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4952 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and the next sentence, as Justice Scalia points out, says the United States shall be treated just like a private party.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4953 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. But Your Honor, ultimately I think that we have to focus on that this is a waiver of sovereign immunity. And -- and so far we have not touched on the question of whether these parties --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4954 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think you've got a very strong argument when you talk about an incidental third party beneficiary not being a contracting party, but now you're asking for a much broader holding than really necessary to dispose of this case, it seems to me.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4955 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I think I started with that point, that an incidental beneficiary cannot invoke this -- this provision. And I'd like to -- to continue with that point because the party here is merely an incidental beneficiary and not an intended beneficiary. Under any of the -- the tests that have been applied for third party beneficiaries, the party here would not qualify as an intended beneficiary. Most importantly, the contracting parties here, the United States and Westlands, expressed no intent to give this party enforcement rights. What's more, the contract does not provide that performance would be rendered to -- to the petitioners in this case. The contract is quite clear that performance is rendered to Westlands. This is a contract in which the United States furnishes a specified amount of water to Westlands and Westlands pays money for it. Westlands then has a separate obligation with regard to the farmers.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4956 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Separate from -- where does that -- that obligation come from?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4957 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That arises from the regulations that the Westlands Water District has enacted that provides for the delivery of water from Westlands to the individual farmers. The United States' obligation --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4958 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a State -- a State created obligation?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4959 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. That is -- and Westlands has the -- has the option of either engaging in contracts with the individual farmers or distributing the water through regulation, and it has opted for regulations. Now, Westlands itself is a governmental unit. It is comprised of the -- of the very farmers here, among others, who have brought this suit. And it has the authority to act in a representative capacity on behalf of all its members. And that is why the United States enters into contracts with irrigation districts precisely because it allows them to reach accord and agreement and to resolve their disputes. Now, the fact is that the United States and Westlands agree on a great many things. Sometimes they disagree, but when we disagree, we're able to -- to speak to one another as two governments representing constituencies and hammer out our differences. And that would be impossible if these types of third party beneficiary suits were allowed. And I think that goes to the crux of what the United States' real concern here is. When there are contracts between one government and another, just as in the context of treaties or compacts among the States, it's vital that the two governmental units be able to deal with one another as governments and to be assured that if they can reach accord on behalf of their representatives -- on behalf of the parties they represent, that that will resolve the issue. If it were otherwise, this type of distribution of water --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4960 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you don't take the position, do you, that Westlands could have agreed with the United States that it wouldn't enforce its new laws that deprived the farmers of water? You don't take that position.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4961 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But let's look at what would happen, Your Honor, if that did happen. The individual farmers would sue Westlands, claiming that Westlands was not living up to its contract obligations. Westlands would invoke 390uu and join the United States in that suit. And the question of the legal rights would be determined on that basis. So the mechanism that -- that we've specified and the way that we interpret it deals precisely with the problem that you've -- you've addressed.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4962 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but you can't -- the -- presumably the Federal Government can't negotiate away the Endangered Species Act or something. The fact is that new laws were passed after these contracts were entered into with Westlands. Isn't that right?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4963 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. And again, I think it's instructive to see what happened in this case. When those laws were enacted, the United States reacted to those. Westlands brought a suit under the APA challenging the interpretation of the statutes. Westlands was entitled to do that under the APA. The United States and Westlands reached an accord, together with the environmental intervenors in this group, that was satisfactory to those parties. And it simply would be very disruptive of the system if a minority of farmers in the Westlands District could then bring a suit and upset that agreement and that accord that had been reached. Finally, I'd like to make a brief --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4964 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can the district get damages from the Government?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4965 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Technically yes, but their damages are limited by the terms of the contract. Westlands could sue the United States in Claims Court for a breach of the contract, but the contract itself says that any damages that are -- that the sole liability of the United States in these circumstances would be an adjustment of the account. In other words, there are not consequential damages. Rather, if we do not provide Westlands with the water that Westlands believes it's entitled to, then we stand liable for an adjustment in the payments that Westlands would make to us. The suit that is being brought here is asking for consequential damages, and we believe that the contract here does not allow consequential damages. That, of course, is a merits question that there's no need for the Court to reach, but that is the way it would be resolved in Claims Court in -- in our view. I'd like to also raise the question of property rights since that has -- has come up, that one of the arguments that has been made by Westlands is that they're entitled to status of a third party beneficiary because they claim they have water rights in these circumstances. The fact is that the United States, the State of California, and Westlands, as well as the California Water Resources Board and the first tier of California courts, have all concluded they do not have the -- the water rights that they claim. But in any event, our view is that that issue is irrelevant to the inquiry here. Rather, the question of third party beneficiary status turns on the intent of the contracting parties. Did they or did they not intend to give enforceable rights to the third party? Here there's not a shred of evidence that that was an intent -- there was an intent to create enforceable rights in that third party. Quite to the contrary. The only reference of third parties, the farmers, in the contract here is directed to limitations on what the district can do once it receives its water. It doesn't create rights in them -- the individual farmers. Quite to the contrary. What it does it restricts the ability of the district in order to protect the United States' interests, to make sure the United States will be paid for the water that it ultimately provides to the district. The central point that I would like to leave you with, though, here at the end is the importance of protecting the relationship between the United States and Westlands. But although we disagree on some matters, we are able to reach accommodation and agreement, and when we're able to do that, it's to the good of all concerned. The contracts and the laws here are structured to allow those types of agreements to be reached, and we think that allowing third party beneficiary suits would be very disruptive of that -- that operation.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4966 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Minear. Mr. Somach, will you tell us what the district's views on this whole matter are?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4968 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Westlands Water District has argued in its brief that petitioners are not intended third party beneficiaries with enforceable rights under the 1963 contract. I want to make two points from the perspective of the district why this must be so. First, allowing a direct right of action by petitioners is not practical or consistent with the district's need and ability to function as a governmental entity and to allocate all of the water that it receives under contract to all of the landowners within the -- the district. This is a scarce and valuable resource, and these types of third party lawsuits jeopardize the district's ability to be able to provide water pursuant to California Water Code provisions to all of the landowners within the district. Second, the laws of the State of California and reclamation law, working in harmony one with the other --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4969 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Excuse me. Could you expand on the first point a little bit? I mean, you say you don't want to be bothered with lawsuits. Is -- is that -- is that all that it amounts to?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4970 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I -- I think quite on the contrary. You know, and unfortunately, the -- the history of this contract and these -- these issues has been anything other than the district avoiding litigation. The -- the whole concept of a water district is not to individualize or incrementalize the water and interests in water in any one group of landowners or any one landowner. The idea is that the rights of all of the landowners to all of the water under the contract are to be treated as a whole and allow the district to provide protection to all of the landowners within the district as a whole, the point there being that the water doesn't belong to any one landowner or a group of landowners. It belongs to the whole. And in fact, the way the district operates, the way it has to operate is in the context of the whole. Bonds are issued. Encumbrances on lands are -- are incurred, all based upon not individual rights to water but rather broad rights of water throughout the district. To allow a small group of landowners to decide how to administer the contract, how to enforce the contract in any one given situation leaves decisions that are critical to all of the landowners solely in the hands of an unaccountable small group of -- of landowners.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4971 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can't -- can't such a suit be brought in State court? I can't believe that this district can do whatever it wants with the water.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4972 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, absolutely not. Yes, it -- yes, it can.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4973 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Really?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4974 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. What I meant to say was yes, you are right.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4975 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4976 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And absolutely not. It can't do just anything it wants to do. It is subject, as a governmental entity, to all the strict requirements of California water law and governmental law, for that matter. If, for example, these petitioners decide for whatever reason they don't like a decision of the -- of the board -- and in fact, that is an example that exists emanating out of the facts of this case. When the district decided that it was better to settle the litigation, these landowners first petitioned the -- the governing of the -- of the district and sought to -- to have them not proceed in that manner, the way any other group of citizens or constituents with any other governmental entity would have proceeded. The district decided, however, that it was in the best interests of all of the landowners within the district to settle the litigation. Now, at that point in time certainly, these petitioners had the normal and ordinary rights that any -- any constituent within the district has to be able to challenge a decision that has been made by the district. That includes, for example, writ proceedings, to argue that the decision of the board was arbitrary, capricious, otherwise unlawful, and that it should -- should be mandated to -- to proceed in some other fashion. If the issue were damages, this district is subject, like any other governmental entity within the State of California, to the government Tort Claims Act if -- if they're tortious type damages. And if we have arguable impairment of property rights, this district is subject to the California constitution, the United States Constitution, and the government code provisions that provide for litigation with respect to those broader types of -- of damages. And quite frankly, this is a governmental body and it is very susceptible to the political process. It is not an easy thing for -- for the district to be standing up here and telling you that its landowners aren't entitled to receive what they want. That's a very difficult for the district to -- to do. But in dealing with the rights of the entire district, it's an absolute essential thing to do. If these landowners had exercised their prerogatives under California law, they could have, assuming they were the majority, controlled the decisions of the board of directors in the way that any majority constituency controls the director -- the -- the direction and the decisions of a -- of a governing board. You know, this -- this lawsuit is instructive in -- in a number of ways in terms of these practical concerns that we have in terms of how in the world are we going to be able to administer a contract like this one. How are we going to do all of the things that the Water Code has told us that we have to do if, at any given time, a landowner, a small group of landowners is able to go into Federal district court and independently decide that it wants to administer the contract that the district has with the United States or to enforce terms of the contract that it has with the United States in a manner that's inconsistent or different than the way --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4977 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't really understand why that's any greater burden than the fact they can sue you in State court anyway. They -- they can always bring litigation.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4978 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it -- it really requires the district to, in a sense, race to the courthouse with the -- with the petitioners in order to be there first in order to have its views of the contract --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4979 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the suit in State court, I assume, would -- would only be -- the claim would be that you were acting arbitrarily, and so long as your interpretation of the contract was a reasonable one, the suit would fail.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4980 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4981 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Whereas, this suit here -- it doesn't matter how reasonable it is. If it's wrong, it's wrong. I mean, it's quite a different --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4982 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I think it is a different situation, and I agree with what you -- what you have said, Your Honor. I do, however, want to -- to not avoid the concern that may be expressed here, and -- and that is, that -- that what it does is it -- it forces the district into a situation of chasing its landowners, in essence, around from one litigation forum to another in order to ensure that its means of controlling and -- and administering the contract is not jeopardized. The fact that the landowners -- if the landowners can move forward independently with litigation with respect to the contract, what it really does is create in a sense a -- the contract becomes this very interesting moving target where the district has its views about what the contract is and how it should be administered, how it should be enforced, and then it proceeds in one direction as, for example, it did with the settlement in this litigation, deciding that that was the best way to protect the interests of the district. Had these petitioners on the merits in a hypothetical situation prevailed with a totally different result, that would have substantially affected and impacted the district's ability to be able to maintain the obligations and the commitments that it made to the other settling parties. That destabilizes the ability of the district to actually act in other governmental forums, in forums with the United States, with the State of California, with other districts in the context of attempting to say we control the contract, we enforce its terms, and we can make commitments. And when we make those commitments, we can abide by and we can live up to those commitments in a way that -- that governments ought to be able to do when they're -- when they're making those types of commitments. Having the landowners being able to come or -- and here, I want to make certain. When I use the word landowners, I'm not saying that the landowners are not beneficiaries of the contract. They certainly are.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4983 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What about the provision in the judgment at page 110 that was -- that was cited to us, that -- that the parties may obtain other appropriate relief by the filing of a new action?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4984 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SOMACH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I -- I think that that -- that phrase is actually begun as a proviso, and I view it as not limiting the ability of the area I landowners in the Barcellos & Wolfsen judgment that you're -- that you're quoting from from being able to act in any other way. It was a non-limiting provision. The -- the first part of the -- the part that you read deals with what their rights to enforce were. The second part was a proviso that simply said notwithstanding this, whatever else you're able to do, you may do. Thank you for your time.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4985 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Somach. Mr. Smiland, you have 9 minutes remaining, but you do not have to use it all.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4987 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Your Honor. What happened here is that the United States sold half the water it was obligated to sell under the contract. It doubled the price it was permitted to charge on the other half. It was a massive harm to the farmers. I'm sure you understand.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4988 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you say under the contract. I thought there was a provision in the contract that said that the United States will not be responsible for under-deliveries, and I think it listed the drought and the last thing was any other cause.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4989 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's what we were about to go to trial on, Your Honor. That's a merits issue. The Ninth Circuit has abstained on whether there was a mandatory statutory duty to cut off this water, and I urge the Court not to -- to dive into that pool. We're trying to get in the courthouse doors.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4990 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you were saying there's -- there's a right under this contract to recover from the United States for an under-delivery.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4991 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We have massive cross summary judgment motions on that issue and we were entitled to go to trial on that -- on our claim of liability.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4992 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4993 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If --
03-1566 +++$+++ 4994 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, please.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4995 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I've asked a lot of questions. Go on.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4996 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What do you make -- excuse me. What do you make of the argument for reasonable construction of the contract that in fact you just simply cannot have a system that would promise the chaos that -- that you are promising?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4997 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I don't make much of it. The parties here and -- and the parties in the West fully understood for 20 years, after Allen Orchards, that the farmers were intended third party beneficiaries. That's -- we settled in 1986 with that understanding, and this parade of horribles just has not come to pass.
03-1566 +++$+++ 4998 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is -- is it correct, as Justice Scalia suggested earlier, that so far as State litigation is concerned, it would be limited simply to arbitrary, unreasonable behavior?
03-1566 +++$+++ 4999 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true. And even more fundamentally, the United States breached the contract. The district didn't do anything wrong. Why would we sue the district when the United States cut off the water and doubled the charge?
03-1566 +++$+++ 5000 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think it's arbitrary not to -- not to -- for an agency, of which you're -- you're in some sense at least the beneficiary, not to insist upon its contract rights, just as a shareholder can insist that the -- that a corporation enforce its contracts.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5001 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We had a little mini-trial on that in front of the -- in front of the district court, and -- and I made that argument, Your Honor, and the district court rejected it.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5002 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, he was wrong. That was -- (Laughter.)
03-1566 +++$+++ 5003 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I agree.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5004 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I guess the reason that you would sue the district would be if you didn't have any enforceable promise from the United States that they didn't -- wouldn't do it.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5005 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we -- we --
03-1566 +++$+++ 5006 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, you think you do. That's the issue in the case.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5007 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We had a stipulated judgment.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5008 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And so therefore -- therefore, I'm looking for where that promise is. And you started out by citing a page, which wasn't a page of the contract. It was a page of some kind of settlement, and that page said that the district agrees that they entered into the contract with helping the farmers in mind. I'm sure they did. So what. I mean, I might buy a house with the idea of helping of my child. I'm going to give it to him. That doesn't mean he can enforce the contract.

03-1566 +++$+++ 5010 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You mean my child can enforce a contract I enter into with another -- I buy a house and I say I intend to give it to my daughter.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5011 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the contract --
03-1566 +++$+++ 5012 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And then she can enforce the contract?
03-1566 +++$+++ 5013 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the contract says --
03-1566 +++$+++ 5014 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. If the contract says. Now, that's why I was interested that you didn't cite language in the contract.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5015 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes, we did, Your Honor.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5016 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You -- well, I mean, you started out by referring me to page 110 or 111 --
03-1566 +++$+++ 5017 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true.
03-1566 +++$+++ 5018 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- which doesn't. Now, what is the language in the contract --
03-1566 +++$+++ 5019 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMILAND +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Articles --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5029 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Mr. Lamken, it's not as comprehensive as other schemes where the Court said, on that basis, we would not find a section 1983 cause of action, is it? I mean, it's -- it's more spare.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5030 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it is unusual in its unique focus on private enforcement, but there was a reason for the focus on private enforcement. In other provisions of the Communications Act, the Congress chose -- for example, section 253, Congress chose to eliminate enforcement at -- at the FCC level because it was concerned that State and local governments often wouldn't have enough -- excuse me -- local governments in particular --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5031 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what -- what --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5032 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- wouldn't be able to -- I'm sorry.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5033 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What would you think of a case where the plaintiff alleges that the antenna zoning was the -- was caused by racial discrimination against the applicant? Would there be a 1983 cause of action, do you suppose?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5034 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. That would still be available because the -- the section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) only provides for a cause of action for violations of the Communications Act. Violations of the Constitution continue to be enforceable directly under section 1983. Section -- section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) is comprehensive in the relevant sense in that for every violation of section 332(c)(7), for every person adversely aggrieved, it provides a mechanism for private judicial enforcement. In addition --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5035 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what about -- it -- it -- section 332 speaks of an award of all appropriate relief. What does that include? Could it include punitive damages? Could it include attorney's fees, do you think?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5036 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In that respect, it is indistinguishable -- for example, the statute that was at issue in Smith v. Robinson, and it doesn't specify the precise forms of relief available. In our view in this case, appropriate relief would mean specific relief, the type of relief that is traditionally given on review of zoning decisions and on review of judicial review of agency action. That's supported by a number of considerations. I should point out, in the first instance, that in this case respondent never did seek damages, or punitive damages for that matter, under section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself. But that's supported by a number of considerations. First is the structure of the act, which presents it as a form of judicial review of agency action. The act is structured much as you have -- much as you would when a Federal agency enforces or implements Federal requirements and are subject to judicial review. The only difference is that Congress swapped in, effectively, State and local agencies with the initial implementers in place of the Federal Government. In that respect, it shares some of the characteristics of sections 251 and 252 of the Communications Act which are also implemented by local -- by -- excuse me -- by State governments as opposed to the FCC.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5037 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. -- Mr. Lamken, the argument has been made that 4 years before the telecommunications act we're talking about was adopted, Congress adopted the Cable TV Consumer Protection Act. And in that act, it specifically limited the remedies to declaratory and injunctive relief. Here we face silence. Isn't that an indication that when Congress wants to limit relief to declaratory and injunctive, it will say so in the -- in the measure?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5038 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, that -- that's an example where Congress, for a broad range of statutes that could be potentially used to enforce the Cable Act, chose to restrict the forms of relief available. And it is an example, in the words of Sea Clammers, where Congress has made its intent explicit in the text of the statute. Congress can also by implication limit the forms of -- excuse me -- limit the mechanism for relief that's available, and that's our position here, that Congress by providing --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5039 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What's the -- what's the source of the implication?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5040 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Pardon?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5041 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You say by implication.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5042 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The implication -- Congress has provided a specific mechanism for judicial relief here, section 332(c)(7)(B)(v) itself, and that is a highly adapted mechanism which includes unique characteristics such as a very short limitations period.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5043 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so the -- the implication, I -- I guess, is that unless it specifically provides for damages, it implicitly does not.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5044 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry. In terms of Congress making damages available under 332(c)(7)(B)(v), our view of the damage -- mind you damages are only one of the differences we think that exists here, but our view is supported by a number of considerations, in addition to the structure of the statute. For example, appropriate relief is often -- is the traditional form of relief available. In this context traditional relief was always specific relief. Congress also included a specific savings clause that extends not merely to Federal statutes, but prohibits the impairment --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5045 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Excuse me. Where -- where are you getting the term, appropriate relief, from?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5046 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This -- that comes from this Court's decision in Franklin, that where Congress doesn't specifically identify the specific forms of relief available --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5047 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. But that's -- that's not in the -- that's not in the text of this statute, is it?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5048 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, it isn't. It is an inference the Court draws from silence. When the Court -- when Congress provides an express cause of action and does not identify the specific forms of relief available, the Court will infer that Congress intended to provide all appropriate relief. But the term, appropriate relief, is that relief which Congress would have intended, and when the Court is determining that, it takes a look at what the traditional forms of relief are and it will look at things such as the savings clause in 601(c), which expressly says that the statute should not be read, unless it expressly provides, to supersede, impair, or otherwise modify State and local law, as well as Federal law. And in order to put damages into the statute, if it doesn't provide damages expressly, one would have to impair myriad municipal immunity laws that otherwise protect municipalities and State and local officers implementing zoning requirements from liability. Finally, the FCC has --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5049 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and 1983 is not subject to that limitation.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5050 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, 1983 is expressly preemptive under this Court's decisions, and it is -- it would preempt the State laws by its own force. But we believe that that also supports Congress' decision not to provide -- or supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend to provide section 1983 relief here because the effect of making the Communications Act enforceable under section 1983 would be to expand the categories of claims for which -- that -- those immunities are unavailable, and it would thereby impair those immunities.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5051 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But are they only immune from damages action or are they immune from suit?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5052 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. They're generally immunities -- immune from damages actions, not from suits.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5053 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So, I mean, that proves too much because they -- the statute obviously intends to eliminate that immunity. The immunity from suit is -- is clearly --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5054 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, I think -- I think you may have misunderstood. The immunity is not from suit. It's an immunity from damages and the impairment would be the immunity from damages. Section 332 is not designed to impair the municipal immunity statutes, and they are not immunities from suit. They are generally from damage liability. The officers are subject to suit because these are subject --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5055 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it allows suit against either municipalities or States, State or local governments. Right?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5056 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5057 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the States have immunity not just from damages but from suit.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5058 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As a constitutional matter, they have an immunity from suit, but --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5059 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Unless they have chosen to waive it, which --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5060 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5061 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- one must assume in this area they haven't.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5062 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5063 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you have to regard this provision as intentionally overriding some provisions of State law in -- inasmuch as they apply to -- to immunity.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5064 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, first of all, I don't think it would be read to -- to override the State's constitutional immunity to suit.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5065 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. That's --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5066 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it would be read to -- it would be read to override immunities to suit that exist under State law because otherwise it couldn't be affected.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5067 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In for a penny, in for a pound.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5068 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5069 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If they've -- if they've waived --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5070 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I'm not --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5071 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If -- if you acknowledge that it was intended to affect their immunity from suit, why -- why would we suspect that it was not intended to affect their immunity from damages?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5072 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, because it would be -- it would be a provision with no effect whatsoever if it didn't override immunities to suit. But I'm not sure there are provisions that are providing for -- I mean, that there are myriad damages immunity laws that provide municipalities absolute immunity from suit. It's fairly common, at least under California and other State law, for municipalities to be subject to suit for review of their -- of the actions that they make. And that is the typical fashion that this -- this statute simply incorporated that typical fashion of providing judicial review of agency action. Another consideration that supports the view that section 1983 has been displaced is that the act provides an entire process for the implementation of the Federal statutes. It establishes Federal substantive requirements that identifies the agencies to implement them. It provides Federal procedural guarantees, APA-like guarantees, like the requirement of substantial evidence, like the requirement of a written decision, like the requirement of a decision with a reasonable period of time. It then follows up with a mechanism, an adapted mechanism for judicial review. In that sense, it is very much like the statute at issue in Smith v. Robinson. That elaborate process is particularly significant given the pattern of the Communications Act as a whole. The Communications Act repeatedly matches specific regulatory requirements such as, for example, the common carrier requirements in 202 and 203, with corresponding mechanisms for private enforcement, such as an action for suit -- I mean, an action for damages in court or an enforcement action in the commission in sections 206 and 207.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5073 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does this action have to be brought in Federal court? It says any court of competent jurisdiction. Could --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5074 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. The action can be brought in State court and often is. There are about 50 reported decisions that we have found where the suit has been brought in State court. I haven't seen a particular pattern between the choice, but Congress gave the option.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5075 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would a State court be free to award damages or would that be preempted under the view you take of the statute?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5076 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The State -- because there's an express preservation of State law in this context, I think that State -- States would be free to award damages under their own laws. They wouldn't -- whatever relief is available under the Federal statute would be available under the available under the Federal statute, and State courts wouldn't be free to second-guess Congress' judgment as to what relief should be provided under Federal statute.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5077 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the State court allowed damages -- if -- if the State system allowed -- State law allowed damages, would the Federal court, in an action under this section, be allowed to award damages under that -- under the State statute?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5078 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I think since the -- the provision, the savings clause, says that the statute should not be construed to impair State law -- and there are so many municipal immunity statutes and you would only have one construction of the statute -- I believe that the construction would be an across-the-boards construction, that this act does not provide damages and you would not vary from State to State.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5079 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What if the State law authorized the recovery of attorney's fees? Would they be recoverable?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5080 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Pardon?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5081 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What if the State law authorized the recovery of attorney's fees?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5082 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5083 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What would you do then?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5084 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the State law provides for recovery of attorney's fees for State violations, then that would control for State violations. For violations of Federal law, the -- the remedies that Congress chose to provide would control and the States would not be permitted to second-guess the -- the remedies --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5085 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not sure why that would be if you, in fact, see the statute as trying to impose an APA-like structure, saying to the States, you decide the substance, we'll give you minimum elements of form, which helps your position. Then if the minimum elements of form are not specifically stated in the statute, there's no reason to interfere with the States. Let them do what they want. Only those minimum elements are what you can't do. That works perfectly for you.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5086 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5087 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's strongly supported in the history. It may lose your client the money. I don't know.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5088 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in fact, California provides a municipal immunity for permitting decisions, and so my client --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5089 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So then you're only --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5090 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- would be fine with your position. But that is a potential inference. My -- the normal view would be that where Congress provides a -- a statute, one would normally presume that Congress intended a particular set of remedies to accompany it. You could say that the silence is meant to -- meant to reflect the fact that Congress knew that these would be enforced in State courts, as well as Federal, and it would allow State courts --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5091 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Congress didn't care.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5092 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- to use whatever --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5093 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Congress wanted to substitute a Federal judgment for the judgment of the States where it said so. And the reason you know that is because that is what is consistent with the purpose of the act and other things are either neutral or negative. Don't interfere with the State unless you have to.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5094 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is one of our principal contentions, Justice Breyer, which is --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5095 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And what, Mr. Lamken, would be the normal procedure in the State? You make an application for a permit to a zoning board. What is the standard operating procedure under State law? Suppose we don't have any telecommunications act in the picture.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5096 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The normal procedure is either under a uniform State law or California law. If you have a -- an entity which is -- excuse me. If you have either a planning commission or sometimes there's another entity that does the initial review and makes a determination whether to grant the permit. It is then appealable either to a zoning board of adjustment -- that's the -- the model act -- or in California, States -- localities have the option of having the appeal go to the local legislature. That appeal is then reviewed -- is then determined. And finally, once you've gone through that process, under California law it's generally reviewable by a writ of mandate, although other -- other States provide review by writ of certiorari, by mandamus, or by various other procedures, almost always subject to a short limitations period, almost always short -- requiring finality, a final decision, exhaustion through the State process.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5097 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the remedies being injunctive and declaratory.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5098 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A -- a form of specific relief. Generally they have the authority to effectively go in and revise the decision below, but the remedies ordinarily do not include monetary or compensatory relief I should say.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5099 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are you saying that it's parallel to what APA review of an agency decision would be?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's very much like that. The remand rule that this Court normally requires in the APA context is not so strictly observed in the context of -- of review of -- judicial review of zoning decisions, but it is very much like APA review. That is what prevails.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it seems to me that the 30-day provision is inconsistent with the award of damages, but after I say that, I can't tell you why. (Laughter.)
03-1601 +++$+++ 5102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, actually this Court's decision in Burnett v. Grattan actually tells you why, and that is that 30-day provisions, which are typical for on-the-record review of decisions below, are often insufficient to allow somebody to develop a whole new record such as their proof of damages, to make important decisions if they're going to have, for example, a jury trial, or to prepare for discovery. And that's why 30-day provisions are not entirely uncommon in the area of judicial review of agency action, but they're wholly unprecedented, for the most part that I know of, in the area of tort-like remedies like section 1983. If I -- if there are no further questions, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, you may. Mr. Feldman.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5105 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Where Congress creates a special cause of action for -- for a violation of a Federal law that necessarily carries with it its own features and incidents, Congress' decisions about the appropriate mechanisms for dealing with that violation of Federal law should not be frustrated or overridden by allowing a 1983 action in addition. In this case, section 332(c)(7)(B)(v), which creates a cause of action for violation of the specific standards in (i) through (iv) is an independent, standalone cause of action. If 1983 didn't exist, 332(c)(7)(B)(v) would, undoubtedly, still provide plaintiffs with a mechanism to get into court and attain redress for the legal wrongs that they claim. Where Congress has taken that step and has thought about what the appropriate remedy should be for a violation of a particular Federal statute and has created a judicial remedy, then it would only frustrate --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5106 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it -- the statute, though, is silent on the question of damages or attorney's fees, isn't it?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5107 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is. It doesn't say anything expressly about either of those things, but I think it has long been --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5108 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can we infer all appropriate relief? Do we?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5109 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As a matter of damages, I think all appropriate relief would be the standard. But as a matter of attorney's fees, I think is a good example of why there shouldn't be a 1983 action here because the law is 100 percent clear, from this Court's decision in Alyeska and other cases, that where Congress hasn't provided for fee-shifting, there simply is no fee-shifting authorized. That's what they intended.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5110 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Attorney's fees are never appropriate, in other words.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5111 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are never appropriate unless Congress specifically provides for them.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5112 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it has provided for them for a 1983 action, and if it's a 1983 action, it takes care of it.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5113 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5114 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And this is kind of circular.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5115 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think it's circular because I think when Congress created the specific cause of action here in (B)(v), it didn't provide for attorney's fees and therefore intended that attorney's fees not be provided. If respondent's view in this case were accepted, the -- the presumption would be exactly flipped, and Congress would have had --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5116 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Feldman --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose Congress said specifically 1983 applies. That's all it says. Would that carry with it attorney's fees in your view?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I -- yes, I think it -- I think it would. The question here, though, is where Congress has thought about what kind of remedy it wants for violation of a Federal statute and created a judicial cause of action for every wrong that's -- that -- that can exist under that statute, then the incidents and features of that cause of action should govern, not the incidents and features of 1983 which almost inevitably and in this case are different. And attorney's fees is just the best example of that. If -- under respondent's view -- when Congress was fashioning this statute, it certainly was aware of this Court's decisions that have repeatedly said that attorney's fees are not available unless they're expressly provided for. And indeed, elsewhere in the Communications Act --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I take -- you -- you take the position that 1983 doesn't apply at all. It's not just attorney's fees. It's damages.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right. But it's just an illustration. There's other differences between the provision here and 1983, but I think the basic point is that where Congress has given thought to the remedy for a particular violation -- type of violation of Federal law and has provided for a judicial cause of action, with whatever features and incidents it -- it wants, 1983 shouldn't be allowed in. It should be assumed that Congress didn't want to have its decisions frustrated by also allowing a 1983 action.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What about damages?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you -- do you think that any other provisions of the Communications Act are enforceable under 1983? I mean, we're talking about 332, but it's a big, complicated act. Are any of the other provisions enforceable?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think -- I think the same rule would apply to any of the provisions where Congress has specifically provided for a cause of action for the same reason, otherwise Congress when -- here, for example, just to return to attorney's fees for a second. When Congress was framing this legislation, they knew that they weren't giving attorney's fees and this 332(c)(7)(B)(v) would be construed not to give attorney's fees, but not --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, this is really a more general proposition you're urging upon us then, that whenever Congress creates a cause of action that is -- what -- in any respect more limited than section 1983, the background action of section 1983 is not available.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- I -- I think that's correct.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5126 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. How could that be? Wouldn't it depend on whether -- when you look at the particular statute, the particular set of remedies that Congress has included in that statute could be absolutely independent of 1983 or dependent upon 1983 or leaning in favor or leaning against. It would depend on the particular statute. Why in general?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5127 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think in -- I think the rule would be in general because, first of all, it's not just remedies. There's other incidents of a cause of action such as statute of limitations, the provision here for expedition, and other things. And really when Congress has given thought to what remedy it wants for a violation here of (i) through (iv), for a violation elsewhere in the Communications Act of other Federal standards, it shouldn't be assumed that they all -- that -- to allow a 1983 action would just frustrate Congress' intent in fashioning that particular remedy.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5128 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then how would you ever have a statute that -- 1983 provides for relief when there's a violation of Federal law, statutory or constitutional. One of the briefs in this very case says that your broad reading means that you were doing away with statute as a basis for 1983.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5129 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I think that that's completely wrong. When Congress has created -- has recognized a right, as this Court has found is essential for a 1983 action, and it hasn't done anything about providing a remedy for that right, hasn't created a cause of action in court in particular, then that's the function of 1983, is to serve -- it provides a cause of action for people who suffer a violation of that wrong, a statutory violation. But where Congress has given thought to what kind of a relief it wanted and it said we want a cause of action with these such-and-such incidents, no attorney's fees, 30-day statute of limitations, expedition, whatever the other ones are here, then it would just frustrate Congress' intent to say, oh, and also you get a 1983 action to undo all of the things that Congress provided for.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5130 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there -- there are two situations. I mean, one can supplement without frustrating. I mean, you -- you could say that in, you know -- in some respects the 1983 will contradict the action that was provided, but one can conceive of a provided action that -- that grants relief which 1983 would not grant.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5131 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right. And -- and I -- whatever -- I guess the general point would be whatever remedial decisions Congress made, those should be respected, but I would add in this case it's not just -- it's a question of attorney's fees, which they would have had to -- Congress would have had to do something very unusual here, which is particularly put in this statute no -- there shall be no fee-shifting because otherwise you can always go to 1983 and get it. In fact, even if they had done that in 332(c)(7)(B)(v), respondents would still argue, well, we still have our 1983 action.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what about damages? Do -- do you take any position on whether the Communications Act provision enables damages to be collected?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't have a position on whether it does. I think there's arguments both ways. I would point out --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You think it's unnecessary to decide this case.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FELDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it is unnecessary, and in fact, I think it shows a problem with -- a reason why our view, which is if Congress creates a cause of action, that should be respected -- why that should be respected. Under other views, you have to look at the 1983 action and figure out all of its incidents. You have to look at the 332 action and figure out all of its incidents in the abstract as here, not where -- in connection with a particular claim for damages, and then see whether they're consistent with each other. I think the much better rule would be to say where Congress has created a specific cause of action, that's what it wanted, and whatever you get under that, you get. Whatever you don't get under that, you don't get. But 1983 shouldn't be used to -- to frustrate Congress' intent and give you things that that cause of action wouldn't to give you a longer statute of limitations, which would be, I think, the case here, to give you -- eliminate the provision for mandatory expedition, to have any differences in damages. Another way to put it would be under the Court's decision in Franklin, this statute gives you any appropriate relief. All that 1983 could do here -- it maybe gives you the same thing in which, as far as that goes, it doesn't matter. But all it could do otherwise would be give you inappropriate relief, i.e., relief that Congress didn't want. And instead of construing the two statutes in that way, they should be construed harmoniously and in accord with this Court's decisions which have set forth the line of cases where you have a right to get into court in Wilder -- I'm sorry -- in -- in Sea Clammers and Smith against Robinson and said there we want to take Congress' remedy, however simple or complex it is. It gives you a complete right to get into court and gives you whatever it gives you. And that should govern. And then the other line of cases, which is Wilder where -- and -- where it says -- and the Wright against Roanoke where Congress didn't give you a right to get to court -- get into court. In those cases, that's the function of 1983. The same thing would be true in -- in a number of other this Court's cases that have recognized you have a 1983 action when Congress gave you a right and didn't think at all about the remedy because that's the function that 1983 was supposed to serve. If there's no further questions.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Feldman. Mr. Waxman.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5138 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: In -- by its clear text, section 1983 promises redress for the depravation of any Federal right in any, quote, proper proceeding. And that expansive language, this Court has recognized, dictates a heavy presumption that its remedies apply to all violations of Federal rights, a presumption which this Court has said is rebutted only in the, quote, exceptional case in which the statute that creates the right is accompanied by an enforcement scheme that is, quote, incompatible with or inconsistent with 1983's remedies. That's --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the background principle.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman, it seems to me that the -- the best argument we've heard about incompatibility is the one -- or at least I think the best -- is the one that Mr. Lamken touched on at the tail end of his argument, and that is, he said there's -- there's a 30-day provision in there, which in effect says Congress wants this litigation conducted fast and over with fast. And that is incompatible with a damage action because if you get into a damage action, you are going to get into the panoply of -- of damages litigation, including depositions, and -- and the one thing you can guarantee is that it is not going to be over expeditiously. What is your argument? What is your response to that incompatibility argument?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think that the way this Court has interpreted incompatibility before -- in the two instances in 25 years since Maine v. Thiboutot was decided, the only instances in which this Court has found incompatibility has been where use of 1983 would create an end run around limitations in the statute. That is, in the -- in Sea Clammers and in Smith v. Robinson, you had statutes that forestalled an individual's access to court via an administrative regime and then expressly limited the judicial remedies that would be available once they got there by requiring, for example, only injunctive relief.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the other word is inconsistent, and is it -- sorry. Were you -- is it inconsistent if Congress didn't want it? And if that's insufficient to be inconsistent, then here, as I look at the statute, to get out my thinking, I think that it sounds like an administrative law statute. If I saw the maintenance and cure words, I'd think it was an admiralty statute.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5144 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. I --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5145 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I see an administrative law statute. It sounds like that's the system they're imposing and therefore a system that is not consistent with the administrative law system fails and 1983 seems to fail.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. Now I have two points. I -- I don't want to forget these. I have to deal with the -- the question of whether a 30-day requirement is inconsistent and whether damages would be inconsistent with what -- with what my colleagues posit as an APA-like administrative review model. A 30-day requirement is simply a reflection of Congress' -- Congress confirming expressly that somebody who -- who is aggrieved under the rights provided to him under 332(c)(7) and wants any judicial remedy, whether it's from 1983 or otherwise, has to go to court promptly. It's precisely what 1983, this Court said in Patsy and Felder, guarantees and requires. It does not require --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it also requires expeditiousness on the part of the court.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It requires that the court proceed expeditiously and courts can proceed expeditiously where damages are sought or are not sought. One of the interesting things about damages --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But do you -- do you agree with this much, that if -- if damages, in fact, are going to be allowed, what is going to count as expeditious is going to be a lot slower than what is going to count as expeditious if damages are not allowed.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think that's true. In fact, I think this case is a pretty good example. The court separated it -- I mean, acting under a requirement of expedition at the request of the city. This -- the court didn't even begin to address this case until 18 months after it had been filed. But what it said was --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. And -- and that --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the first issue --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that was a violation of the statute, wasn't it?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it first issued an order saying, okay, I've construed the statute and I've determined that the statute is violated. Now we will have a separate proceeding. Then the city will conduct itself accordingly. Now we'll have a separate proceeding in order to determine whether damages or attorney's fees are available. And that is available in any of these cases. What --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So they turned the damage issue basically just into a separate remedial hearing at the end of the case.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It could or could not be, and there may -- may be many cases when damages aren't appropriate but --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought that was just to decide in -- in the -- in the court of first instance -- that tail end was not to decide whether in this specific case damages or attorney's fees were due. But the district court was deciding a question of law, that is, whether in this kind of review proceeding anyone could have damages, anyone could have attorney's fees.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What he said, Justice Ginsburg, was we'll deal with what other remedies, if any, are available and to what extent in a separate proceeding. As it turns out, he concluded in an --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But was not making a rule for this case only. He was making a ruling of law.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ For sure. He said that I don't think you're entitled to this because I think that the statute doesn't allow it. And therefore, he didn't get to this question. But the point about damages -- I think there are two points that are very important that not be obscured. First of all, the Government -- the fact that the Government and the petitioner can't agree on whether the statute itself provides damages relief under the principle of Bell v. Hood and Franklin v. Gwinnett County certainly shows that Congress did not speak expressly on this subject.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They -- they don't necessarily disagree. The Government just says the -- the issue doesn't have to be reached in this case.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think -- I think that -- what the Government says in its papers is they may well be available and what Mr. Feldman -- I don't want to misquote him, but he said that under Franklin -- he agreed, I think, with what Judge Posner wrote for the Seventh Circuit, which is where no remedies -- where no specific remedies are specified -- and that's the case here -- you apply a rule of judicial implication, announced in Bell v. Hood and applied to an implied right of action in Franklin, to apply that all appropriate relief is available. And damages are the paradigm.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the irony here --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman, how do you -- how do you get a reading of the 30-day limitation, which is applicable to the cause of action under the Communications Act, sucked into the cause of action under section 1983? I mean, if the suit is under 1983, it's under 1983. There's no 30-day limit there.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I have -- I have two different ways to get to that. First of all, section 1983, by its terms, provides redress in any appropriate cause of action. It also supplies a cause of action where no other cause of action is available, but by its express terms, it doesn't exclusively limit its remedies to causes of action that are brought under 1983.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it doesn't.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But more broadly --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't require you to -- to establish a cause of action under some other statute either.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. It provides a --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does not at all. It's -- it's self-contained. And do you know any case where we have read into, or indeed, it's even been urged upon us to read into, section 1983 limitations that somehow come from the statute that was violated and which forms the basis for the 1983 action?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't, but I do know that this Court -- first of all, Congress has now enacted section 1658 which provides a -- a 4-year Federal default statute of limitations, where -- where a statute like 1983 doesn't provide it, but includes an -- an introduction that says, except where otherwise provided by Federal law. And there's certainly nothing in that language that says when you're looking at whether a statute of limitations is otherwise provided by Federal law, you look to the very statute that creates the substantive right that 1983 is enforcing. And even before that, when your -- your decision in Wilson v. Garcia made the point that when you try to figure out what statute of limitations applies to a freestanding 1983 action, there are -- there is a tripartite rule of construction that section 1988 requires you to engage in. And the first part is to see whether there is any, quote, suitable Federal statute of limitations. Now, in constitutional cases, like the one that was at issue in Wilson v. Garcia or under the Social Security Act, which is what was addressed in Maine v. Thiboutot, there were no express causes of action, much less any express statute of limitations. And so this Court said you then go to the second rule, which is what's the most appropriate State limitations, as 1988 requires. But the anomaly of the argument here is we have a background principle that 1983 is available and there is a heavy presumption that it will be available unless it is explicitly incompatible or inconsistent with --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that's why I'm approaching it differently, and I -- I want to get your view on it. I'm taking the word inconsistent and I'm using that as a guide back into the purpose of the statute. And once I do that, I find Congress here anxious, I think, to engage in what I'd call cooperative federalism. They could have run the whole show, but they said we don't want the FCC. We want each city and town to do what they want, subject to a few minimal procedural requirements. If that's right, that means all these damages questions are open. All kinds of things are open, but -- and we'll decide them in a variety of ways, maybe deferring to the State, but one thing is true: 1983 doesn't apply because that is a different set of remedies.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, this is not the APA model. This is not a model of administrative review for a number of reasons. Number one, it is a background -- there -- there -- it is established, for purposes of this case, that this statute creates individual Federal rights and those rights were violated. And the background rule is uniformly -- and this Court has -- has -- in Owens v. City of Indianapolis and many other cases has reinforced the principle that damages are available and 1983 is available where Federal rights are violated by municipalities, whether it's under the Takings Clause or the Due Process Clause or the Equal Protection Clause or in statutory cases. What is more --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman -- Mr. Waxman, one of these provisions gives you an option to go to the FCC, the one having to do with emissions. Now, if you sought review from the local decision to the FCC, you petition for FCC relief, would the FCC have authority to give you attorney's fees?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The FCC has said that it does not if you do that. In -- in 2000, when the FCC last reported, one person had chosen to go that route rather than go to Federal court. It --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, isn't that an incongruity that Congress would say you have your choice? Complainant, you can go to the Federal agency, the FCC, or you can go to court.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You can't go to the -- excuse me. I didn't --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So if -- if you have that choice, when you're dealing with the radio emissions, to go the -- why would any litigant ever do that? Why would any attorney ever do that if you don't get fees at the FCC and you do get fees in court? Wouldn't the presumption be that it would work the same way whether you go to the agency, Federal agency, or Federal or State court, that you're in the same situation as respect to fees?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the FCC alternative for a declaration by the FCC applies to only one of the five rights that are provided here, and even if it applied to all of them, I don't think you could possibly infer that --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let's take the one, that -- that one. Are you saying no attorney's fees there because you couldn't get them at the FCC, therefore you shouldn't get them in court?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely not. If -- if there were an instance in which a local zoning official said, you know, I know I'm not supposed to take radio frequencies emissions into account, but I'm going to, it's denied, I would have the right either to go to the FCC and say, tell them no, or to file an action under 332 and/or 1983 and say that violates my rights. And actually your example --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But isn't --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I just may finish. Your example, I think -- the example of this particular provision points out that what -- the balance of what I was going to explain to Justice Breyer, which is that another reason why this isn't the APA model is that this statute includes in little (i) and little (ii) substantive provisions, not just procedural provisions. You can't discriminate, to give Justice O'Connor's first example, among providers. The -- that was a complaint in this case. There is de novo review, it is clear, on those claims. It's not administrative APA review in any respect. And in fact, the district judge in this very case, Judge Wilson, says it looks like, in fact, you were discriminated against, but I don't need to reach that because it's clear that there was no substantial evidence.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They -- they didn't provide for the normal administrative review because they were quite aware that under the State zoning systems, there would always be State administrative review before the issue even comes up.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And this --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And so what this provides is what kind of judicial review there will be after the anticipated administrative review before the zoning board and whatever appeal from the zoning board exists.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I have to respectfully disagree. This Court, in -- in Williamson County and Darby and many other cases, has distinguished carefully between final -- final action and exhaustion of administrative review or judicial review. And all this statute requires is that if you are aggrieved by an action or inaction of a State or local government or an instrumentality thereof --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Final. Final action or failure to act is what --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Final action or failure to.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And final action, this Court has explained, does not import into it exhaustion of either a State administrative or judicial remedies. What it means is that once you have been injured, it's a -- it's a ripeness requirement that's familiar under --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You haven't been injured until you've exhausted your --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- you really think that when there is a State provision available for review of the zoning board, you can commence an action under 1983 without even going through the administrative appeals?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I am entirely certain of that, and in fact, the -- the local ordinance -- I mean, the question of what is final agency action is surely a Federal question, but --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is really respecting the States, which is what the -- the purpose of this -- of this whole provision was.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, when Congress addressed this problem in 1996, as the Government points out in the very first page of its brief and as the legislative history reflects, it was confronting a situation in which intransigent, entrenched zoning authorities were acting arbitrarily to frustrate the creation of a national wireless network. And it was so concerned about this that the House actually passed a provision that removed this paradigmatic local authority to the FCC. The FCC was --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which would be more burdensome? That enactment or subjecting municipalities nationwide to damages? Which would be more intrusive and burdensome on federalism --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and the abilities of local governments to function?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, I think the former, for sure. I mean, the notion that zoning decisions, siting decisions would be removed entirely from localities is unbelievably intrusive. And what happened in the conference committee was a compromise was reached whereby Congress' objective was going to be achieved by creating -- by leaving it, in the first instance, Justice Kennedy, to local --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm -- I'm not so sure because you're arguing that even the smallest municipality can be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars of attorney's fees.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- let me just say this, with respect to the --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Plus other -- plus other damages.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think this case, Justice Kennedy -- I have three things to say about this. Just this case is every bit as -- as paradigmatic as the parade of horribles that they suggest. And here's my proof. It has been since 1997 that courts have been ruling that 1983 and damages are available under this statute. There is no evidence in any of the briefs on the other side or any of their amici that there has either been a flood of litigation or inappropriately large awards. And if that happened, Congress would do -- would be attentive to it in the way that Justice Ginsburg pointed out when the local cable authorities came to -- came to the very same committees 4 years before and said, we're being hit -- there's an express right of action in 555 of the -- the Communications Act. We're being hit with very large 1983 awards. Please do something about it. And the very same committees 4 years before enacted a provision that said you may get only injunctive and declaratory relief, thereby creating an incompatibility with 1983, as the legislative history expressly provides.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, cable -- cable media companies may -- may have Congress' ear more readily than -- than -- you know, than the municipality of whatever this is or any --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ State and -- than State and local governments? I hope not. But here's -- here's the additional --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I -- I wouldn't put a lot of money on it. (Laughter.)
03-1601 +++$+++ 5214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The point is that Congress -- Justice Kennedy, the point is not that Congress was being inattentive to State and local budgets. What it wanted to do what was this -- the point this Court the addressed in -- in Stakura and -- and Owens v. City of Indianapolis, which is to enforce a Federal statute through privately enforceable Federal rights, which would include a damages remedy that both provides a deterrent against conduct that had provided entrenched resistance to a Federal program and provide compensation where reasonable and appropriate. Now, this Court has made clear, with respect to damages, in -- in Carey v. Piphus and other cases, that there may be very many cases in which there's a violation of a procedural right but only nominal damages are available. And in Buckhannon --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But with respect to --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I may just finish this sentence. And in Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, this Court has -- has recognized that in order to get attorney's fees, you have to have substantially prevailed and a court, under 1988(b), may award attorney's fees in its -- may award -- in its discretion insofar as they are reasonable. And --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. -- Mr. Waxman.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Justice Ginsburg.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is in this legislative record a concern expressed by a Senator from California when there was a proposal on the table to make the FCC the Federal review forum. And that was rejected, if I understand correctly, because there was a concern that municipalities would have to travel all the way to Washington, D.C. to defend in the FCC's forum. And Congress did not want to saddle municipalities with the cost of transporting their representative to D.C. Well, that cost would pale compared to attorney's fees that would be awarded.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ First of all, Justice Ginsburg, I -- the reference to those two Senators -- what those two Senators were talking about is not, as my colleague's brief suggests, this provision. They were talking about another provision of the Telecom Act. I think it was section 253, but I may be wrong. But even if that's the case, the fact of the matter is that whether it was going to cost them -- I agree. It would cost -- look, a regime in -- which left all of these siting decisions to the FCC is breathtaking, and it certainly would impose lots of costs not only on local municipalities to have to come to Washington to justify these decisions, but certainly on the FCC, which would have to send an army out to example -- I mean, it would sort of like be the -- the television commercial, you know, where the guy is walking around saying, you know, can you hear me now, can you hear me now? The fact is it made great sense to continue to leave the initial decisions with local authorities. But Congress had -- was frustrated, expressly frustrated with the fact that the prior regime, in which they had let local authorities do it under their normal routines and applying the normal remedies, was not getting the job done. That was the imperative of this statute. And in the -- in the absence of any evidence, even now 11 years later -- or I guess it's 10 years -- 9 years later. In the absence of any evidence of a flood of litigation or inappropriate awards, I think given the very heavy presumption that this Court has recognized over and over and over again, that 1983 is there.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That isn't the only --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ 1983 is the background principle against which Congress legislates. And this statute either -- neither provides nor excludes any remedies, and all it does is confirm that when you go -- when you are injured, you can go to court. And --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The other -- the other harm is there any evidence of because it's -- it would also be harmful if local zoning boards, when faced with quite difficult decisions, because the -- the antenna -- they bristle up and you put them in the wrong place. They're environmentally harmful. They -- there are a lot of bad things, as well as good things about them. And of course, it would be a bad impact if we discovered that the zoning boards were erring too much on the side of granting everybody's application, as well as too much on the side of not granting them.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To be sure.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And so I -- I don't know how -- what the -- there won't be evidence. How can we get evidence on such a thing?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the -- you -- the evidence will be either in the decided cases or by local municipal governments coming to Congress and saying, this is too heavy a thumb on the scale. But what we know is that if you afford only prospective relief, which is the -- the ancien regime that Congress was -- that Congress felt wasn't doing the job, it provides no deterrent, no incentive to accomplish what Congress said was --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I -- I don't think we --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- a compelling national objective.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think we usually think of -- of judicial review of agency decisions in the ordinary course as being a deterrent.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's an opportunity to elaborate reasons. It's a safeguard. It's not a deterrent. And you're saying it has to be a deterrent. And as Justice Breyer indicates, it -- it means that there's -- there's another voice in that -- in that administrative hearing room. They're terrified of damages.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Kennedy --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it's going to skew the decisions.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, it -- under their -- under the regulations of this municipality, which is -- is perfectly representative, it is final agency action when the city planning commissioner says no, unless you choose to appeal it to the city council. And there is -- not only is there nothing peculiar about applying 1983 damages awards to the violation by a State and local government of an express Federal right, assuming you can prove not only that the right was violated but also that you were really damaged. It's -- I'm not suggesting that -- that Congress had damages in mind specifically and only to deter conduct. You have said in a variety of instances -- I mentioned Stacura in particular -- that 1983 damages do serve as a deterrent to violation of Federal rights by municipal local officials. But what Congress had -- Congress had to come up with some way to confront this problem in which there were sort of local parochial --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask this question, Mr. Waxman? I don't know if it's really a legal question exactly, but I have the impression that most of the plaintiffs in this type of litigation are well-financed, large companies rather than the typical 1983 plaintiff. And therefore, you don't need the attorney's fee incentive to be sure these rights are protected. Is that a correct impression or is it incorrect?
03-1601 +++$+++ 5236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I don't know whether it's a correct impression or not. Our brief points the Court to an authority that at least 9,500 of the entities that have -- have created antennas or tower facilities have 10 or fewer facilities. And one thing we know for sure is that when Congress enacted the Telecom Act of 1996, it specifically wanted to encourage small operations, start-up companies. It had specific provisions in the law to give special treatment to small entrepreneurs in order to foster diversity and competition. But in the event that you --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I can't imagine -- I can't imagine, Mr. Waxman, that Congress wanted to impose damages plus attorney's fees upon municipalities without even giving the municipalities the chance to correct their mistakes, which is what you're saying.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're saying the municipalities' appeal system, which is there for people to take advantage of, is just washed out. One mistake at the lowest level and you get damages and you get attorney's fees. That -- that is extraordinary.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, the -- the -- 1983 -- and your jurisprudence shouts this as clearly as it does any other principle -- stands for the proposition that it's there unless, in the explicit language of the statute that creates the right, there is a demonstrated incompatibility. And that's the background rule. There are many instances in the Telecom Act and elsewhere in which Congress has said you can only get injunctive relief. You may not get 1983 damages. I mean, go back to Adickes v. Kress where this Court said in title II of the Public Accommodations Act, Congress expressly -- expressly precluded damages in order to avoid invocation of 1983. And I'm not saying that Congress had in mind my client, who is an individual, a sole entrepreneur, who was subject to, I think what the record shows is, prolonged and entrenched intransigence by this particular municipality, any more than it had Judge Posner's example in the Seventh Circuit where it was, you know, Verizon v. the Village of Mequon. But this Court has recognized, as have the lower courts, that you only get damages if you prove that you really have been damaged. And in an instance where there's some procedural violation and a remand to correct it, this may very well be the instance of Carey v. Piphus, where the damages are purely nominal. The agency is given the opportunity. In this case, the city never said, give us the opportunity to go back and correct it. And Judge Wilson, a very level-headed district judge, said there's nothing to go back and correct because the only thing -- the only reason that the city gave was it didn't like this antenna and tower in the first place. It -- we concede that it makes no difference to anybody which frequencies are being broadcast from this tower that we approved 10 years ago and have no right to modify. And therefore, there was a substantive violation, not just, you know, you -- you may have had substantial evidence but you didn't lay it all out or you gave your reasons at length and orally but not in writing, I'll give you the opportunity to go back. There's a line of cases this Court has decided under the Social Security Act where there have been remands to correct procedural errors or small errors, and in those instances, Carey v. Piphus says you don't get damages. And under Buckhannon and Farrar v. Hobby, you probably don't get attorney's fees either. If there ever is the sort of parade of horribles that they protest about, even a small parade of horribles, Congress will be as attentive as it was in 1992 when the cable --
03-1601 +++$+++ 5241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Waxman.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Lamken, you have about 4 minutes left.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5245 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. LAMKEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'd like to make only two brief points. First, that the imposition of the -- of damages and fees under section 1983 from a decision in this Court for even good faith mistakes in the implementation of the antenna siting rules, which are often complex and uncertain, would be a welcome mat for extensive and aggressive litigation and the imposition of extensive fees on municipalities which simply cannot afford to enforce their zoning rules, the rules that Congress expressly attempted to preserve in the statute itself. It is -- in this case alone, for example, respondent's most recent estimate of his damages and fees -- and this was before he retained Mr. Waxman, I might add -- is -- is $15 million, essentially the city's entire budget for a year. And respondent claims to be a relatively small operator. That sort of -- with that sort of liability in an uncertain area of law, very few municipalities could ever afford to stand on their rights to enforce local zoning even when they're relatively certain that they are right. Section 332(c)(7) is entitled and has one of its purposes as the preservation of local authority. It should not be construed to provide for that authority's evisceration. The second point I wanted to hit is that when Congress established the mechanism for review in 332, it provided a very adapted mechanism with an unusual pair of characteristics: a very short limitations period and mandatory expedition. This Court's decisions in Novotny makes it clear that neither of those requirements can be simply transferred over to section 1983. Novotny had very similar language, a 90-day limitations period. The Court did not transfer that over to section 1983. Instead it understood that the general rule, the general Federal principle of law, that in the absence of an express limitations period, that State law would control. Wilson then confirms that rule, as an interpretation of section 1988, that the governing Federal principle is that State law controls unless there's an express Federal cause of -- statute that addresses that particular cause of action. If there are no further questions, we ask only that the judgment of the Ninth Circuit be reversed. Thank you.
03-1601 +++$+++ 5246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Lamken. The case is submitted.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5250 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ And we will now hear argument in McCreary County against the ACLU. Mr. Staver?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5252 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens and may it please the Court. Before this Court is a setting of law in a courthouse and a display on law that contains the universally recognized symbol of law. Despite the fact that the deck law occupies only one tenth of this otherwise secular display, the Sixth Circuit struck it down. The Court focused solely on the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments and that's aired by ignoring the overall context. The Ten Commandments is unlike most any other acknowledgment. It is in a category essentially all by itself. It is thematic in common places in courthouses while Nativity scenes and menorahs occur occasionally and often gratuitously on public property. The Ten Commandments occurs quite frequently and has for more than a century in courthouses all over this nation. It is associated with courthouses for a clear historic reason, because the Ten Commandments has played an influential role in American law and government and our system of law in this country. The context in this case is clearly important. Yet the Sixth Circuit --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask you there basically to comment on the point that Justice Scalia made in the course of the last argument? The context, as we know, has changed pretty radically in the course of litigation over this and it started out with just the Ten Commandments alone and then version 2, the Ten Commandments had certain -- were surrounded by certain quotations of religious content from other texts. And finally, as I guess literally is true with a new lawyer and more litigation, we've gotten to the present context. Isn't the problem that you have to face, as I've said before, what Justice Scalia raised before, everybody knows what's going on. Everybody knows that the present context is simply litigation dressing and that the object for what is going on is the object that was revealed in the first place. What is your response to that?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Several. The display in this case has three different phases. First it was the stand-alone Ten Commandments. They were sued. They could have defended that but they chose instead to switch rather than fight because they wanted to try to comply with this Court's establishment clause jurisprudence, to try to figure out how to be able to display this particular document. They stepped, however, on a land mine admittedly with this second display.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they created the land mine basically. I mean --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They were trying to do the best that they could, trying to follow this ever bending establishment clause jurisprudence especially in the area of displays. Remember this was back in 1999. At that time, there were less than a handful of reported decisions ever in this country on the Ten Commandments. The first was in 1973, Stone was in 1980 and there were a couple of others. There are only 30 reported cases in the country or so and 23 of those happened from 1999 to the present so they didn't have really any guidance. They were trying to follow Lynch and Allegheny as best as they could but these are governmental officials. They're not jurists schooled in the law. And admittedly they made a mistake. But what they have now is the foundation is display and as the District Court recognized, it is fundamentally different than any previous display. Like this Court's decision in the Sunday law cases, even though it may have started off for a religious purpose, the Sunday laws were continued to be retained for secular reasons. In this case --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are you saying that the purpose is neutral or that the purpose doesn't matter?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We're saying that in this case, the purpose is about the display of law. We also have an argument later on that this Court should reconsider the purpose in generally as it relates to the Lemon test.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, but if we still have a purpose inquiry, what you say of course is true. The current display includes the display of a lot of legal documents. But is there any reason for anyone to believe that that display of legal documents or anything else would be there for any other purpose than the display of the Ten Commandments, including the religious, the overtly theistic part of the text?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. The District Court actually recognized that one of the omni intended effects of the history is to educate everyone of the difference between an acknowledgment and an establishment. And even if they had a religious purpose under the second display, that religious purpose has been buried and has been abandoned. They voluntarily accepted the --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're not abandoning the position that you have a right to make this kind of religious display, are you?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, we're not.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that's why we said that they could have defended the individual first display which was the Ten Commandments alone, in part because it is the uniquely recognized historic symbol of law and is commonplace and thematic in the courthouse. They could have defended when they were originally sued on that basis alone but instead they chose to modify the display. And when they modified the display, it had excerpted sections around it.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But is there -- I guess -- I don't want to tie you up too long but I mean given the history, isn't it still the case that there is no serious reason to believe that there is any object here other than the display of the Ten Commandments including the overtly theistic text and the rest of this is basically enabling context which does not affect the objective, the objective being the Ten Commandments and the religious text?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, they must be able to change their misstep, if it was a misstep, that they had. Otherwise, that past case would be superimposed on the foundation's display forever and the question would be --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, not forever but for now. This isn't a case in which they came up with the Ten Commandments display, it got enjoined and 10 years later somebody comes along and says, let's have a display of important documents in the history of law. This in fact is a continuous process and it is a continuous process within the context of litigation about the constitutionality of the display. It's not a -- the implication is not that you can never have a different display but that there is no reason to believe that the intent of this display has changed as the context has changed. What is your response to that?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The intent has certainly broadened in this case and there is clearly no evidence in this record that this foundations display is solely purposed or intended to be a religious display. In fact, even the respondents of amici that wrote against us said that on the face of this display, it appears secular in nature. It does. In fact, the foundations display not only has numerous other documents of which the Ten Commandments is only one tenth of these many other document but it also has a foundations document that says what the purpose is about. There is only two places that talk about the purpose on the foundations display. On the document itself, which says it's a display about some documents that influenced American law and government, and the undisputed testimony that these are documents that reflect documents that have influenced American law and government. That's the record before this Court on the foundations display and that is fundamentally different --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose we go back to the first display. If all that was there was the Ten Commandments, now, in your opinion, was that constitutional?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is arguably constitutional --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do we take it along with the resolution of the counties? Do we look at everything?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, there was no resolution, Justice O'Connor, for the first display. It just went up.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So just that first display, what was the purpose of that first one?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The purpose of that first one is like it is in many courthouses around the country. Both courthouses have numerous documents of his historical nature along the walls,284 just in the curia alone. And in Pulaski, many, many documents, when they celebrated their 200th anniversary in 1999. So that was one of many documents that's there and that was a document of the Ten Commandments that was meant to show the historic nature of the Ten Commandments, how it has in fact influenced American law and government in the appropriate setting of a courthouse.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The original one?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The original one.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was there anything there that said we're interested in history and what we're not interested in is having this on the wall as -- to encourage people to study the Bible and to encourage them to study religion and to understand that in their lives, religion should be important and this very solemn secular setting. Nonetheless, religion is important. Is there anything like that on the document itself?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, it was just the document itself in a frame on a wall amongst almost 300 other documents.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What if its purpose were to demonstrate -- and I quote from one of our earlier opinions -- that we are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. What if that were its purpose? Would that have made it bad?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't believe so, Justice Scalia, because that in fact is an acknowledgement that is part of our history; like in Marsh versus Chambers. That's why this Court has authorized prayers before legislative sessions or suggested that the national motto is constitutional because indeed we are a religious people as this Court has said more than five times. We are a religious people. Our institutions do presuppose the existence of a Supreme Being.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And is it your position that no real harm is inflicted on people who do not agree with that message?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor. Justice Kennedy, it would not inflict any harm because in this case, it's a passive display in a courthouse in a hallway and you could simply walk past that and avert your eyes once you see this. It inflicts no harm, it does not --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Staver, what about all the distinctions that have been made between messages that are brief or I think the expression has been minimal or minimum in some of our cases, like in God we Trust, like God save the United States and this Honorable Court, like under God, and a document that is about worshipping the Lord, at least as many words devoted to that topic. So it's not a brief reference. It's a powerful statement of the covenants that the Lord is making with his people.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the Ten Commandments is a unique symbol in the area of acknowledgment because of its historic role in influencing our law and government. It is displayed in this context for that unique role. It does have some statements in there about God but, frankly, very few when you look at the overall context.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Have you read the first four commandments and could you say that?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. And those are definitely and decidedly religious. There is no question that the Ten Commandments is a religious document. There is also no question that it has influenced our American law.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think the Ten Commandments are longer than the legislative prayers you've heard at the beginning of congressional sessions?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Scalia. I think they're quite shorter.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know how much help I can get or not but I was thinking in terms of the involvement of the government, is the government involved in religion when it posts the Ten Commandments alone? Yes, of course it is. Now, there could be a purpose to it, that they want to just show the history of law but it's all by itself and there is a lot more history than that and context may matter a lot. Not everybody will go with the Ten Commandments just by itself there and say, well, gee, this seems to go too far. This is going too far. Why? Because it isn't really related to history, it's the only thing up there, it's involvement in religion, so forth. Now, suppose I go down that track because what I'm really looking for is a key as to what's too far and what's not. But for present purposes, let's assume it's too far. Now, once they've gone too far there, the next thing that happens is they keep changing it but they change it pursuant to the resolution and it seems as if in context, all they've tried to do is to surround what went too far with a number of other things that would somehow make it legal. Now, if it was wrong to begin with, is it wrong to end with?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Breyer, it is not wrong to end with any more than it would be wrong to begin with the Sunday laws based upon the Sabbath commandment which was a commandment about worship and the end with the secular reason for keeping those particular laws as this Court has recognized in McGowan. And in this case, even if they started off with a decidedly and only religious purpose, which we contend they did not, they did not end with one and they've got to, as governmental officials, be able to adjust their missteps whenever they step on a constitutional land mine that is sometimes blurry and confusing to them. That's what they tried to do in this case, the best efforts to try to follow this Court's decision when there was really no specific guidelines for them to be guiding their direction. The Ten Commandments that Justice Stevens, you had mentioned about the versions, the versions I don't believe, with all due respect, are relevant in this case or any other case regarding the Ten Commandments because if that were the case, you wouldn't be able to teach the Bible in an appropriate context because there are so many different versions and yet Stone and Schempp has indicated that you indeed can teach even the Biblical text with all of its multiple versions.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I assume if you were running a course in a school about the biblical text, you would explain the differences. You would indicate the difference between the Jewish, the Roman, the Protestant, the Lutheran and so on and you're not doing that here. I would have thought your answer might be, well, if that really made a difference, we could have separate versions. But it's not comparable to school teaching.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Souter, it would in fact be somewhat comparable because if you're teaching general biblical text, you wouldn't have all the versions lined out.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would you think it was appropriate in a public school course that was otherwise a bona fide course to teach the day on exodus, to teach about simply the Protestant version of the Ten Commandments?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We would believe that, in fact, in this case, I don't even think they thought about whether there were different versions but we certainly believe that they could have the text there and talk about the Ten Commandments.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In a public school, wouldn't it be required, at least for intellectual reasons if not the reasons of the establishment clause to say, well, graven images are dealt with differently in the standard Roman translation and the preamble sections of what may and may not be regarded as commandment number 1 are different in the Christian versus Jewish and so on. Wouldn't that be an intellectually responsible requirement?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's in a school context which this is a courthouse context.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Exactly. I thought you were equating the two together.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not one to one but I think the version issue, if there is a version that flunks the test, it would be this Court's south frieze. It's actually in Hebrew and it speaks only to Jewish people. But yet that's not sectarian such that it violates the establishment clause. That's the acknowledgment as opposed to an establishment. Justice Stevens, if you would like, I would like to reserve the remaining of my time.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, you may do so. Mr. Clement, you're welcome to stand up for a second time.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5301 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court. The display of historical documents here, like the display in the Lynch against Donnelly case of the creche, may include a religious item without running afoul of the establishment clause. As in the --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do we have to consider the history of the display at all?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice O'Connor, we would urge you not to consider the history of the display. You in your concurring opinion in the Pinette case made the point that in the context of accommodations, the inquiry into religious purpose doesn't make a lot of sense and you urged the Court to drop it in that context. I think so too in the acknowledgment context. Certainly if you have a situation where you don't have -- I think in the acknowledgment context as well, a focus on purpose may not be that productive. But I would like to talk about the purpose --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Souter, I have two points in response. First of all, what I think would be a crazy way of having a jurisprudence is for the Court to say that this display is a foundation to the law document, it's perfectly constitutional in every other county courthouse in Kentucky except for McCreary County and Pulaski County because of their prior conduct. The second point that I think is important in this context is that I think this Court's establishment clause jurisprudence is already difficult enough to apply without creating the First Amendment equivalent of covered jurisdictions under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Basically, and I think I understand you, you're saying, and I think you said it earlier, drop the intent clause and basically have a -- try to move toward an objective criterion saying there are some ways you can display religious things and some ways perhaps that you can't and try to develop that kind of objective jurisprudence as distinct from an intent jurisprudence. That's your point, isn't it?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That would be my point, Justice Souter, but I also think independent of that point, it is also not a particular productive jurisprudence to really treat different municipalities differently because the mayor in one case may have started with the creche and decided to add the wishing well or in the other case started the wishing well and added the creche. I don't think it makes any sense that if they end up in the same place, the constitutional rules could be the same.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Clement, you placed heavy reliance on Marsh, which was prayer and it was undisguised and it was permitted to have since the beginning of our nation. Would it be equally compatible with the establishment clause if this Court opened its daily sessions with prayer?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I'm not sure that I could the jurisprudence that said this Court could not open its sessions with a prayer but the Capitol can. Now, if there was any difference drawn at all, I would assume it would be a difference based on history.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not sure we don't deal with it. I don't know who we're addressing when we say God save the United States and this Honorable Court.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The kind of prayer that is used to open the legislative sessions which this Court has distinguished from in God we trust, God save the United States and this Honorable Court.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And as I said, Justice Ginsburg, I think if there were a difference in principle, it would have to be a difference based on history. But I don't think there is -- in this context, I think it is fair to say --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm asking you what your view is of the compatibility of every federal Court in the country having over the bench a replica of the Ten Commandments and opening each session with prayer.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I suppose if the federal courts decided to do that, we would probably try to defend them on establishment clause grounds. I don't think, though, that -- I think that would obviously be a much tougher case than the posting of the Ten Commandments in the outer hallway along with a variety of other documents which I take it to be the first case here. And then the final display that the Court has before it is actually the Ten Commandments in the context of the other secular historical documents. And I think that kind of display clearly is constitutional for the reasons that the display was constitutional in the Lynch case.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think we have to amend the Lemon test to reach your approach?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice O'Connor, this Court on a variety of occasions has chosen to simply put Lemon to one side as opposed to overtly amending it.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think, then, we have to either put it aside or amend it?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I don't, Justice O'Connor.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To decide this case?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I don't. I think it would be prudent, as I suggested at the outset, to make not necessarily a full amendment and eliminate the first purpose prong of Lemon but at least in the acknowledgment context as in the accommodation context we're not going to focus on that. But independent of that, I think many of these Court's cases that were decided even under Lemon acknowledge the principles that municipalities should be rewarded, not punished, nor trying to change their conduct to try to get things right. In Abbington against Schempp, which I think in many respects is a precursor to Lemon because it talked at least about the purpose and effects test and I gather that's about all that's left of Lemon. In that case, this Court held out the promise that it might be permissible for the government to have some use of the Bible in school. Now, when it did that, it didn't except out Abbington township and said, but not for you, Abbington township, because you violated the purpose prong. The Sixth Circuit here has adopted a rule that once mistaken, always condemned and we don't think that has any proper place in this Court's establishment of jurisprudence.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Friedman?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5325 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens and may it please the Court, three times in the course of a year, McCreary and Pulaski county posted Ten Commandments displays. They variously describe the Ten Commandments as the precedent legal code of Kentucky, the central historic legal document of the State and, finally, as the moral background of the Declaration of Independence and the foundation of our legal system. In the course of the litigation, they announced that under current law, they announced to the curt that uncurrent law, America is a Christian nation and they acknowledge that the purpose of their second display was to demonstrate America's Christian heritage. In this context, it is our position that the current courthouse display reveals both a purpose and an effect to endorse religion. This Court has repeatedly and most recently in the Santa Fe case made clear that it is necessary to look at the content, the context and the history of a display in order to gauge whether or not there is a true secular purpose or whether or not an asserted secular purpose is a sham. We submit here that on this record, the District Court and particularly in the context of an appeal from a preliminary injunction, which we have here, that the District Court had ample evidence from which it could conclude that the asserted secular purpose of McCreary and Pulaski counties was indeed a sham. The counties announced their purpose not only in the content of the display itself but in the resolution that the counties enacted, the identical resolutions that the counties enacted within weeks after the filing of this lawsuit. And in that resolution, the counties make clear that they relied on and cited approvingly the Kentucky legislature's reference to Jesus Christ as the prince of ethics. They made clear that they supported the fight of Alabama Supreme Court justice Roy Moore against the ACLU. They made absolutely clear in their legal papers that they deemed this to be a Christian nation under current law and they made clear that they absolutely intended and believed they had the right to display the Ten Commandments. They did so not in a display of history. They asserted and they intended to do so because of the religious nature of the Ten Commandments. There can be no doubt that the Ten Commandments portrays a religious point of view and is profoundly religious. The Court said so in Stone. There is no serious question about that. The question then here is whether or not the counties, in their current display, have done anything to sufficiently neutralize the endorsing message that is contained in this record. And we submit it has not done so. It now announces that the Ten Commandments are the foundation of our legal system, not just that religion is but that the Ten Commandments, a particular religious code, the word of God, it asserts is the foundation of our legal system. It asserts that the Ten Commandments, the revealed Word of God, provides the moral background of the Declaration of Independence. We think it's clear that the content of the Ten Commandments and the content of the Declaration of Independence deal with substantially different topics.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose you had a county 100 miles away or a state, a different state, and the same display was put on and the recitation was -- and it was a sincere recitation, that the government simply wanted to recognize that the 10 Commandments has played an important role in the civic lives of our people. Then you have -- they're each up for five years and five years later, some school kids wander by one and they wander by the other. In your view, from what you're telling me, the Commandments are permitted in one location and not the other? I mean, that's the necessary purport of your argument. You may not think that either of them are valid but on this prong of the argument, it seems to me that to differentiate, I just don't understand that.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think to an extent there is a differentiation because this Court has made clear that any assessment must depend on context. There is no fixed per se rule but rather, the context one must both look at the purpose and the effect. In gauging the purpose, one looks at both the litigation history, the social facts, the content and any changes. Here the District Court had not only the display itself but it had the announced purpose of the county. It therefore was in a unique position to gauge the purpose of the -- the true purpose of these counties. Moreover, it was in a unique position to gauge the effects that the reasonable observer in these small rural Kentucky counties, the reasonable observer assessment of this particular display. And the Court -- McCreary County is a county with only 17,000 people. Whitley City, the county seat, which is not even incorporated, has 1,100 people. The District Court from its chambers in London, Kentucky was well situated to gauge whether or not the reasonable observer, knowing the litigation history of this case and knowing the changes in the forum and the context of this display, would perceive this to be a neutral recitation of history or simply the third in a series of efforts by this county government to post the Ten Commandments because that is what it wanted to post.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does that mean forever? What I'm thinking -- let me spell it out. The key words in Stone would be that this was posted, the Ten Commandments, because it would lead to, in the circumstances, the students remeditate, venerate, perhaps, and obey. In other words, their reaction to it would likely be a religious reaction. Now, here if you saw it just by itself, perhaps one would be concerned with the intent or the effect of calling to the viewer's mind the sacred character of the law, which is fine for religious people to do but not necessarily fine for the State to do; and that leads them to venerate, perhaps to meditate, perhaps to consider the relationship in a religious way. If that's the problem, that would exist here only because of the history or most likely because of the history. And if that is the problem, that would dissipate over time because it is the smallness of the audience and their familiarity with the history that would likely produce the similar religious reaction to the display. Now, what's your reaction?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it's a question of degree and while over time the importance of the purpose may diminish, the purpose does not fully diminish and the effect does not change substantially. It is a question of degree, it is a question of line drawing. Here there is not an effort to incorporate the Ten Commandments into a neutral display or a neutral course of study such as a compare and contrast of ancient moral codes or a comparative religion course such as many of us have taken and schools clearly can offer. It is not a neutral display of law givers like the frieze in this Court. It asserts the primacy of the Ten Commandments. It says the Ten Commandments are the moral background of the Declaration of Independence. It doesn't say there is some commonality between the Ten Commandments and some American laws. It talks not only about law. It talks about our system of government. It says the Ten Commandments, the revealed Word of God is the moral foundation of the Declaration of Independence. That in itself is an endorsement of religion in this context and I don't think that can dissipate over time.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is it? It may be true. These pilgrims came for religious reasons. If all you have is a display of the origin of the law in the United States, what would be wrong with saying, this is a historical account? It's like teaching religion in the schools. Of course it stemmed from the religious beliefs of those who came to the United States. You don't mean it religiously. You mean it historically.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's the difference between acknowledgment and endorsement. Of course counties and other governments can acknowledge the role that religion played in history. That is very different from acknowledging religion as a general matter and asserting that a specific code that is central to specific religions is the one -- not only the one religious source but the one source, religious or moral, that provide -- religious or secular that provides the moral background of the Declaration of Independence.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't care it stands for that. As you heard, the code takes various forms for various religions. And I think all it stands for is the proposition that the moral order is ordained by God. That's all it stands for. And to say that that's the basis of the Declaration of Independence and of our institutions is entirely realistic.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What this display says --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think they're really saying that the particular commandments of the Ten Commandments are the basis of the Declaration of Independence. That's idiotic. What the commandments stand for is the direction of human affairs by God. That's what it stands for.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Whatever the merit of that statement, that is not what these counties have said. What these counties have said in their resolutions is that the Ten Commandments are the precedent legal code of Kentucky and the central historic legal document of the state. What they have said in this display itself, in the explanation of the display, that they are the moral background of the Declaration of Independence, to the exclusion of all others, in effect. When you say the, it doesn't say one of. It says it is the foundation of our legal system. It doesn't say it had an influence on some of our laws. It asserts the primacy, the actual text of this display asserts the primacy of the Ten Commandments.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that's what it means, it's idiotic. I don't think anybody is going to interpret it that way. You can't get the Declaration of Independence out of the Ten Commandments.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5337 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would agree with that, Your Honor.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5338 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I don't think that's how somebody would normally read it. I think what they're saying is the principle of laws being ordained by God is the foundation of the laws of this state and the foundation of our legal system.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How long is that resolution going to guide our view of the future displays or even the present one? What about the membership of the board of supervisors is changed? How long do we look to that particular resolution?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think, Your Honor, it's an element that the District Court in the first instance must accept and gauge in determining whether or not the announced secular purpose is indeed a true purpose or is a sham. Where we're talking about a close time period, here three displays in less than a year by the same officials of the same county trying to post the same document, this case becomes very close to the Santa Fe independent school district case where it's a moving target in direct response to pending litigation as an effort to try to get the same end result and changing the operative facts just slightly in the hope that eventually it will be right.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you a question on that point? And I should know the answer. It must be in the briefs but I don't remember. I assume that they rescinded the resolution before version 3 of the display was put up, is that correct?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is not in the record.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then I don't think we should talk about it.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The District Court was well situated to understand the social fact, historical record and arguments of both the lawyers and the parties and the statements of the parties.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Friedman, can you tell me where in the joint appendix the resolution appears?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Joint Appendix page 1, number 5, and it's Exhibit 1 attached to it. And that's the one of the counties. The other one is -- and these are the docket entries. The document itself is not in the joint appendix. And the other county is joint appendix page 28, number 6. They're both Exhibit 1s attached to those documents. Those documents are the county's motions to dismiss in the District Court.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not printed?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is not in the appendix itself, no. The resolution is not in there. The citation to it from the index is there.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is in the record which we have?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is in the record. It was submitted in fact by the petitioners in this case. They submitted the resolution in support of their arguments defending the second display, the display that surrounded the Ten Commandments with the religious text. They made clear in that brief that they were asserting their right to display the Ten Commandments as part of their argument that the purpose was to demonstrate America's Christian heritage. I submit that in that brief, in that resolution, in the repeated statements of the county officials and of their counsel, the District Court was well within its discretion to determine that the purpose here was religious, was not secular and that the effect, as viewed by the reasonable observer, was religious -- was to endorse religion, not secular. If there are additional questions, I would be happy to answer it.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The other question I have is assuming you didn't have any of this history and they started off with plan 3, would that have violated the establishment clause?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, I think it would. It would be a closer question but in this context, what we have is the assertion that the Ten Commandments are the source, the moral background of the Declaration of Independence, the foundation of our legal system. It is not incorporating the Ten Commandments as part of a neutral course of study. It is not like having Moses along with 15 other or 15 law givers. It is the assertion of the primacy of the Ten Commandments.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't understand the difference. I mean it seems to me it would violate the establishment clause, it would equally do so if you said it's a major part of or even a part of. Now, maybe it makes it wrong to say it's the exclusive one. It may make it more wrong but we're not grading papers here. It seems to me that whether it violates the establishment clause depends upon whether you're endorsing -- whether you're proselytizing religion.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that's correct, Your Honor.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What does primacy have to do with it?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it makes it an easier case when it asserts this is the one rather than one of several or one of many.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But your real position is they wouldn't have to have done that as long as they had the Ten Commandments in the display, that would be enough?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it depends on the content and context of the display.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Exactly what we've got in Exhibit 3 or whatever it is, that we don't have the statement of purposes, we don't have them saying it's the sole source of the primacy. They say it's a source. Does that still violate the establishment clause?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it does, Your Honor.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Since you have a minute, give me your opinion to the right standard if hypothetically you start with the Goldberg-Schempp idea, that the government is not absolutely forbidden by the establishment clause to recognize the religious nature of the people nor the religious origins of much of our law and so forth but it's easy to go too far and it's easy in this area you are trading on eggs to become far more divisive than you hoped and really end up with something worse than if you stayed out in the first place. In other words, it's a very delicate matter and it's very easy to offend people. Now, suppose you start with that. You're trying to define what is too far constitutionally speaking. What's your test? Of the many that have been in our opinions, which do you think works the best for that purpose or some other?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the Court's endorsement test has stood the test of time and has worked well. It allows the District Courts that are most familiar with what is actually happening to look at both the purpose and the effect of a particular display. I don't think there can be an ironclad rule. There can be presumptions. There can be brighter line tests perhaps. But I think ultimately --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Within reason outline an approach that would say a religious display is presumptively for -- is a presumptive endorsement. I think with the Baptist brief. Would you endorse that test?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We think that test can work very well in a context like this where we're talking about the display of religious texts rather than just symbols. And the point I think is well worth considering, that we assume that when people post signs or displays, bumper stickers, buttons, that they endorse the content of that text and that the presumption then would place a burden on government to make sure that it is neutralizing the endorsing effect of displaying text. I think that is a very workable text in a context like this where we're talking about the posting of core religious texts.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would you explain why you distinguish text and symbolize them? You distinguish text from the crucifix and so on. Why?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FRIEDMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does depend entirely on context, to be sure, but symbols are subject to alternative interpretation. Text is not. Or text rarely is. And text such as this, religious text, cannot be seen as anything other than the revealed Word of God. I mean, here we have 120 words in the first four Commandments, 142 in the first five Commandments of this display that is a profound, detailed explication of core religious content, core religious meaning.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understand the text part but why not adopt the same test for the symbols? For example, why not adopt it for the Moses? The burden would be on the government to show that it was not approving, endorsing, et cetera, and in this context, that would be pretty easy. Why not have the same test?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Friedman. Mr. Staver, you have about three minutes left.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5375 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, the argument before this Court was unlike anything that went down in the District Court or the Circuit Court of Appeals because never was a resolution ever mentioned. Never did the District Court or the Sixth Circuit ever discuss the resolution. It was not mentioned in this Court until this answer brief by respondents was filed. It is not part of the District Court's decision, it was not part of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The District Court said that what imprinted every action thereafter with defiance in a taint is the mere posting of the first display. There was no resolution for that display, none is needed. There is no resolution for the foundations display.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5376 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was there a resolution, Counsel?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ For the second display, yes, Your Honor, there was.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And whatever is in the record is that resolution?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is that resolution but it is specific to the second display because it specifically mentions what kind of documents are in that display. It is not a general display regarding posting of documents. In this case, when of the Court --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But is it correct that it was not amended when the third display was created?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was not amended because it was not -- it was relevant and fact-specific in the display itself.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is the last expression of the governing body's intent?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. What's the last expression is the foundations display which clearly a reasonable observer would see. And if there is any doubt regarding --
03-1693 +++$+++ 5384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there hasn't been a new resolution.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is not a new resolution.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that one wasn't rescinded?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That one died, Your Honor, with the Court's ruling.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was adopted and it still is there, presumably?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Presumably. There is nothing in the record that suggests what happened to it. Whether it was repealed or not. But it was specific factually only to that second display, not to the foundations display which the District Court found was fundamentally different. And if there is any doubt regarding the history of purpose, we would suggest, Justice O'Connor, your suggestion in the Wallace, that if there is any doubt regarding purpose, to look to the effects prong. And I think when you look to the effects prong, a reasonable observer will see that this is a constitutional display. This case is one in which the Sixth Circuit drew the most difficult hate, it imposed it in a subsequent action in the most difficult area of the establishment clause and clearly the public officials have substantially and fundamentally changed. They can't live under this taint forever. They tried but they could to correct their way. They tried what they could to display this in a constitutional manner so that anyone passing by would see this as one document among many others. In addition to the display itself, with all the other hundreds of documents that are on the wall, this display has a specific stated purpose.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So presumably these things are open if it goes on to the final hearing? The preliminary injunction stage?
03-1693 +++$+++ 5391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STAVER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, the preliminary injunction. And the fact that the resolution is technically latent on the books, they are will repeal that, they repudiate that resolution. Thank you.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. The case is submitted.
03-1693 +++$+++ 5393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CLERK OF COURT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The honorable Court is now adjourned until Monday next at 10 o'clock.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5397 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We will now hear argument in Exxon Mobil against Saudi Basic Industries. Mr. Coleman, I trust you will soon tell us why the case is not moot or whether you think it's moot, and if -- if not, why not.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5399 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Good morning, Justice Stevens. May it please the Court: I will begin with that, if you would like. This case is not moot because there is an ongoing case or controversy between the parties. There is a judgment, it is true, from the Delaware State court, which has now been affirmed by the Delaware Supreme Court. But preclusion doctrines not Rooker-Feldman and not mootness govern the resolution of the claims that we asserted first --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what financial interests do your clients have to keep litigating today in another court?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know the --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What's going on? I mean, it's very confusing.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, certainly, Justice O'Connor, we've not yet recovered on our judgment and that judgment is still there. It is still in existence. We've not yet collected on it. But I don't believe that mootness turns on whether you have, in fact, collected on a judgment. There are very few cases out there in which a party has, in fact, obtained two judgments, one from a State court and one from a Federal court, usually because a party waived the application of preclusion doctrines. And -- and we have conceded previously that that's not our interest. What is our interest here is that we have asserted Federal jurisdiction. This case was brought in Federal court by SABIC. During the course of discovery, we found some things out that they had been overcharging us and we indicated that we were going to bring claims against them in Federal court. They ran down to Delaware court by forum shopping in order to try to obtain a shorter statute of limitations, which turned out for them to be a strategic blunder of monumental proportions. But the Federal case, when we filed it, those claims had original jurisdiction in Federal court. They have not yet been resolved in a proper way. We --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But do you have a continuing case or controversy? That was -- that -- that's a bedrock Article III requirement, and if you've got all the relief that you were seeking -- let's put it this way. Suppose your opponent SABIC says, here's the check for the $417 million and we undertake that we're not going to pursue any further relief. Would you have a case or controversy left?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. We might not have an interest in pursuing the case, but we have a legal interest in terms of Article III case or controversy. It is well established that the -- the fact of taking a judgment does not make a case moot. In fact, if there were a holding that we think that the Federal case were moot --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if you've got all the relief to which you are entitled, that does make a case moot.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In terms of cases that involve injunctive relief where it is impossible for a court to give you the relief that you have -- that you are seeking, that is true. But when you are seeking money damage, it is at least theoretically possible -- we're not saying that we're going to ask for that, but at least theoretically possible that the Federal district court could still give us relief. And therefore, what we are asking for is --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What relief could it give you?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what for?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What relief? If you're paid in full, what -- what relief are you entitled to?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we think the relief that we're entitled to, in terms of this, is for the case to be remanded for the district court to resolve these issues under preclusion doctrines.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what issues would -- would the district court resolve?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Preclusion.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if you win on the preclusion --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Who cares?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- what do you get then in substance?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't necessarily intend to take a -- another judgment in Federal court.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then what do you intend to do? If you win on preclusion, what do you do then?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, hopefully we'll win on preclusion with respect not only to this suit, the New Jersey II suit, but also the New Jersey I suit, which we say the district -- or the Delaware judgment precludes.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think we'd like an answer. Justice Ginsburg gives us -- gives you a hypothetical case. You've got the money. The judgment has been discharged in the State courts. What is left to do in the Federal court?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is likely --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, the one answer I heard you give, well, we're interested in preclusion to say -- well, that's all historical at that point. Who cares?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it is likely, Your Honor -- and we have previously said -- that we may very well dismiss the case of our own accord. But that doesn't mean --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We're looking for -- we're looking for something that makes the case live.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our claims are alive. There are claims there that seek relief --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But we're -- we're questioning why that is and we're asking you what relief you need to get that you wouldn't get in the hypothetical that Justice Ginsburg posed.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We thought we would not seek further monetary relief.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So what --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you know how many claims in this case that -- that were not in the Delaware case?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5430 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We have affirmative defenses to the New Jersey I, but -- but the claims in New Jersey II and Delaware are the same, Your Honor.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is your answer that you might want equitable relief, an injunction to continue making payments in the future, or something like that?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. We're not seeking additional monetary or equitable relief.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You -- you would be stuck anyway because you made a counterclaim and -- and it would be -- on which you prevailed. And in that counterclaim you would be precluded if you didn't ask for everything that you could get. But -- but at this stage at least, the -- the door -- there -- there is still conceivably an avenue of further litigation because, SABIC hasn't yet said that it's not going to do anything more, that it isn't going to petition for cert, for example.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And, indeed, Your Honor. I mean, SABIC has represented to the Court that it likely intends to seek certiorari relief from this Court in the Delaware suit.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So it has --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So if they do, it's not finished.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is not finished --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, all right. I'll ask them that.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Getting back to the Rooker-Feldman issue, which is the issue on which the Court granted cert, Rooker-Feldman is a narrow, limited doctrine, but it bars only appellate review not parallel litigation in Federal district courts. Rooker-Feldman is not a theory of vanishing original jurisdiction, nor is it a jurisdictional substitute for the preclusion analysis mandated by Congress in the Full Faith and Credit Act. The expansive interpretation asserted by SABIC misperceives the fundamental nature of appellate review. It's untethered to any natural negative implication in 28 U.S.C. 1257. It illegitimately displaces the application of section 1738, the Full Faith and Credit Act, in most cases to which it is traditionally applied, and it serves absolutely no useful purpose.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the problem that bothers me -- and I don't know that there's an answer to it -- is you have plaintiff. Plaintiff goes into State court. He brings a lawsuit, a tort suit, a contract suit. And then he decides he'd also like to go to Federal court. He brings exactly the same suit. And here we have two suits and exactly the same thing running along at the same time. Now, I know there are principles from this Court's case law that says, well, that's what's supposed to happen. They've always bothered me. But now let's take a special instance. The special instance is that in court one in the State, the plaintiff loses. Now, what he decides to do is to say to the Federal court, we want you to review what they did in the State court. Can't do that. Right?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. So he brilliantly figures out I will omit the word review from my -- from my motion. I will ask for precisely the same thing just not use that word review. I will ask them to go and make their decision which happens to be -- in my opinion should be -- 100 percent the opposite of what the State court did showing they're wrong. But I won't use the word review. Now, you say because he cut the word review out, he can do it.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Breyer. It's not because he cut the review out. Rooker-Feldman is an issue of appellate -- the exercise of appellate jurisdiction. So what does appellate jurisdiction mean? Well, appellate --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Coleman, would you clarify, I think, in response to Justice Breyer's inquiry? Rooker-Feldman both involved State court litigation that was over and done with. Then you come to the Federal court. You have two parallel cases would be -- brought within a month of each other?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Within 2 months of each other. Within a month of each other, Your Honor.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And isn't the standard defense of the person who has started the other suit first, well, Your Honor, prior action pending, please hold the case that started second in abeyance till we get done? And if we win in the first case, then it will be precluded. Then the second case -- the parallel case will be precluded. That's not Rooker-Feldman territory.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's -- that's -- Your Honor, that's our position that -- concurrent jurisdiction is a separate issue from the appellate review issue that Rooker-Feldman raises. Justice Breyer, the answer to your hypothetical is that appellate review is something different from having a parallel action. Appellate review is probably best defined by two characteristics that I'll try to flesh out for you. The first is that the proponent alleges some sort of injury-causing error by the trial court and not by the adversary and then seeks an order reversing, vacating, or otherwise nullifying that lower court order. When a party alleges an injury by his adversary rather than the trial court, the most that can really be said is that you are continuing on a parallel litigation but not that you are seeking appellate review. You do not have what looks like appellate review. You're not alleging errors by the lower court. You're not seeking an order that directly nullifies or otherwise undoes the State court judgment.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but the argument -- it seems to me the argument is that in a de facto sense, when you try to litigate the Federal case, after losing the State case, you in effect are asking the Federal court in some sense to review what happened in the State court. Justice Ginsburg's answer to that is preclusion is the answer. Is that your answer?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because if that -- if that is -- if we accept that as the answer, then there's no argument for saying you should expand Rooker-Feldman to include the de facto review as opposed to the -- the very strict sense of review that you're talking about.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is absolutely our position, Justice Souter, that preclusion addresses all of these issues.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but can you -- can you expand on this a little? I'm not taking a view on it. I'm trying to clear up what's a confusion in my mind. I see how you could do this on the parallel business with -- with delaying it on the docket and using the doctrine of preclusion. I understand that. But we've still got this doctrine called Rooker Feldman out there, and as long as you have that doctrine, it strikes me as odd if -- say, it weren't a plaintiff. Say it was the losing party, you know, that was asking the Federal judge, Judge, you have this case on your docket. Let's move it up. Let's decide it now. He doesn't use the word review, but everything else is the same. He wants a decision out of that court that is going to be the opposite of what the State court did. And what's concerning me -- maybe I shouldn't be concerned, but what's concerning me is whether he can get it or not seems to turn completely on whether he uses the word review in the petition.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't -- I don't think that that is true. It should not and does not turn on the words that you use in your petition. What it turns on is the fundamental nature of the injury that you claim and of the relief that you seek. One reason why you don't need to be necessarily concerned about this is that in all of these cases in which one case has gone to judgment and there is a -- either a continuation or a new case, preclusion is going to cover these. The only extension of Rooker-Feldman that SABIC is asking for is what they call the actually litigated test. That is the heart of the Full Faith and Credit Act.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Rooker-Feldman, if I understand it correctly, is a subject matter jurisdiction bar. Is that --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. It --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. And --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- it arises from a negative implication taken from section 1257 and a second negative implication from 1331.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, to -- so if the two lawsuits, the State court suit and the Federal suit -- they're proceeding concurrently or one is held in abeyance waiting the other, there is certainly subject matter jurisdiction in the Federal court of the Federal action.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To apply Rooker-Feldman in that context would say you had subject matter jurisdiction at the outset, but then you lost it somewhere down the line.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and -- yes, Justice Ginsburg. And that's a distinction between your hypothetical and Justice Breyer's. Justice Breyer's, as I -- if I understand it correctly, is that the Federal suit starts after the State court is done. Yours is where you have parallel actions at the same time. And where the Federal claims are parallel or even filed first, as in our case, you can't say that the moment you file those that you're seeking review of some nonexistent State court judgment. You're simply asking for relief from something that your adversary did to you. And the argument that SABIC makes that the court relinquishes jurisdiction has no basis or justification in anything this Court has ever said. It is a theory of vanishing jurisdiction that I cannot understand.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Coleman, can I interrupt with a question?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it your position that what should have been done in this case, not in the hypothetical case, is the trial court should have just stayed the action pending the outcome of the Delaware case?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And, in fact, that's what the Federal district court had done, Your Honor.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that's what -- he did -- that was correct.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And then when the Delaware case was over, then what should he have done?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we could either ultimately dismiss it or the Federal district court could say, looks like your Delaware case is over. SABIC brings a motion --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and he has given you all the relief your entitled to. Therefore, you go ahead and dismiss the case.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, or SABIC brings a motion --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And therefore, my next question is why shouldn't we do exactly that now.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because the question before the Court today is a question of jurisdiction, not of practical consequences other than the mootness question that SABIC has raised. But practical consequences are that what we may --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, maybe we could vacate the judgment of the court of appeals, say that was wrong, but still, order it dismissed after we vacate the judgment.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think, as in Feldman, that's a question that should be first addressed by the district court. Certainly we hope that you will vacate or reverse the Third Circuit's judgment and allow the district court to address those issues. Perhaps we dismiss it.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if you don't tell us what issue remains, I don't know why we shouldn't just direct the suit to be dismissed.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There -- there is a live -- in -- in the terms of Article III, there are live claims that remain pending before the district court. And while it is true --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I take it that's because you don't have the cert period expired yet in the first action and you don't have the check.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At the very minimum --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. It's -- if the 3 months is expired and the check is in your hand and it's certified, what's left?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As a practical matter, we have no intention. As a jurisdictional matter, there's still --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not asking about your intention. Let's assume you do intend to litigate further. What for?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If we did intend to litigate further, SABIC would be entitled to go to the district court and say they can't. They are precluded.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I want -- I want an answer to my question. What are you going to litigate for? What's left?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, again, setting aside our intentions and hypothetically, there are cases in which --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm talking about your case. What's left?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- we do not seek -- will not seek any further review from the district court.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Nothing is left.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, suppose you don't have the check. What's left?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the case is still up in the air.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You have a judgment.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the case -- the case is not over. Indeed, because the State --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I never heard of a case that isn't over until you get the check. I thought the case is over when you have the judgment. (Laughter.)
03-1696 +++$+++ 5498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And then if they don't give you the check, you have a different matter. We have to get it enforced.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is a different matter. But as a matter of Article III jurisdiction, Your Honor, the -- the mootness doctrine does not apply to a situation where you have a judgment and it doesn't necessarily apply the moment you get paid.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose that you lost in the State court and the judgment is final. You then go to Federal court. Are -- is there a context in which Rooker Feldman might then be applicable? This is all hypothetical.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our argument is that it would be applicable only if the injury that we claimed in our Federal suit was an injury caused by the State court -- the court itself or the judge rather than our adversary and we sought relief from that judgment. That would obtain the nature of appellate jurisdiction rather than we say, well, SABIC did us wrong, we'd like a judgment. And then SABIC can come in and say, well, they're precluded. They already tried that.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In other words, if you had some ongoing relation and, in this hypothetical, the State court ruled against you and you went in to try to reverse that ruling, that would be -- that would Rooker-Feldman.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. If we alleged harm from the court and sought relief from the court's judgment.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5504 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There were only the two cases, Rooker and Feldman, that established this.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5505 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Has this Court ever said anything to suggest that Rooker-Feldman, as apart from preclusion doctrine, applies to parallel litigation instead of you go into Federal court after the State court is over and you're trying to undo what the State court did?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think this Court has ever held any such thing, and I think it would be inconsistent with at least Feldman itself. The idea of -- of appellate jurisdiction over the constitutional claims in Feldman that were held not to be barred comes down in the end -- SABIC says, well, those claims weren't actually litigated. But the opinion itself on page 467 points out that the Mr. Feldman had raised his constitutional claims in front of the D.C. Court of Appeals in terms of asking for his waiver. And when I checked the oral argument transcript from the Feldman case, it was mentioned specifically in terms of Mr. Feldman had raised the constitutional claims in front of the D.C. Court. And that's on pages 9, 14, and 16 of the LEXIS version of the oral argument transcript.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there's no preclusion unless they're also decided.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Well, yes. The district court could then decide whether in fact they were precluded, and -- and it's likely that they were. I didn't follow up on what happened when the case went back down on remand. But the Court said, we're not going to decide that. We will allow the district court to address that in the first instance. And so we think that the actually litigated revision of Rooker-Feldman is simply inconsistent with Feldman itself, that it improperly displaces full faith and credit that is not true to the negative implication from section 1257 which has to be a very narrow implication, indeed, because 1257 gives this Court jurisdiction, and it's only appellate jurisdiction, to suggest that another court doesn't have that appellate jurisdiction must be -- must be narrowly limited to the context, the type of lawsuits that this Court would seek, which is not simply they did me wrong, please -- please give me money, but rather, that lower court erred. It violated my rights. It is structurally or in some -- in violation of Federal rights or something that the court did and that you have been asked to fix. That, we think, is consistent with the proper negative implication from 1257, but overrunning most of preclusion law simply is not. For these reasons, we would ask the Court to reverse. And, Justice Stevens, I would like to reserve the remainder of my time.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You may do so. Mr. Castanias. I hope you'll tell us also whether you think the case is moot before you're through.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5512 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case is moot. There is nothing for Exxon Mobil to get at this --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you're still asking for cert.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right, and that's --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, then why is it moot? Because something could happen. We might get this case in theory, take it on cert, and discover a jurisdictional problem that somehow destroys the case without a decision, and should that happen, there luckily for them they have this other case going. So as long as -- you're prepared, I take it, to say you're going to ask for cert. If that's what you're going to say, I don't see how the case is over. It's up to you.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. Well, I'm -- I'm not going to take the Hobson's choice, Your Honor, but I am going to tell you, first of all, that SABIC is going to apply for cert. At least that's my current understanding. And second of all, that shows why this case is not justiciable at this point because if the most likely event in the -- in the event of this Court's review of the Delaware determination, is a reversal on a statute of limitations problem. That's the reason this suit was brought as the, quote, insurance policy that the Third Circuit identified, which was if the Delaware Supreme Court or the Delaware Superior Court had kicked this suit on the ground of the 3-year statute of limitations -- and if you look at page 20a of the supplemental brief, the corrected supplemental brief that we filed with the Court, including the Delaware Supreme Court's opinion, you'll see that they had a whale of a time getting over the plain language of their own statute.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. If for -- somehow you won on that, even though it sounds a little like a State law issue, but nonetheless, if you won on that and they reversed it as a statute of limitations, then what they're saying is, well, that's just why we filed in Federal court. We didn't want the Federal court to review the State court. We wanted our Federal court suit as an insurance policy in case something goes wrong with the State court suit. It has nothing whatsoever to do with Rooker-Feldman. It is parallel adjudication, just what he said. Now, what's your response?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My response, Justice Breyer, is twofold. First of all, with regard to the mootness question, if that eventuality occurs, that's the time when there may be a justiciable issue for a Federal district court. Not now. We've been talking about ifs and hypotheticals and what may happen in the future.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Castanias, was there a proper case in the district court when the complaint was initially filed there some 2 months after you filed in Delaware?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We've never disputed that, Justice Ginsburg.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. So you can bring two cases, identical cases, in two different courts, and that's an everyday thing, and the defense is prior action pending.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, you are urging that Rooker-Feldman which this Court never applied when you had parallel litigation be extended into a domain which is ordinarily taken care of by preclusion doctrine. Why would you want to mix those two things up that now seem to me rather clear, that if you have Rooker-Feldman, when you rush into a Federal court and say, Federal court, undo that State court judgment, I don't like it? Rooker was just a paradigm case of that. Why would you want to spread that doctrine? What is -- what is there that preclusion doctrine doesn't accomplish?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, preclusion doctrine may accomplish this in a certain number of cases, but I think it's important -- and I think I have to correct my colleague on the other side here with regard to the state of the record. Yes, there was a stay of the New Jersey II trial court litigation, but it wasn't because of the Colorado River application that we made. In fact, if you'll look in the appendix to the petition --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm not talking about anything fancy like Colorado River. Prior action pending is a familiar defense. You've got two actions. They could even be in different districts of the same State and one says, Your Honor, this case started second, the other one is going forward, hold it abeyance because there's a prior action pending. That's not Colorado River abstention or anything like that.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, you will see that that is a component of Colorado River, and that was part of the application that we made to the district court in this case under Colorado River. And my only answer -- the only reason that I'm bringing this up, Justice Ginsburg, is that if you'll look in the appendix to the petition for certiorari, you will see that SABIC, my client, made an application for Colorado River abstention, and the district court denied that. The district court denied that in this case.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, sometimes district judges rule incorrectly, but -- but what happened here is the district court case did not go on because the two of you, both sides, said, okay, the district court -- they're all bollixed up with this Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act, so we're going to agree. You agreed that the case would go forward in Delaware, the trial in Delaware. Is that not so?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it was -- it was -- if you'll look at -- I believe this is at page 8a of the addendum to the red brief. You'll see that it was Exxon Mobil that pushed in Delaware, but that actually happened before the ruling on sovereign immunity, that -- that they elected to go forward in Delaware.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, when you say they pushed in Delaware, you brought them into Delaware and a -- in a reverse suit. You wanted a declaration of non liability.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They brought their case for liability in the Federal forum. They were forced by you into the Delaware forum, and now you're saying you were pushed, that Exxon pushed. You brought the case in Delaware. They didn't.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We -- that is true that we brought the initial case, but the case was eventually tried on their counterclaims. The case was inverted to make them the party plaintiff. They went first at trial and is it -- at the page I cited to you, that was where they decided to go forward with the Delaware case.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it was your preferred forum, not theirs. When they filed their complaint, they filed it in New Jersey where they had a related case pending. So you chose the forum.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- that is absolutely the case with regard to the Delaware matter. But I think what your question is getting at -- and I think I have to go back a couple of minutes in our colloquy here to talk about why abstention won't do the work in this case. In the lion's share of cases, it probably will, Your Honor, but in this case it didn't. And this brings me back to Justice Breyer's question which said -- in which he said that -- that concurrent jurisdiction has always bothered him because what you're ending up with is a race to judgment. But it's important again, Justice Breyer. It's a race to judgment.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's -- you see, Justice Ginsburg answered that. I -- I mean, she wasn't answering my question, but she did say what was a perfectly satisfactory approach, that -- that the second person says, you know, Judge, there's another one pending and the judge says, okay, we'll let that go first except in some unusual instance.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which happens thousands of times in -- in all of the courts. It's very common and I don't know why we're over-designing this vehicle. It's simply other action pending. End of case.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Kennedy --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Or end of argument, not end of case. (Laughter.)
03-1696 +++$+++ 5539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So why isn't it that the end? I mean, here it's not moot. They filed the other action. You point out that you not only think something could wreck the State claim, you would love it to wreck the State claim. And -- and therefore, they have this insurance policy in Federal court which they'll gear up if and when the State claim does get wrecked as you hope.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, I think this is the point in the argument where I want to turn to the definition of review as this Court has -- has put it forth in cases like ASARCO. This is a case that Exxon Mobil dismisses in their reply brief as mere dictum. I don't think that this -- the discussion of Rooker-Feldman and the ASARCO case can be dismissed as dictum in that it was a specific response to a specific proposal by the United States appearing as amicus to dismiss the case for lack of standing and instead remit plaintiffs to pursuing a second suit. In that case, the Court wrote that to re adjudicate -- and I'm quoting here from the opinion, and I don't have the particular page here -- to re-adjudicate the very same issues that were determined in the State court proceedings would be -- again quoting -- in essence, an attempt to obtain direct review of the Arizona Supreme Court's decision in the lower Federal courts. In ASARCO, there was no reference to what the intent of the plaintiffs was. There was no reference to what the timing of the lawsuits was. It was simply that identical issues actually litigated.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So perhaps the Court, if it had been more cautious, would have spoken not in terms of Rooker-Feldman or review, but in terms of this matter has been decided. It is claim-precluded. That's what preclusion doctrine is supposed to do. So in that context, maybe this Court used the wrong word. Maybe it should have said, you litigated it, it's over and done with, now it's precluded. Why do you need to interject the word review? Isn't that -- unless you're going to say every time court A decides a case and then you're in court B and someone is raising the same claim, that is a review of court number one rather than you're precluded in court two because of what is -- has been litigated and decided in court one.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, first of all, Justice Ginsburg, I'm hesitant to say that this Court was incautious in its use of words. This was --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is sometimes.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- understandably, but -- but with regard to -- with regard to Rooker-Feldman, it was not just -- it was not just an accidental -- incidental invocation of it. It was the reason for the rejection of the argument. The reason was not res judicata. The reason was respect for the dignity of the State court's work in the case, and that's ultimately --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's why one has preclusion because you are giving respect, full faith and credit, to a decision elsewhere. That's what preclusion doctrine is all about. We respect the judgment of the court that rendered it. We, therefore, give it full faith and credit. That's what preclusion doctrine is about, is about respect and credit. Isn't that so?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's -- that's -- that is -- that is generally right, Justice Ginsburg, but at the same time, there -- we all agree -- Exxon Mobil, SABIC, and the decisions of this Court -- that there has to be some overlap with regard to Rooker-Feldman and SABIC -- and -- excuse me -- and -- and preclusion doctrine. The -- the argument made by Exxon Mobil, which is, in essence, the same question you're asking me, would have destroyed any reason whatsoever for the Rooker and the Feldman cases, as well as the ASARCO case. There's also a significant body of law that's body of law that's been built up over the last 85 years in the lower courts in -- in this regard. And --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So some of the lower courts have given a broad interpretation to Rooker-Feldman and have turned it into something other than the narrower view of it. And I think that's why we granted cert in this case, to decide whether to give it a broad or a narrow interpretation. The Third Circuit applies a rather broad interpretation of it.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I guess in that respect, Justice O'Connor, I disagree because the Third Circuit, admitted by its own words, applies a very narrow version of Rooker-Feldman. And, in fact, using this case as the vehicle to decide this, the -- the definition of Rooker-Feldman in this instance amounts to no more than barring jurisdiction in a second Federal suit over the identical claims. This is not a case where you have to worry about claims that might have been brought, the sort of things that footnote 16 in Feldman dealt with.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But maybe that isn't a proper application of Rooker-Feldman where the complaint is not about something the State court has improperly done.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It isn't. And so in that sense, the Third Circuit has a rather broader view of it I'd say.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, to be sure, Justice O'Connor, the Third Circuit's view is broader than that which appears to be adopted by the Ninth Circuit, as well as the Seventh Circuit. And I think this brings me back to the definition of review. The -- the Ninth and Seventh Circuits' views in our estimation are wrong because they strictly look to the subjective intent of the plaintiff and as to whether the plaintiff is, in fact, seeking reversal. That -- that's the term that's used in these cases. Noel says seeking to set aside. But section 1257 --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course, that's the language that was used in both Rooker and Feldman too I think.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's because, Justice Stevens, that's -- that was the particular fact pattern of this -- of that case.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's the only fact pattern any of our cases have dealt with.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's -- in the Supreme Court, that's right.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the -- and the concern is I think -- at least as I understand the -- the concern with it, it -- it boils down to something like this. Somebody comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion. Don't apply it because, for whatever reason, there's this -- there's something wrong here, and -- and Federal court should determine the -- in fact, the -- the claim preclusion of the State judgment should not apply. The answer to that is, look, that's an issue to be raised by way of appeal of your State judgment. You don't appeal State judgments in Federal court. Out. There's no such claim being made here. The only claim that's being made here or the only conceivable claim, I guess, that can be made here is that we might want to do some litigating in the Federal case after the State case is over. There's no claim here that claim preclusion should not apply in that instance, and because there's no such argument that claim preclusion does not apply, the answer to the problem that you're worried about is simply claim preclusion doctrine. There's no reason to add a perihelion or something onto Rooker-Feldman to deal with what is really a very simple problem and that is, if they try to relitigate anew in Federal court, as Justice Ginsburg says, you -- you plead claim preclusion. Simple. Why do we need to complicate it beyond that simplicity?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Souter, I -- I don't have any qualms with the application of claim preclusion here. The -- the Third Circuit, though, was being -- was being sensitive to the interests of the State courts, as well as sensitive to the fact that it had another jurisdictional issue in front of it, which was subject matter jurisdiction under the FSIA. And I'm -- I'm certain, as certain can be, that that court would have reached the same result if res judicata had been before it. But the -- the fact is that Rooker-Feldman is there and, again, as -- as with my response to Justice Ginsburg earlier, your -- your question would effectively rub out any need for even Rooker and Feldman themselves.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, no, because the -- it -- it would not rule out the need to have some answer when someone in a Federal court comes along and says, don't apply claim preclusion, whatever the reason may be. Don't apply the claim preclusion rules. There's something unfair about doing it here. The answer to that is, look, what you're really asking us to do, when you say don't apply claim preclusion, is to review what happened in the State court, and we don't sit as an appellate court on State courts. So there's still something for Rooker Feldman to do on, as it were, Justice -- Justice Ginsburg's claim preclusion argument.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Souter, I think again, with respect to the hypothetical that you've put to me, the claim preclusion is appropriately --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5562 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It'll get the -- it'll get the job done that you say will need to be done if you get to that point.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it should get the job done.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why won't it?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5565 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there -- there are -- first of all, there are no guarantees. The -- the preclusion doctrines are -- are riddled with exceptions.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5566 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then -- then you --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5567 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The preclusion doctrine --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then -- then you appeal. Don't ask for a new body of law. Just say, look, you got the application of claim preclusion wrong in this case. We're going to appeal.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I disagree, Justice Souter, that -- that we're asking for anything like a huge, new body of law or that the Third Circuit was making a huge, new body of law.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you're asking us to extend Rooker-Feldman beyond where this Court has taken it, and if I recall correctly, you really didn't ask for this. The Third Circuit injected Rooker-Feldman into the case. Is that not true?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's true, Justice Ginsburg, but it's true because of the briefing cycle. When we briefed the case, there was no Delaware judgment. And it was only on the eve of oral argument --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ms. Castanias --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- could -- could I come back to mootness? One -- one could say that not only is claim preclusion the answer to Rooker-Feldman, it's also the answer to the asserted mootness here. I mean, you -- you don't have to move to dismiss it as moot. All you have to do is move to dismiss because of a prior adjudication that has resolved this question. Do you know of any case in which the existence of a prior judgment in another court has been held to render a suit that someone wants to press to get a second judgment moot? I mean, you'd think there would be a case on that, and I suppose the reason there isn't is that because the other side is always going to plead res judicata.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, or the other side is going to give up.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Or give up. But is there any case in which mootness is established by the fact that there is a prior judgment of another court giving you what you are asking for from this Court?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, in the -- in the realm that we're talking about here, the Fourth Circuit's decision in the Friedman's case came to a mootness conclusion. We've also cited in our brief -- and I don't recall the names of them off the top of my head -- two cases in which the Court either -- either dismissed or remanded for consideration of mootness in light of another State court judgment. So I think there is -- there is a body of law, but I also know that it is -- as recently as yesterday looking at Wright and Miller on this issue, that when complete relief has been accorded by another tribunal, that is the classic case of mootness.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I don't know why -- well, if it's -- if it were so classic, there would be a lot of cases, and I don't -- I'm not sure that any of yours are right on point. And -- and I think the reason is that you don't need it, that claim preclusion is -- is the remedy for the party who wants to get out of it.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, and again, I'm -- I'm certainly not going to fight claim preclusion because this is a suit that should not be here. This is -- this has had moving parts since we -- since the petition was granted with the Delaware Supreme Court ruling and now with yesterday's denial of reargument in the Delaware Supreme Court. What --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is it moot? Or even on -- why does claim preclusion apply? I mean, if you win, from what you've said -- somehow convince us that this refusal to apply the State statute of limitations properly violated some Federal law, let's say -- then that would show that the State statute of limitations applied and barred their claim. Would that be sufficient to knock out the Federal suit too?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not sure I understand the question, Justice Breyer.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, is -- does the State statute of limitations, if -- if it applied to the State's case, does it also apply in the Federal cases, the identical ground that everybody agrees that the State statute governs?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the -- there could be -- there could be issue-preclusive grounds on such a ruling, Justice Breyer, but -- but --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, if you -- if you win, then -- then -- if you win your State case, because of the argument you made, do you also automatically win the Federal case? Is it the same issue?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I don't think I could say that at this point because --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it may not be the same issue. Then -- then they say, okay, it's not going to be claim preclusion, and you'd have to say insofar as it's not the same issue, it's not claim preclusion. And therefore, they could proceed with their Federal case, which is what they want to do I guess.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and that is a future event.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. So we can't say it's moot in any -- and we can't say there's an alternative basis where they'd win, can we? I mean, I'm saying -- I'm thinking if we get into conference, we're discussing this case, and I say, well, I have to think this through, is it the case that if you're right and you end up winning in this Court, that their case in Federal court is over? I think no, it may not be. The answer is it may not be. Then this is not moot at all. This is not claim-precluded at all. They then might proceed with their Federal claim.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I guess, Justice Breyer --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that right or not?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think it's right.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and I think the reason it's not right is because that just shows that there's no live controversy right now. That's a controversy that might happen in the future.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, well, but that -- that isn't fair to them because, for all I know, they filed the Federal case because there's a different statute of limitations, say, that governs it that will have expired if you don't let them file it by the time -- until this whole thing is over. They just wanted it as protection.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, two answers to that, Justice Breyer. First of all, that seems to be a -- a place for State doctrines of tolling to apply, not Federal law. Second of all, this Court in -- in Heck against Humphrey, which we cited in our brief, solves this --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's explaining the unclear by the incredibly hard to understand.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Justice Breyer.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's explaining the unclear by reference to the incomprehensible. But go ahead. (Laughter.)
03-1696 +++$+++ 5599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think I wrote that opinion. (Laughter.)
03-1696 +++$+++ 5600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And indeed, you did, Justice Scalia.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I never did like it. (Laughter.)
03-1696 +++$+++ 5602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I've also gotten that impression. But -- but Heck I think teaches an important -- Heck teaches an important lesson for this case as well, which is that Heck was just a suit for money damages, just like this suit. And -- and yet, this Court said that there's going to be no cause of action under section 1983 because of the intersection of 1983 and habeas. Well, we have the same result here. There should be no Federal court case here because of the intersection of section 1257 --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, because it's where you walk in the door. And you started out by saying this case, I think as you must, was a proper Federal case. It was properly filed in -- and it was properly filed in Delaware. So you can't talk about a case that says, if you've got this kind of case, you go in this door. If that kind of case, you go in that door. You have a case here that could go in either door, the Federal, the State. The usual rule is, is it not, that if Federal jurisdiction attaches, it doesn't get lost because of subsequent events. For example, if a defendant moves into the plaintiff's State and the only basis for Federal jurisdiction is diversity, subject matter jurisdiction isn't lost, is it?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, and in fact, the case that's cited against us for that proposition, the Freeport McMoran case, makes clear, in the portion of it not cited by Exxon Mobil, that that rule is limited to the diversity context. And it's not -- it -- it does not have its genesis in statute, but it's in policy. We don't want to keep people from moving across State lines. We don't want to -- want to impede their -- their free movement. So we're going to look at it at the time of filing. But what we have here is a case where maybe it was original jurisdiction when the case was filed, but it's not original anymore.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Maybe. It's not -- it's not maybe --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, in this case, yes. In this case, yes. But original jurisdiction when the case was filed but not anymore because there's nothing original about it.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ A case can become moot, but we've already expressed considerable doubt whether that is the fate of this case. The notion -- you used it derisively -- the insurance policy. Lawyers bring protective actions all the time, don't they? There's nothing wrong with doing that.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I guess I come back to -- to where I started with Justice Breyer on the -- on the merits of the Rooker-Feldman issue this morning, which is that the concurrent jurisdiction is something to be dealt with. This Court has an uneasy body of law in the abstention area dealing with the issue of concurrent jurisdiction, but what it doesn't have is anything that deals with judgments, once you get to a judgment.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you? It's perhaps an unfair question. The Chief Justice generally likes to confine our attention to cases of this Court rather than the courts of appeals for our primary guidance, and most of the Rooker-Feldman law is court of appeals law, as we -- we both know. Going back just to Rooker and to Feldman, those two cases, and putting aside ASARCO for a minute, which of those two cases do you think provides you the stronger support, if indeed any support, between Rooker and Feldman?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I would have to say that Feldman, of the two of them, is probably stronger support.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5611 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that is the case in which the court of appeals was itself a party to the litigation.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5612 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASTANIAS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. But at the same time, the -- the Rooker case also dealt with relitigation of the identical issues. And if I could just sum up here, seeing that the light is on here, the issue in this case is limited to identical lawsuits, identical claims. The Third Circuit's decision in this case, if it constitutes an extension of Rooker-Feldman at all, is only a modest extension because it recognizes, consistent with ASARCO, consistent with Heck, and consistent with the very notion, Justice Souter, of de facto appeals, not actual appeals, but de facto appeals being prohibited by the doctrine -- it recognizes that claims actually litigated in a State suit to a judgment, if they are litigated anew in the Federal court, that is de facto appellate review. The judgment of the Third Circuit should be affirmed.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that depends on who wins.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're right.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5618 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, if you lost in the other suit, your claim here wouldn't be moot. I mean, it -- it would be precluded, but it's certainly not moot.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5619 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I think that's right. I'd also like to address, just very briefly, the ASARCO question. The language that the Court used in there we don't necessarily think was loose or inappropriate, Justice Ginsburg, and the reason was the Court cites at that point an amicus brief by the United States and it cites a particular footnote. And what that footnote says is it's a recommendation that the mining company in that case could file a Federal lawsuit seeking a judgment that the invalidation of the statute was not necessary. But by challenging the invalidation itself, that -- that looks more like a direct challenge to the State court judgment. It's not simply a relitigation. So that behind the Court's language there -- and of course, it was really just addressing standing. It was not directly addressing Rooker-Feldman. But the U.S.'s suggestion in that case was a suit challenging the State court judgment, and in that situation, it looks more like appellate review, more likely to infringe upon Rooker Feldman-type interests. In the end, we believe that preclusion doctrines adequately cover all of this, that it is not true --
03-1696 +++$+++ 5620 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Coleman, I don't mean to take your time, but in the ASARCO case, was the State court judgment final at the time in dispute?
03-1696 +++$+++ 5621 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, there's a question about that. I mean, the Court kept jurisdiction, but there was a determination that the statute was invalidate -- was invalid and then a remand back to the district court for further proceedings.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5622 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because if the judgment were final, then that would fit right into your -- your analysis, if the judgment of the State court were final.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5623 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, it would.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLEMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In the -- at the end of the day, we believe that this Court's preclusion jurisprudence is not riddled with vagaries, that it's not difficult to understand, and that it's certainly not more vague or difficult than the borrowing that they are attempting to do to bring existing preclusion doctrines into -- in order to expand Rooker-Feldman. Preclusion is the answer in this case. We believe that the district court should be permitted to address that in the first instance, and we would ask the Court to reverse the judgment of the Third Circuit. Thank you.
03-1696 +++$+++ 5626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Coleman. The case is submitted.
03-184 +++$+++ 5630 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ The Court will now hear argument in Ballard against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Mr. Shapiro.
03-184 +++$+++ 5632 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Judge Cudahy stated in his dissent in the Seventh Circuit that disclosure of the rule 183 report in this case should be required on both statutory and constitutional grounds. As Judge Cudahy put it, there is no item of more significance in evaluating a Tax Court's decision on fraud than the unfiltered findings of the STJ.
03-184 +++$+++ 5633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Shapiro, can this case, in your view, be decided solely on the statutory question?
03-184 +++$+++ 5634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes, Your Honor. We believe it can.
03-184 +++$+++ 5635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There also are due process allegations, and I'm not sure I even quite understand what the precise due process violation is that's alleged. But I would like you to address both and to tell us, first of all, how it would be resolved solely on a statutory basis from your perspective.
03-184 +++$+++ 5636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The readiest ground for decision is the statutory basis, and we believe that the statute is a good means to avoid a complex due process question. There are two statutes that are key here. One is the appellate review statute. The other is the public record statute. The public record statute says all reports of the Tax Court are public records, and we're talking about a report of the Tax Court in this case. The legislative history of that provision shows Congress had the broadest possible intent to make all practices in the Tax Court completely transparent. All steps in the adjudication were supposed to be --
03-184 +++$+++ 5637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, would that include -- if a Tax Court judge had a law clerk, would it include law clerk memos to the judge?
03-184 +++$+++ 5638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- we don't take that position. It refers to reports of judges, and this is a report of a trial judge who heard the witnesses. The report is presumed correct under rule 183. It's the only independent evaluation of witness credibility --
03-184 +++$+++ 5639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, why -- why do you say that?
03-184 +++$+++ 5640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- and the only judge --
03-184 +++$+++ 5641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would you elaborate for this reason? Because the briefs and you again today keep talking about that first document. You use the word report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, to me that's the whole conclusion of the case. I'm prepared to assume, at least for the moment, if you can convince me that that's the report they're talking about, you'd win. But that isn't what the Government says. The Government says that's a piece of paper, preliminary. We -- like my draft. I write drafts all the time. So -- so do trial judges. And he goes and brings the draft to the other two judges and says, let's sit down and talk about it. And they sit down and talk about it, and he changes his mind and writes a different document. And that different document, of course, is totally public. The whole opinion of the Tax Court. There is that document.
03-184 +++$+++ 5644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is only one rule 183 report. Under the rule, it's the report the trial judge prepares and submits to the chief judge at the completion of the trial, which contains his independent credibility findings.
03-184 +++$+++ 5645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do we know that? Now -- now, what is the answer specifically in the statute? Let's call it document 1 and document 2. And it really didn't help me that much in the briefs to see document 1 continuously labeled with the word report when I thought that's the key question. Is it? Is it that report they're referring to? So now, go ahead.
03-184 +++$+++ 5646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under rule 183(b) there is a report denominated as such. There's no question here it was submitted to the court. If you look at page 114a of the Kanter appendix, it says that the special trial judge submitted a report, as required by rule 183(b). And this case was then referred to Judge Dawson. He had no involvement with the case until this report was given to him.
03-184 +++$+++ 5647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which --
03-184 +++$+++ 5648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry.

03-184 +++$+++ 5657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- which is in the Government's brief at 4a? It says, special trial judge's report. It is the only report to which the Tax Court rules refer.
03-184 +++$+++ 5658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor. And it's --
03-184 +++$+++ 5659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and if in fact --
03-184 +++$+++ 5660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- it is presumed correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- you rely on the rule, do we even have to resolve the issue of meaning of report in the statute? Can't we simply, from your position, rely on the rule and say you've got to follow your own rules?
03-184 +++$+++ 5662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely. This is a report that must be submitted. It is presumed correct under this rule. It's an independent evaluation of credibility from the only judge who heard the witnesses, and of course, it's part of the record. And it doesn't --
03-184 +++$+++ 5663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you've really got three arguments. You've got the rule. You've got the statute, and you have due process.
03-184 +++$+++ 5664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it doesn't make the slightest difference that the superior judge caused the subordinate judge to say, I have changed my mind at a later stage in the proceeding, because it is the original report that is presumed correct under the rules.
03-184 +++$+++ 5665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Now, what -- what was the page? Please. You're going quite -- and I want to -- because Justice Ginsburg referred to a statement in the Government's brief that you said yes --
03-184 +++$+++ 5666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, not the Government's brief. The Tax Court rules.
03-184 +++$+++ 5667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's -- that's appendix 4a.
03-184 +++$+++ 5668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 4a of the Government's brief.
03-184 +++$+++ 5669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's the rule.
03-184 +++$+++ 5670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, it's the rule itself, 183(b). And it makes it clear that there must be a report filed with the chief judge. The docket here says that that was done.
03-184 +++$+++ 5671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can you make the argument that -- maybe you can't -- that the special trial judge can go to the Tax Court judge, with the permission of the chief judge, and say, now, here's what -- kind of what I'm thinking? It's not my report, but here's what I'm thinking. And then the -- the Tax Court judge says, well, why don't you have some more findings on X and Y and Z? He says, okay, and then he goes back. Can you make the argument that that first document is not the report?
03-184 +++$+++ 5672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The first -- there is only one --
03-184 +++$+++ 5673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I guess another way of saying it is, do the rules permit any consultation before the report is submitted? I -- I guess that's my question.
03-184 +++$+++ 5674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The rules are silent on that, but Judge Dawson has no involvement in the case until the report is submitted. Then the case is assigned to Judge Dawson, and then he is supposed to review it under a presumptive correctness standard. So it would be surprising if there were consultation of that sort. But what we contend is if there is consultation behind the scenes about credibility determinations, then it is critically important that the report be submitted and made part of the record and not concealed, and that the deferential standard of review be --
03-184 +++$+++ 5675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would -- would that problem be overcome if the special trial judge simply -- if his -- the proceedings before him were simply videotaped and then the reviewing judge, Judge Dawson in this case, could look at the trial proceedings and would have as much of a notion of the credibility of the witnesses as the special tax judge?
03-184 +++$+++ 5676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I suppose that's a possibility, but in Anderson, the Court said absent some procedure like that, the trial judge is uniquely situated to evaluate demeanor and tone of voice, and because of that, great deference has to be given to the independent evaluation of the trial judge. Maybe in a -- in the future the Tax Court would want to use a procedure like that to mitigate the Raddatz problem that they now have.
03-184 +++$+++ 5677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In which case, they -- they might well revise the language of their rule.
03-184 +++$+++ 5678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, they -- they might, and --
03-184 +++$+++ 5679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which currently requires that the finding of facts of the trial judge be presumed to be correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, and after all, we should remember that the Government was supposed to present clear and convincing evidence of fraud in this case, and if there was a flip-flop of this sort going on behind the scenes, leaving no trace in the record, what could be more important to the reviewing court than to know what had occurred at the first stage and the second stage here? If the trial judge found no underpayment and no fraud, which we have reason to believe he did -- three Tax Court judges stated that to us -- if that was -- that was his finding and he found our witnesses to be credible, then an unexplained overturning of that credibility determination with no trace in the record would surely be a candidate for reversal on appeal.
03-184 +++$+++ 5681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let -- let me ask this question, if I may. Suppose the -- a special trial judge hears the witnesses, makes a report. It's assigned by the chief judge to a Tax Court judge, and the Tax Court judge looks it over it and says, you know, before I -- before I really spend a lot of time on this, you really didn't explore these three problems. Would you please do it over again? Is he permitted to do that or is that a violation of the rule that he shall presume the report to be correct?
03-184 +++$+++ 5682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we haven't challenged the conversations as such. We think it is -- it is suspect, however. Under Raddatz, if somebody who has not heard the witnesses is telling somebody who has heard the witnesses, I don't agree or I think you may be wrong in your credibility determination, I'd like you to reconsider that, that's a serious Raddatz problem. And the only cure for that is to make the first report part of the record.
03-184 +++$+++ 5683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm asking if it's a violation of -- of the rule.
03-184 +++$+++ 5684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The --
03-184 +++$+++ 5685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because the -- the rule says a special report shall be presumed to be correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, what you're asking us to do would -- would just solve your problem in this case, and -- and in the future, I suppose they could revise rule 183 as simply not to require a report. There -- there's nothing in the statute that requires this report, is there?
03-184 +++$+++ 5690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's true. They could cease using the STJ's, but --
03-184 +++$+++ 5691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they could -- they could use them, but just say, instead of filing a report, he'll consult with the -- with the deciding judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I suppose that could happen. If there is -- if there is no report written, we couldn't contend it has to be disclosed under these statutes, and that -- that might be. But it -- there could be a Raddatz issue in that scenario that you present, Justice Scalia. If one judge heard the witnesses and the other judge didn't hear the witnesses and -- and the -- the superior judge --
03-184 +++$+++ 5693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they confer with each other. Maybe, maybe.
03-184 +++$+++ 5694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it -- it would be -- it would be quite strange to have credibility determinations made by a judge who had never heard from any of the witnesses.
03-184 +++$+++ 5695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What happens in cases in agencies, you know, where -- where -- suppose the agency itself or a member thereof is going to make a decision, and there might be other members who would hear the witnesses. And I was thinking of that analogy. It's possible. It happens in the Federal Communications Commission where the staff, you know, consults back and forth in ratemaking cases.
03-184 +++$+++ 5696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's hard to find precisely the analogy, but it seems likely.
03-184 +++$+++ 5698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the closest analogy in this Court's decisions is the Morgan II decision.
03-184 +++$+++ 5699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, which gives and takes away.
03-184 +++$+++ 5700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, Morgan II is really on point because there, a subordinate official drafted up findings, proposed findings, didn't serve them on the parties, but did give them to the decision-maker, the agency. And this Court held that was a violation of due process.
03-184 +++$+++ 5701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You have to have an opportunity to refute the information that's going to --
03-184 +++$+++ 5702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-184 +++$+++ 5703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and every administrative body that we know of in the Federal courts and in the State system too -- Chief Judge Vanderbilt pointed that out in the Mazza case. Every State in the Union requires disclosure of these administrative law decisions to the parties.
03-184 +++$+++ 5705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you analogize the STJ to the administrative ALJ. But you might also analogize him to a member of the agency itself, and if you make that analogy, it doesn't become so far-fetched, particularly when you look at Morgan as also not allowing you to probe at what's going on.
03-184 +++$+++ 5706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Well, we -- we've avoided suggesting that any depositions should be taken of -- of judicial personnel here. That's not our view. Our view is simply that the report that was prepared -- it was prepared -- should be made part of the record by virtue of two statutes. There is an appellate review statute, Justice O'Connor, that states quite expressly that Congress expected review to take place here just as it does in the district court, to the same degree, to the same extent, and in the same manner. And in the district court, if an adjunct judge makes a finding of fact, whether it's a master or a magistrate or bankruptcy judge, that is always disclosed to the parties.
03-184 +++$+++ 5707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Shapiro, is there any evidence in this record that the special trial judge in fact changed his report beyond the hearsay affidavit?
03-184 +++$+++ 5708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't know what is contained in that first report. We have heard from three of the judges, including the chief judge of the STJ's, that -- that what happened was that Judge Dawson rewrote the credibility findings. Now, we won't know until we see this. That could be wrong. But -- but it should be part of the record for the court of appeals.
03-184 +++$+++ 5709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Shapiro, on credibility, which you have been emphasizing, are you overstating the case for it? Because credibility is more than just observing the witnesses' demeanor. I mean, Judge Dawson could have said, yes, they -- these witnesses might have looked honest to the special trial judge, but considering this documentary evidence in the record, it's clear to me that what the witness said on the stand was a lie.
03-184 +++$+++ 5710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you'll see in perhaps a dozen situations, he says, I simply don't believe that witness, none of whom he heard. And this is a case where credibility was key. Was there a bribery scheme of the kind that the IRS claimed? Every witness who testified said no, it didn't exist. These are simple investments with the proceeds being paid to the corporations, and yet, the Government's theory was there is some nefarious bribery scheme that every witness denied. And there is no documentary evidence of that. The evidence of the proceeds flowing to these corporations was simply the result of their investing money in real estate deals. And so credibility was the key to this whole case. And the -- the Government, I don't think, can be serious when it tells this Court that this first report is some confidential document, that it's privileged internal deliberative material. For 40 years, the -- the Tax Court made these reports available to the public. It -- they were routinely served on the parties. For 40 years there was no suggestion --
03-184 +++$+++ 5711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would -- would you comment on that? I -- I understood from the brief there was a suggestion that if you prevail, we're going to have a huge volume of -- of printed material that we're not troubled with now.
03-184 +++$+++ 5712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes. That's a post hoc rationale. There was no such explanation when this rule was changed, and there's not a bit of work or a bit of expense resulting from our position. We simply ask for a copy of a report that exists. They can serve it on us electronically. It won't cost them a cent. We're making a very modest request under these statutes and under the Due Process Clause. And there was no explanation --
03-184 +++$+++ 5713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, now, wait. Under the Due Process Clause, I assume you would be asking for more than just access to the report. You -- if -- if you're really relying on Morgan II, he who hears must decide, I think you would be saying that after reading the report, you should have the opportunity to argue to the -- to Dawson here, to -- to the Tax Court judge that the report should not be adopted.
03-184 +++$+++ 5714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we defer to --
03-184 +++$+++ 5715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't that part of your due process case?
03-184 +++$+++ 5716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it really is not. We're asking --
03-184 +++$+++ 5717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You think it satisfies due process just to show you the report, and then --
03-184 +++$+++ 5718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To give -- and make it part of the appellate record. We're not asking for any remand to the Tax Court. If the Tax Court doesn't --
03-184 +++$+++ 5719 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, then -- then you're not relying on Morgan II.
03-184 +++$+++ 5720 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we -- we just rely on that as an example of the need to disclose this at an appropriate juncture.
03-184 +++$+++ 5721 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There wasn't a need to disclose the point that Morgan II made. It was he who hears must decide.
03-184 +++$+++ 5722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in Morgan II, the -- the point was that any -- any proposed findings that are drafted up have to be shared with the parties. Now, there they had to be shared with the parties at the administrative level. We're not going that far. If the Tax Court tells us that they don't want to have that layer of review within the Tax Court, they don't want to receive our comments on the initial report, that's fine with us. We want it to be made part of the appellate record so that the judges who are interested in this and believe it will shed a strong light on the issue of clear and convincing evidence can have this be part of the record. And already the Fifth Circuit has overturned the finding of fraud in this very same case.
03-184 +++$+++ 5723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do -- do I understand that you would be satisfied if the Court simply looked to -- what is it -- 7482(a)(1), the appellate review section, which says that the Tax Court decisions shall be reviewed in the same manner and to the same extent as district court decisions? And that --
03-184 +++$+++ 5724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. We'd be satisfied because that is a sufficient basis to say the record has to include the rule 183 report. And it is not up to the trial court to tell the appellate court what's in the record on appeal. It's up to the appellate court to -- to determine what goes into that -- that record. This -- the case in the Second Circuit on that is IBM v. United States where the Second Circuit analyzed rule 10(a) and said it is not the province of the trial court to dictate to the reviewing court what is in that record. And this Court in --
03-184 +++$+++ 5725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And where is it? It's -- it is specified someplace, but when you review a district court decision in -- in a court of appeals, the -- certainly the magistrate's report would be included, but there's someplace where it lists the contents, some rule that lists --
03-184 +++$+++ 5726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes. It's rule 10(a) and it's -- it's very general. It says that all the original papers in the trial court come before the appellate court, and an original report is an original document submitted in the trial court. And this Court confronted that question in Universal Camera 50 years ago, and the Government made the same arguments then that it's making now and it lost 7 to 2 in that case. It -- it said that the report --
03-184 +++$+++ 5727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Institutional memory. Isn't that -- that's a good institutional memory --
03-184 +++$+++ 5728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It goes back. (Laughter.)
03-184 +++$+++ 5734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's one thing that they can do. They can adopt it, but my question is, do they always adopt and never use -- never use the term modify or reject?
03-184 +++$+++ 5735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, no. They -- they do modify and reject. It's just it's hard to determine, when they are doing that. In the old days --
03-184 +++$+++ 5736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They -- they never say so in their opinion.
03-184 +++$+++ 5737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They don't --
03-184 +++$+++ 5738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They always say that they adopt the trial judge's report. Don't they?
03-184 +++$+++ 5739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. That's entirely correct. And now, in the old days, before they amended the rule, you could compare the two and see what was changed, but now you can't. You can't tell what has been changed. And in this instance, we believe there's been a complete rewrite of that first report, and the appellate courts can't tell what's going on. Was there a reason for doing this? Was deference given? Was some other agenda at work in this decision? No one can tell because it is all off the record.
03-184 +++$+++ 5740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what is -- can I ask you a really esoteric administrative law question, which I have never been able to figure out? It's probably relevant, but I -- this is an agency. That's what -- my great tax professor, Ernie Brown, used to say there is no Tax Court. He says, the Board of Tax Appeals shall be known as the Tax Court. What he meant by that is it's not -- it isn't the Tax Court, just known as. So -- so this is an agency, an administrative agency. So I look to the APA for guidance, and the APA, when you look at the section, says this initial decision can be made by a 556-qualified person. Now, a 556-qualified person can include the agency itself or a member of the agency or an ALJ. Then when you to look at what happens in 557, after that presiding employee makes an initial decision, it says you have to give a chance to the party to respond to the initial decision, which you like, in the case where the presiding employee -- presiding person is a subordinate employee. And so, that's what I was just checking here. And so -- so what's supposed to happen where the presiding person under 556 for that initial or tentative decision is not a subordinate employee, but rather, quote, one or more members of the body which comprise the agency? I've never run into that before. Maybe you haven't. Maybe they didn't mean anything by it, but maybe they did.
03-184 +++$+++ 5741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I haven't either. But the judge here certainly was subordinate and --
03-184 +++$+++ 5742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He was a subordinate employee?
03-184 +++$+++ 5743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, he was.
03-184 +++$+++ 5744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Rather than a member -- is -- is -- if he's a subordinate employee, that's easy. Then the case is easy I think.
03-184 +++$+++ 5745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He -- he is a subordinate because as the Government keeps telling us, the Tax Court judge is the only official spokesman for the court. They get to make the final judgment. And the Tax Court judge reviews what the STJ has done.
03-184 +++$+++ 5746 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ These -- these --
03-184 +++$+++ 5747 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you're -- you're not asserting that the APA governs this.
03-184 +++$+++ 5748 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh --
03-184 +++$+++ 5749 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I'm just looking --
03-184 +++$+++ 5750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't there an express exception for -- for --
03-184 +++$+++ 5751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, and this a court. This is an Article I court, this Court has held. And Congress has created very specific appellate review procedures for this court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the special trial judge has no tenure, does she?
03-184 +++$+++ 5753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. He -- those judges could be terminated at will, including because there is not sufficient work for the judge. They can be terminated on that basis. And that, we think, colors the analysis here for the reasons Judge Cudahy gave. This is not an independent judge. When he is persuaded by his superior to change his mind, it's obvious that he -- in our view, that he's going to be heavily influenced by that. It's a serious Raddatz problem. The only cure is to make this part of the record and to enforce the rule 183 presumption of correctness, which creates a clear error standard of review. I see my time has run out. May I reserve the rest for --
03-184 +++$+++ 5754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, you may, of course. Mr. Hungar.
03-184 +++$+++ 5756 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The central flaw in petitioners' case is that both of the trial court judges responsible for evaluating the evidence in the record reached the same conclusion regarding all of the factual issues.
03-184 +++$+++ 5757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Hungar, before you proceed to your legal argument, I was very curious why the Government is defending this practice because the Government, after all, is on the other side of every case. And aren't there situations where it might be that the special trial judge would call a credibility question in the Government's favor and then the Government loses the case before the Tax Court judge and might like to know, before it goes to the court of appeals, how solid the credibility findings were? I mean, I -- I -- the Government being a party to all these proceedings, why is it satisfied with not knowing what the report of the special tax judge -- special trial judge was?
03-184 +++$+++ 5758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, we do know what the report of the special trial judge was. It is in the record. Judge Couvillion's name is on his report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it is not the report. It is called an opinion. It isn't even called the report, and if you will read 183(b), that describes the report. Does anything else describe the report? And what is this report? There is a report. It is submitted to the chief judge. What would you call that?
03-184 +++$+++ 5760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The report is the -- contains the recommended findings of fact and opinion, analysis of the law and application of the law to the fact, of the special trial judge. The report is the findings of fact plus, quote, the opinion.
03-184 +++$+++ 5761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, what is the 183(b) report?
03-184 +++$+++ 5762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-184 +++$+++ 5763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There --
03-184 +++$+++ 5764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- under rule 183(b), the -- the special trial judge submits his report to the chief judge. It is then referred to a Tax Court judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So that report, the special trial judge's report, is a document prepared by the special trial judge which he gives to the chief judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct. But the important thing to understand, Your Honor, is that nothing in the rule precludes, during the course of the deliberative process that then follows, the special trial judge from concluding that he has made a mistake, that he no longer agrees with the -- the stated findings of fact in that -- in that original report, from withdrawing and submitting a corrected report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that's not the way the rule reads. The rule reads, as I understand it, under (c) that the court itself may accept, reject, or modify. It doesn't say anything about the special trial judge reconsidering and rewriting his report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't preclude it either, Your Honor. There's a longstanding practice --
03-184 +++$+++ 5769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, it does because it -- it goes on to say that due regard shall be given to the circumstance that the special trial judge had the opportunity to evaluate and the findings of fact recommended by the special trial judge shall be presumed to be correct. But if those findings of fact are simply the same findings of fact that he agrees with the rest of the -- the panel on, it just makes no sense at all.
03-184 +++$+++ 5770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The Tax Court judge cannot report in -- in the opinion that is issued by the Tax Court, he cannot say I'm adopting the opinion and findings of the special trial judge if the -- if the Tax Court judge does not agree with those and the -- and the special trial judge adheres to his original decision. The only way it is possible for there to be a change is for the special trial judge himself to determine, in the exercise of his responsibility as a judicial officer, that he made a mistake.
03-184 +++$+++ 5771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What report goes to the chief judge?
03-184 +++$+++ 5772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Originally the original report goes to the chief judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a report. Is that not a report?
03-184 +++$+++ 5774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is a report, Your Honor.
03-184 +++$+++ 5775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why doesn't that -- why isn't that required to be -- to be made public?
03-184 +++$+++ 5776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because if -- because the -- because the Tax Court has determined that it will not be made public, that it is part of internal deliberation.
03-184 +++$+++ 5777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's a report. The statute says that the reports have to be made public.
03-184 +++$+++ 5778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor.
03-184 +++$+++ 5779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is a report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor.
03-184 +++$+++ 5781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it goes to the --
03-184 +++$+++ 5782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor.
03-184 +++$+++ 5783 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No?
03-184 +++$+++ 5784 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With respect, the tax -- the -- the statute says a report of the Tax Court must be made public. A -- a report --
03-184 +++$+++ 5785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but the rule -- the rule says that the first report, the document 1, has to be given deference. Whether it's presumed to be correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Kennedy, if I may, I'd like first to finish my response to Justice Scalia.
03-184 +++$+++ 5787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure.
03-184 +++$+++ 5788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The statutes -- the -- the disclosure requirement applies only to reports of the Tax Court. It is perfectly clear that a report, the original report, or any report of a special trial judge is not and cannot be the report of the Tax Court unless it is first adopted and approved by a Tax Court judge, and then goes through the next step of -- of being submitted --
03-184 +++$+++ 5789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's -- it's very hard to understand how appellate review can function if that first report of the special trial judge is never disclosed. I just don't see how the appellate review can function properly.
03-184 +++$+++ 5790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And how do we know that it was -- that it was presumed to be correct under the rule?
03-184 +++$+++ 5791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. How does the appellate court know whether deference, as required by the rules, was given unless the appellate court can see it? It's such a strange procedure. Why, in answer to Justice Ginsburg, does the government take the view it does? Wouldn't you like to see it if it went against you?
03-184 +++$+++ 5792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We submit, Your Honor, that there is no evidentiary or probative value in an initial conclusion that the -- that the person who reached that conclusion has abandoned, has concluded was wrong. Special Trial Judge --
03-184 +++$+++ 5793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the rule --
03-184 +++$+++ 5794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- Couvillion rejected --
03-184 +++$+++ 5795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the rule -- the rule 183 does provide for a certain degree of deference to be given to those findings of the special trial judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To the recommended findings of the special trial judge. And I submit that if the special trial judge has concluded that his initial recommendations were mistaken because, based upon further consideration as a judicial officer in the exercise of his obligations, he has realized he made a mistake, I submit it would be bizarre to require a Tax Court judge to give some sort of -- of deference to --
03-184 +++$+++ 5797 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Hungar, do you --
03-184 +++$+++ 5798 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- abandoned findings.
03-184 +++$+++ 5799 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you see somewhat of a problem, that we are not dealing here with the relationship between peers? Judge Dawson is appointed, what, for a 15-year term. The special trial judge is appointed by the Tax Court and his job is at the Tax Court's grace. And if you have compared in your brief that relationship to, say, a discussion among colleagues, I think it's worlds different.
03-184 +++$+++ 5800 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, Judge Dawson actually is a senior judge who was recalled. So he doesn't have the 15-year term protection. But it's true that special trial judges are -- are appointed by the chief judge, not by the Tax Court judges, but by the chief judge, so that Judge Dawson wasn't, in a sense, his -- his appointing, employing official. But more to the point, special --
03-184 +++$+++ 5801 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He has had a special -- a -- a long term and he is well-known and respected as a Tax Court judge who was appointed, as all other members of the court were appointed.
03-184 +++$+++ 5802 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Judge Couvillion has been a special trial judge, I think, for nearly 20 years. But the point is special trial judges are bound by the code of conduct. The Tax Court has adopted for both Tax Court judges and special trial judges the same code of conduct that applies to Federal judges under Article III, which --
03-184 +++$+++ 5803 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me --
03-184 +++$+++ 5804 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- obligates independent decision-making.
03-184 +++$+++ 5805 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me that it's very much like, if you have to compare it with something, the relationship between a magistrate and a Federal district court judge. The magistrate also hears testimony, makes a report, findings, and a recommendation. What's the difference between those two?
03-184 +++$+++ 5806 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, one difference is that the district court judges, as I understand it, appoint the magistrate, not the chief judge. But a more significant difference is that the statute and rules applicable to magistrates require disclosure of their reports and do not treat them as part of the internal deliberative process. The Tax Court has determined that it is inefficient to have disclosure of the original report, then have exceptions and have that whole process followed that they used to follow. They have determined that they will treat the Tax Court -- excuse me -- the special trial judge's report --
03-184 +++$+++ 5807 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So where does it say that? Where does it say that?
03-184 +++$+++ 5808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're not requiring the -- this case doesn't involve the question of whether they can make objections to the finding in -- in the special report. It's just whether it's disclosed.
03-184 +++$+++ 5809 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. But the -- but the Tax Court has determined not to disclose it.
03-184 +++$+++ 5810 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I understand. But your argument about how it would make the proceeding more cumbersome, it seems to me, is -- is misplaced.
03-184 +++$+++ 5811 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it certainly would be more cumbersome if they followed the procedure that they used to follow, which we submit, although the record is -- they did not specifically state --
03-184 +++$+++ 5812 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But they're not asking for that. Am -- am I wrong on --
03-184 +++$+++ 5813 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, that's true, Your Honor. What they're asking for here, what they say they want is merely disclosure of the original report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5814 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it's a particularly strong argument in a case -- in several of the issues. I remember Judge Fromm's opinion turned on the credibility of oral testimony, and in one case, Judge Fromm found the -- the judge here made an erroneous ruling on credibility on one issue, if I remember correctly. And it seems to me that's a case in which it would be particularly relevant to know the reasons pro and con on why credibility determinations were made by the person who heard the witnesses.
03-184 +++$+++ 5815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the person who heard the witnesses is Special Trial Judge Couvillion.
03-184 +++$+++ 5816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Has been convinced that he was wrong.
03-184 +++$+++ 5817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the question is, well, what was his -- what was the basis for his original position when you're evaluating whether you've got a valid argument to make on appeal?
03-184 +++$+++ 5819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Under that rationale, Justice Stevens, every time a district court judge changes his mind, after giving further thought to a case --
03-184 +++$+++ 5820 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no.
03-184 +++$+++ 5821 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- before he issues his final opinion --
03-184 +++$+++ 5822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Only if he is required by a rule to make certain findings and to deliver a completed report to someone else.
03-184 +++$+++ 5823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, again, the -- the rule does not preclude the practice. It is a common practice --
03-184 +++$+++ 5824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't forbid it. You're right. It doesn't forbid it in so many words. But I just wonder, does it comport with your normal notions of a fair way to conduct a fair hearing, letting the parties know what the basis for decision was and who thought what about the witnesses and so forth?
03-184 +++$+++ 5825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor. If the -- in a -- when a -- when a court has a collegial deliberative process involving more than one person that is involved in the decision-making -- certainly this is an unusual process in that -- and there is no identical analog, but we see no due process problem.
03-184 +++$+++ 5826 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. But I don't see what is consistent with your notion of a deliberative process as producing the report and the presumption of correctness in the rule. The rule presumes that some original document, which you are treating as provisional, enjoys a presumption of correctness, and I don't see the consistency between provisionality and deliberate character on the one hand and presumption on the other.
03-184 +++$+++ 5827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I may, Your Honor, the rule does not state that the, quote, original report shall receive a presumption of correctness. It doesn't even say that -- that any report shall receive a presumption of correctness. It says the findings of fact recommended by the special trial judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And aren't those findings of fact the findings of fact that are delivered to the chief judge in the report that is made to the chief judge before it is even assigned to a Tax Court judge?
03-184 +++$+++ 5829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not if -- not if the tax -- if the special trial judge has abandoned those recommendations, withdrawn those recommendations, and replaced them.
03-184 +++$+++ 5830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But he hasn't abandoned them at the point that he delivers them to the chief judge, and if that's what this is referring to, then the presumption of the -- of -- of correctness necessarily has to apply to whatever the document is that's delivered to the chief judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it applies to the report, but I submit that if the special trial judge withdraws in order to correct an error in the report, what he submits as the corrected report is then the, quote, report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're -- you're --
03-184 +++$+++ 5833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why isn't that explained in the rules, if that's the process?
03-184 +++$+++ 5834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- have a condition subsequent. It seems to me that you're saying, Mr. Hungar, that the last sentence of 183 is unenforceable.
03-184 +++$+++ 5835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the credibility -- the due regard and presumption of --
03-184 +++$+++ 5836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The presumption.
03-184 +++$+++ 5837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's important to understand also that, in fact, it would violate the Internal Revenue Code. This rule must be construed to be consistent with the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Code makes very clear, and this Court held in Freytag, that the Tax Court judge, not the special trial judge, is the decision-maker, the only finder of fact in these kinds of cases under subsection (b)(4) of the statute. This Court so held in Freytag and the -- and the statute makes that very clear. So it would violate the statute to construe this, as petitioners do, to require some sort of deferential clear error review.
03-184 +++$+++ 5838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you're saying the rule itself in that respect is invalid?
03-184 +++$+++ 5839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If construed as petitioners would have it, yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, how else could you possibly construe it? There's no presumption operating at all on your reading.
03-184 +++$+++ 5841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In the tax context, Your Honor, the -- there is a presumption of correctness that attaches to assessments and deficiency notices issued by --
03-184 +++$+++ 5842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but you're saying there is -- there is no presumption of correctness that can operate with respect to the report that goes first to the chief judge because, I understood you to say, to do that would violate the Internal Revenue Code provision that the fact-finder and the only fact-finder is the Tax Court judge. And therefore, I think the implication of what you're saying is that the rule on its face is invalid.
03-184 +++$+++ 5843 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, presumption of correctness does not necessarily equate with clear error, deferential review. That's my point.
03-184 +++$+++ 5844 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm -- I'm not even getting to whatever the standard of review may be. I presume the word presumption means something other than it's there unless you want to change it later after the person who employs you objects to it. It's got to mean something more than that.
03-184 +++$+++ 5845 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What the presumption of correctness means in the tax context, with respect to deficiency determinations and the like, is that the burden of going forward is on the party seeking to change what -- what -- the determination that is presumed correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5846 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there's no party who is seeking to change at this point because the parties don't know what's in it. They're not going forward. This is, as you point out, an internal process that is going on here. So that definition can't apply.
03-184 +++$+++ 5847 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. If -- there -- there are two processes that go on. The Tax Court judge, quite appropriately, we -- we assume and have -- have no reason to disagree, confers with, discusses with the special trial judge. If -- if in the course of that discussion, one or both of them come to the conclusion that something is wrong in the original report and if the special trial judge agrees, the special trial judge has the option of withdrawing his original report, submitting a corrected report, and having the presumption of correctness, whatever it means, apply to his corrected report. If -- if --
03-184 +++$+++ 5848 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In -- in that discussion, does the Tax Court judge have to give great weight to the findings of fact of the -- of the special judge?
03-184 +++$+++ 5849 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor, not great weight because, again, that would violate the statute.
03-184 +++$+++ 5850 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Any weight?
03-184 +++$+++ 5851 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He is to give due -- the due regard provision we think is essentially precatory, as the -- as the Seventh Circuit said. It reminds the -- the Tax Court judge that he should not lightly set aside the credibility determinations. But again, that's not what happened here.
03-184 +++$+++ 5852 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So I -- I think your -- I think your answer then is not that this is invalid. It is simply unenforceable. It is precatory language, looks okay, but there's no way to police it.
03-184 +++$+++ 5853 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's certainly not enforceable in an appellate court. That's correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5854 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Judicially it cannot be enforced.
03-184 +++$+++ 5855 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, because otherwise it would violate the statute if it imposed some meaningful limitation. But again, it's important to understand here the Tax Court judge did not exercise his authority in this case to reverse or set aside the special trial judge's findings. He could have done so --
03-184 +++$+++ 5856 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do they -- do they ever? I mean, this -- this says, this decision -- it's labeled -- the -- the court agrees with and adopts the opinion of the special trial judge. Are there Tax Court cases where the Tax Court says, instead of that, the court modifies the decision of the special trial judge or the court rejects, in whole or in part, the report of the special trial judge?
03-184 +++$+++ 5857 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We cite --
03-184 +++$+++ 5858 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do Tax Court opinions come out that way?
03-184 +++$+++ 5859 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We cite in footnote 4 a small number of cases from prior to the last rule change in which that occurred. In addition, there are at least a couple of cases since the rule change in which the Tax Court judge rejected parts of the opinion, but not the findings. We're not aware of any cases in which the Tax Court judge has rejected the findings, but there are other cases -- Little against Commissioner, 103 T.C. 285; Walker against Commissioner, 101 T.C. 537 -- in which the Tax Court judge expressed a disagreement with a portion of the opinion of the special trial judge and then proceeded to decide the case in the manner he or she thought --
03-184 +++$+++ 5860 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because if one were just to rule this -- read this rule straight: first, the report that goes to the chief judge, and then it says that the Tax Court judge may modify it, reject it in whole -- adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part. You would expect, if we were having truth in labeling, that whenever, with consultation, without, there's a difference between the two documents, the Tax Court judge, in combination with the special trial judge or without, would say, action on the report -- action on the report, which is the special trial judge's report, is it is modified or it is rejected or it is rejected in part. I mean --
03-184 +++$+++ 5861 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, again, that assumes that the -- that the -- the rule compels the interpretation that the special trial judge is prohibited from withdrawing, correcting, and resubmitting his report. I submit it does not compel that interpretation, and the Tax Court --
03-184 +++$+++ 5862 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The rule -- the rule doesn't say anything about this consultation that you've described. And if that's the Tax Court's procedure, why isn't it laid out in the rules so everyone can see it instead of being deceived by reading here is the special trial judge's report, and now what the Tax Court will do is either adopt, modify, or reject in whole or in part?
03-184 +++$+++ 5863 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think it -- I mean, I don't think it's -- it's deceitful, the -- the possibility that a court --
03-184 +++$+++ 5864 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Misleading. Because when I just read this rule cold, that's what I assumed, that we have the initial report and then it goes to the Tax Court judge, and that judge does something with it, and that something may be adopt, it may be modify, it may be reject in whole or in part.
03-184 +++$+++ 5865 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, when the Tax Court adopted its present procedures in 1984, it -- it certainly did not do so in as artful a manner as it could have. But the question is whether it violates the statute or due process for it to do what it has done. Let me just -- we've been spending most of our time talking about this issue of whether the Tax Court -- the special trial judge is permitted to change his report under rule 183. That's not even one of the questions in the questions presented. The only rule 183 question in the questions presented is whether the rule requires clear error review. We submit the answer to that is no because it would violate the Internal Revenue Code. So this -- this question about whether the report permits -- whether the rule permits the report to be changed isn't even one of the questions presented. The courts of appeals upheld the judgment on the premise that it was permissible for the Tax Court judge and the trial -- the special trial judge to engage in the deliberative process and for the special trial judge to revise his findings as he did --
03-184 +++$+++ 5866 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think there's any -- any question they can change the report, but the one -- the one -- I'd like to ask you a question as a matter of information. The first sentence of 183(c) refers to the possibility that the judge to whom the case is assigned may direct the filing of additional briefs to receive further evidence and oral argument. Does it ever happen that before the judge to whom it's assigned decides whether or not to go along with the recommended findings, that he will direct oral argument? Does that ever happen?
03-184 +++$+++ 5867 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't know the answer to that, Your Honor. I'm not aware of that, but --
03-184 +++$+++ 5868 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because if he did, it would seem almost necessary for him to disclose to the parties what the report they're arguing about would say.
03-184 +++$+++ 5869 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Again, I -- this is a holdover from the prior version of the rule in which the exceptions process was followed, and again, it may be that had the Tax Court given it further consideration, they might have viewed that unnecessary. But we're not aware of that happening.
03-184 +++$+++ 5870 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it certainly seems to contemplate deliberation by the judge to whom the case is assigned about whether or not to accept the report and deliberation which might be informed from input -- input from the parties. That's a fair reading of the rule, I think.
03-184 +++$+++ 5871 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If --
03-184 +++$+++ 5872 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Maybe it's not practiced.
03-184 +++$+++ 5873 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- if the Tax Court judge so determines, yes. The rule certainly allows that, but it doesn't obviously require that.
03-184 +++$+++ 5874 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if he did then ask for further briefings, do you think that there would then have been a requirement to disclose the report?
03-184 +++$+++ 5875 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, presumably it would be a waste of everyone's time unless he -- I don't know that he would have to disclose the report, but he would need to direct their attention to the issue he would like them to brief.
03-184 +++$+++ 5876 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me that the author of this subsection (c) must have contemplated the possibility of disclosure of the report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5877 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, again, Your Honor, this language was adopted at a time when they followed the exception --
03-184 +++$+++ 5878 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ When they followed a different procedure, and the question is to how much -- how much did they intend the -- to change that prior procedure.
03-184 +++$+++ 5879 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we know that the Tax Court has interpreted its rule to permit precisely the practice it followed here because it said so. And it would be quite extraordinary, we submit, for this Court to reverse the Tax Court, which is surely entitled to considerable deference in interpreting its own rules, since, after all, the Tax Court has exclusive statutory authority to promulgate its own rules, and particularly with respect to this issue about whether the special trial judge can change his report, since that was not even one of the questions presented. If I may turn to -- back to the statutory question. Section 7461 requires disclosure of reports of the Tax Court. The special trial judge report is not the report of the Tax Court. Indeed, even a Tax Court judge's opinion and report does not become the report of the Tax Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5880 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does the statute you just quoted prohibit the disclosure of other reports if we call this first draft something other than a report?
03-184 +++$+++ 5881 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The statute doesn't --
03-184 +++$+++ 5882 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, would -- would the rule go further than the statute?
03-184 +++$+++ 5883 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The statute does not prohibit the disclosure of other reports, but the rule clearly does not require the disclosure of reports. The Tax Court in 1984 amended the rule to make perfectly clear that -- that initial reports of special trial judges are not to be disclosed. The Tax Court said in its orders in this case the reason for that is that those are now internal deliberative processes. The Tax Court has made clear that its rules permit exactly what it's doing here.
03-184 +++$+++ 5884 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Hungar, you started to say that -- that even the opinion of a -- of a Tax Court judge is not a report of the Tax Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5885 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-184 +++$+++ 5886 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How does that work?
03-184 +++$+++ 5887 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Page 2a of the appendix to the gray brief, at the bottom of the page, section 7460(b) provides that the report of the division -- and the Tax Court is now and has for many years been divided into one-judge divisions. They used to sit en banc or --
03-184 +++$+++ 5888 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I was -- I was going to ask you what -- what 7461 referred to when it says the Tax Court and its divisions.
03-184 +++$+++ 5889 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-184 +++$+++ 5890 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It also is referred to there.
03-184 +++$+++ 5891 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ For a brief period of time, they sat in -- in panels.
03-184 +++$+++ 5892 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I see.
03-184 +++$+++ 5893 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But they -- the -- the press of work force them to -- to divide into one-judge divisions.
03-184 +++$+++ 5894 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it's a single judge is a division of the Tax Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5895 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, that's correct.
03-184 +++$+++ 5896 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the publicity of proceedings does say -- it does say that all reports of the Tax Court --
03-184 +++$+++ 5897 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
03-184 +++$+++ 5898 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And all evidence received by the Tax Court and its divisions, meaning its single judges. Well, what happens with -- with a single judge's opinion?
03-184 +++$+++ 5899 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He -- he prepares it and submits it to the chief judge under rule -- under statute -- under the statute 7460(b) where it says the report of the division shall become the report of the Tax Court within 30 days after such report by the division, unless the chief judge directs it to be reviewed by the full court. So -- so even a Tax Court judge's opinion is not the report of the Tax Court. Surely the report of the special trial judge is not either.
03-184 +++$+++ 5900 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's like an en banc. I -- I have written decisions for a panel in my years on the court of appeals, and there's been an en banc and my opinion gets vacated. It's no longer counts for anything. And isn't that exactly what the Tax Court is? They have the --
03-184 +++$+++ 5901 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. The -- the opinion is not made public. In fact, the statute precludes it from being made -- made a part of the record. The last sentence of that same section 7460(b) at the top of page 3a, it says the report of a division shall not be a part of the record in any case in which the chief judge directs that such report shall be reviewed by the Tax Court. And that's a very important point. Congress has mandated by statute essentially the same procedure that the Tax Court follows here.
03-184 +++$+++ 5902 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, no. No, no, no. How often, when there is a decision reviewed by the court, so that the initial judge's decision is changed, does that judge dissent, so all the world knows what that judge's initial position was?
03-184 +++$+++ 5903 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the Tax Court judge certainly has the authority to dissent, just as a special trial judge has the authority and, indeed, the obligation under the code of conduct to refuse to put his name on a -- on a report if he doesn't agree with it. If he doesn't agree with the Tax Court judge's view, he has the obligation, the ethical obligation -- and we presume he follows it -- to say I don't agree. This is my report. If you --
03-184 +++$+++ 5904 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then he -- then he can publish his -- he can publish his dissent, just as a Tax Court judge can?
03-184 +++$+++ 5905 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but he can preclude the Tax Court judge from doing what the Tax Court judge did in this case, which is simply adopting his report. If the -- if the special trial judge refuses to change his report --
03-184 +++$+++ 5906 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But then we still won't know what his report is. Yes, he can say, I won't sign this. Tax Court says, fine. This rule says I can reject your findings in whole or in part. I don't need your name on this decision of the Tax Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5907 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, if -- if that were the case here, obviously our arguments would be more difficult. But that is not what happened here. If -- if --
03-184 +++$+++ 5908 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm asking you just as the -- the judge who disagrees with the -- the full court can publish his dissent, can the special trial judge who disagrees with the Tax Court judge publish his dissent?
03-184 +++$+++ 5909 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In the -- the one case involving a change in the opinion, where the Tax Court judge said, I don't adopt a portion of the opinion of the special trial judge, there was no published opinion of the special trial judge. So I don't believe there's a procedure for the dissent. But the point is the court of appeals --
03-184 +++$+++ 5910 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Has there ever been? Has there ever been?
03-184 +++$+++ 5911 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ A published dissent by a special trial judge? Not that I'm aware of. But the point is the court of --
03-184 +++$+++ 5912 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And how -- how often does the -- is there a dissent when there's -- when there's a full court review decision?
03-184 +++$+++ 5913 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there's often a dissent. It's -- it's hard to know from the standpoint of a researcher when -- when it is that the judge who heard the evidence and tried the case is the one who's dissenting, unless they happen to say it in their opinion, because again, there's no original opinion issued by the Tax Court judge who first heard the case. That's kept confidential by statute, which again is an important point. Congress has mandated confidentiality of the initial reports prepared even by Tax Court judges, and it has given the Tax Court plenary authority to promulgate rules governing special trial judges. It is hardly surprising, let alone impermissible under the statute or Due Process Clause, for the Tax Court to follow a similar process for special trial judges.
03-184 +++$+++ 5914 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Except that the -- the relationship between the -- the one judge and the full Tax Court is a relationship basically of people who are in the same boat with respect to what they know about or can know about law and what they can know about the evidence and the facts of the case; whereas the relationship between the special trial judge and the judge to whom it is assigned is -- is quite different because only one of them has heard evidence and only one of them is the source of conclusion about fact.
03-184 +++$+++ 5915 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. It's identical. The -- the full Tax Court --
03-184 +++$+++ 5916 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It certainly is not identical in -- in the sense that the -- the Tax Court judge then goes and listens to evidence. He doesn't. That's the whole point.
03-184 +++$+++ 5917 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, neither does the full Tax Court when it --
03-184 +++$+++ 5918 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Neither does the full Tax Court, but if the full Tax Court is disagreeing with one judge, the one judge and the full Tax Court are in the same boat. They have access to the same material. Their limits are exactly the same in each case. That is not true in the relationship between the single Tax Court judge and the special Tax Court judge. The special Tax Court judge is the only one who has heard evidence and can find facts based upon the evidence that he heard.
03-184 +++$+++ 5919 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. The -- the tax -- the full Tax Court doesn't go back and -- and hold a new trial, just like the individual Tax Court judges --
03-184 +++$+++ 5920 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I am quite aware of that. That's not -- that's not the point. I'm -- I'm saying that you cannot draw an analogy between one judge and full Tax Court and use that as an analogy to legitimize the relationship between one judge and a trial master. They are in different positions. They are not in parallel positions.
03-184 +++$+++ 5921 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, then if -- if I understand the point you're making, it's a point of the -- the -- it's the hierarchy issue, if that's -- if that's the point you're making.
03-184 +++$+++ 5922 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's the knowledge issue. The special Tax Court judge heard somebody.
03-184 +++$+++ 5923 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So did the Tax Court judge --
03-184 +++$+++ 5924 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Nobody on the Tax Court did.
03-184 +++$+++ 5925 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. That's incorrect.
03-184 +++$+++ 5926 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, they're -- they're sitting hearing witnesses? They are -- they are redoing the trial? Surely not.
03-184 +++$+++ 5927 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, in a review -- if a Tax Court judge -- most Tax Court cases are tried by Tax Court judges. Tax Court judges are trial judges, and if a Tax Court judge tries a case --
03-184 +++$+++ 5928 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But we are talking about situations in which the trial judge is the special judge.
03-184 +++$+++ 5929 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm talking about the full Tax Court, Your Honor. If the full Tax Court reviews an individual Tax Court judge's decision, the Tax Court judge has presided over the trial, heard the evidence, just like the special trial judge here, and then the full Tax Court judge reviews it. That's exactly what happened in the Estate of Varian case, which is in our briefs, out of the Ninth Circuit. The parties complained that they wanted access to the original judge's report because he had been reversed -- been reversed by the full court after trial on an -- on an evidentiary issue, and the Ninth Circuit said no.
03-184 +++$+++ 5930 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Hungar, I think we understand your answer.
03-184 +++$+++ 5931 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HUNGAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you.
03-184 +++$+++ 5932 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Shapiro, you have about 4 minutes left.
03-184 +++$+++ 5934 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The question came up whether rule 183 forbids disclosure of this report. The answer is it does not forbid disclosure of the report. It is silent on the point. But the press release the Tax Court issued in 1983, coming from the chief judge of the court, said that this simply meant that it would not automatically be disclosed.
03-184 +++$+++ 5935 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why does 7461 require its -- its disclosure? Because it does say that the -- it's only the decision of the Tax Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5936 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-184 +++$+++ 5937 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That reports of the Tax Court that have to be disclosed.
03-184 +++$+++ 5938 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our view is that of -- of the Tax Court means any report emanating from the Tax Court. That's the literal meaning of that language. It doesn't mean final.
03-184 +++$+++ 5939 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that -- that would mean that -- that you would have to make public the -- the reports of a regular Tax Court judge in cases that then go on to the full court. And that's not done, is it?
03-184 +++$+++ 5940 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's an exception for the en banc situation because legal issues are addressed en banc, not the factual issues. And there's an opportunity to dissent.
03-184 +++$+++ 5941 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but it doesn't matter. It would still be a report of the Tax Court if you don't take that language literally. If you say any report coming out of the institution is a report of the Tax Court, you would have to make public the reports of the individual Tax Court judges, which is not done.
03-184 +++$+++ 5942 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, we say there's a special statute dealing with the en banc situation that -- that governs in that situation. And that the publicity --
03-184 +++$+++ 5943 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why is that? What -- what statute is that?
03-184 +++$+++ 5944 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that's the en banc provision that counsel referred to that said that when the case is heard en banc, the trial -- the -- the single judge's report is not made part of the record. Congress' assumption there was that there would be a new -- new report issued. People would be able to dissent if they disagreed. And this process focuses on legal issues. There is no presumption of correctness.
03-184 +++$+++ 5945 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's not a -- that's not a de novo -- they can rehear matters de novo on the en banc Tax Court, can they not? That's a de novo hearing.
03-184 +++$+++ 5946 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but it addresses legal issues. It's not a device to second guess factual determinations, and there's a special statute that deals with that, which does not apply to this STJ situation, where there's a presumption of correctness applicable to what the trial judge does. And there is the general disclosure statute that applies there.
03-184 +++$+++ 5947 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know if I'm getting -- so that's his basic point. The rule doesn't require the disclosure because they've interpreted it differently within their -- within their discretion. Statute doesn't require it and the Constitution doesn't require it. We have to go to the Constitution, I don't see exactly the implications. So I'm nervous. And now, the reports -- he says, go read 7460(b). That's what they're talking about. And then -- and again, I don't know what I'm getting into once I read it more broadly than that. And what about all evidence received by the Tax Court, including a transcript. Of course, this isn't evidence but neither is a transcript. And -- and so maybe that word evidence can be read more broadly, given the fact that it's to include a transcript of the stenographic report.
03-184 +++$+++ 5948 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think you're right, and --
03-184 +++$+++ 5949 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You think I'm right just suddenly for the for the first time? You have thought of this?
03-184 +++$+++ 5950 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I think that the intent of this provision -- and I know Your Honor consults the legislative history. The intent was to make all of the steps in the adjudicative process transparent, including the evidence, including the -- the stenographer's report, and all reports from the Tax Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5951 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's -- there's a very careful use of language. It says all reports of the Tax Court and all evidence received by the Tax Court and its divisions. So it's only the evidence that -- that's received by the individual judges has to be made public, not the reports.
03-184 +++$+++ 5952 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we believe that the word all is a broad, generic inclusive term that should be applied, as Judge Cudahy stated, to an STJ report that actually has to be submitted to the chief judge and that has legal effect. It's not just a casual document like a law clerk memorandum. It has legally operative effect. Congress' purpose here was very broad, to have transparency, applicable to all the steps along the way in the Tax Court. It was quite clear on that, that there are arbitrary actions at each step of the way. If you look at the Senate report and Congressman LaGuardia's statements, they said secrecy is a vicious practice in this context, and it -- it should be avoided.
03-184 +++$+++ 5953 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But we -- we don't have to get into any of that if we accept your argument about 7482(a)(1), that is, the record will be in the same manner and to the same extent as decisions of the district court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5954 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor. There -- there are three separate bases for ruling in our favor. One is the appellate review statute. The other is the disclosure statute. The third is due process. And due process should inform the construction of these statutes. This Court tries to avoid serious due process issues through its interpretation of legislation. Judge Cudahy suggested that was the right way to decide this case and we agree that it is. We thank the Court.
03-184 +++$+++ 5955 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Shapiro. The case is submitted.
03-287 +++$+++ 5959 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll now hear argument in Wilkinson against Dotson. Solicitor Cole.
03-287 +++$+++ 5961 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Prisoners typically want two things: first, to improve their conditions while in prison; and second, to get out of prison as quickly as possible. Respondents' claims here are not conditions claims. They do not seek a larger cell or better food while in prison. Rather, their claims are about getting out of prison. Traditional understandings of habeas would suggest that these release-driven claims lie there, not in section 1983, and this Court's decision in Heck confirms that this common sense answer is also the correct answer. In fact, Heck establishes two bars, each of which independently prevent respondents from using section 1983 to pursue their claims here. First, Heck establishes that civil actions under section 1983 cannot be used to collaterally attack State criminal judgments. Before a prisoner can advance a claim under section 1983 that would necessarily imply the invalidity of such a judgment, he must first show that it has been favorably terminated. And Edwards v. Balisok confirms that quasi-judicial administrative decisions regarding the duration of confinement count as criminal judgments for this purpose.
03-287 +++$+++ 5962 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it isn't just duration of -- of confinement. I mean, in -- in Balisok, what you had was a determination that the confinement would be definitely less as a result of the -- the good time scheme. The -- the gut notion behind Balisok was that what you were attacking would imply that the sentence itself was invalid because the conviction was and so on. We don't have that here. What we have here is a scheme that makes a -- a sentence that is imposed a more definite sentence. We know where in the range it's going to be reconsidered. And however that may be classified, it's not simply a Balisok situation.
03-287 +++$+++ 5963 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's arguably different than the good-time credits at issue in Balisok, as -- as Your Honor notes. However, I -- I would suggest that even with respect to good-time credits, often under many State systems, good-time credits have the dual effect of moving up the parole eligibility date, as well as potentially -- and in some States, it doesn't even have an effect on the --
03-287 +++$+++ 5964 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, but that had --
03-287 +++$+++ 5965 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- of the sentence.
03-287 +++$+++ 5966 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that had nothing to do with the rationale in Balisok, as I recall it. Isn't that correct?
03-287 +++$+++ 5967 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, the -- the Court -- that's -- that's correct, yes. And I guess what I'd -- I'd say is that what seemed to be driving the Court, though, was still the durational aspect of the sentence; that is, as the Court said in Muhammad, if a claim threatens no consequence for the duration of confinement, then that isn't a -- or that isn't a claim that should be brought in 1983.
03-287 +++$+++ 5968 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No -- no question. But the durational consequence in those cases was a definite consequence of longer duration, i.e., a sentence in the first place, a sentence not reduced by good time in -- in the second example. Here, there -- there is no such clear consequence. Here, the consequence is that there will simply be a period of time before a sentence already imposed will be reviewed to determine whether, in fact, it will be shortened or allowed to run. And that's different.
03-287 +++$+++ 5969 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not sure it is, Your Honor. Both of them are going to have definite durational consequences for confinement.
03-287 +++$+++ 5970 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No -- no question about that. At -- at the level of whether there is a durational consequence, they -- they both have it. I -- I grant you that.
03-287 +++$+++ 5971 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And, Your Honor, as far back as Preiser, this Court has noted that challenges to duration go to the very heart of habeas corpus. That's --
03-287 +++$+++ 5972 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The duration of -- of the sentence. And here, there's no implication at all that this sentence is in any way invalid, that the sentence itself or any portion of it is invalid because the parole would be a matter of administrative grace, but it doesn't -- the determination of parole eligibility or parole suitability does not go to the validity of the sentence in any way, shape, or manner. Does it?
03-287 +++$+++ 5973 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, a decision from a Federal court -- and I guess -- I think the answer to Your -- Your Honor's question is yes, it does. And the reason I say that is I think we need to look to the consequences of the Federal court decision that would follow from the claims that -- that the plaintiffs -- or I'm sorry -- the prisoners here are advancing. The State of Ohio has made individualized decisions with respect to each of these respondents that they should not again be considered for release from prison until 2005. The request -- the relief that they're requesting and the claims that they're bringing, if successful, would result in the Federal court undermining that State decision with regard to the length that they should be incarcerated. It goes directly to the -- the --
03-287 +++$+++ 5974 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't -- it doesn't shorten the length that they're going to be incarcerated. There -- there is no certainty that -- that if they win this action, they will be incarcerated for a lesser period, is there?
03-287 +++$+++ 5975 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely no certainty of that, Your Honor. But there is certainty --
03-287 +++$+++ 5976 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and there was in the other cases, wasn't there? In Balisok.
03-287 +++$+++ 5977 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I don't think so. I mean, prisoners could be released in the State of Washington before the terminus of their sentence. They might not -- it isn't as though they had to serve all the way till the end, less whatever good-time credits they had. They could easily be --
03-287 +++$+++ 5978 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but --
03-287 +++$+++ 5979 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- released prior to that time.
03-287 +++$+++ 5980 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, indeed, but the -- but -- but getting the good-time credits entitled them to be -- be released earlier. They might have been released even earlier still, but their entitlement to be released earlier was a consequence, wasn't it?
03-287 +++$+++ 5981 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was, Your Honor.
03-287 +++$+++ 5982 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And there is no entitlement to be released earlier as a consequence of this.
03-287 +++$+++ 5983 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We --
03-287 +++$+++ 5984 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You just get another hearing and maybe you will, maybe you won't.
03-287 +++$+++ 5985 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. You'll -- you'll just get another hearing. But an important note on that: you'll get another hearing, and you'll get another hearing sooner than the State has decided that you should get a hearing.
03-287 +++$+++ 5986 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's true. So it makes it possible that you'll get released earlier, but -- but there's no assurance you'll -- really, the crucial question for me, I think, is whether -- whether this could have been brought as a habeas action. Could this have been brought as a habeas action?
03-287 +++$+++ 5987 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, it could have been brought as a habeas action. If you look at the nature of their complaints, they're -- they're clearly in custody. Habeas would require custody and violation of the Constitution of the United States.
03-287 +++$+++ 5988 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But they're just asking for a new hearing. They're not asking for an earlier release. What's your closest case that -- that would allow a habeas action which does not seek an earlier release but just -- just a hearing?
03-287 +++$+++ 5989 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think probably the Garlotte case, Your Honor, in which the Court allowed a habeas challenge where the only result was going to be to advance the date of eligibility for release from prison incarceration.
03-287 +++$+++ 5990 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. But it -- No, go on.
03-287 +++$+++ 5991 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it -- it doesn't advance the date of eligibility. It advances the date at which the parole board will take another look. The only eligibility is an eligibility to take -- to have another look taken and not an eligibility for release.
03-287 +++$+++ 5992 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true, Your Honor, but these -- under that understanding of eligibility, where eligibility means the first possible release date. But these prisoners are not eligible for release in the sense of it's not going to happen for them unless and until the next release hearing.
03-287 +++$+++ 5993 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if they are subject to another look, they are not necessarily then eligible for release. And I think that's the point that we're getting -- let me -- let me ask a -- a sort of complementary question. Is there any reason that these --
03-287 +++$+++ 5994 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is this with an I or an E?
03-287 +++$+++ 5995 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I was hoping for an I, yes.
03-287 +++$+++ 5996 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With an I or an E?
03-287 +++$+++ 5997 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With an E. With an E. But if -- if you take my questioning as a compliment with an I, that's perfectly okay too. (Laughter.)
03-287 +++$+++ 5998 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'll -- I'll wait and see what the question is --
03-287 +++$+++ 5999 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let's see what it is. The -- the question is, could these claims not have been brought in advance of any application to these particular prisoners of the revised -- whatever they were -- the 1998 guidelines? And if the answer is yes, then they could be brought at a time when, I suppose, habeas would -- would not have been a possible remedy. Is -- is -- am I correct on those two points?
03-287 +++$+++ 6000 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The State concedes that if they had brought this case before a parole hearing at which the guidelines were applied, that it would be a different case, and that 1983 would be a remedy in that -- in that situation.
03-287 +++$+++ 6001 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Here's -- here's the difficulty that I -- that I have. When I read your brief, I thought, well, he must be right because this is really about custody. It's really about custody. They want to get out eventually. But then when I -- I -- when I went back to Balisok, I thought, oh, here's the problem. The problem is that it's a damage remedy in Balisok. And normally you want the person to go into 1983 to get damages. But he's going to get mixed up. When do you send him to habeas? Well, we don't want to send him to habeas unless it's clear that habeas should have been brought. And so if he's just challenging, for example, introduction of Fourth Amendment violation evidence or something like that, don't got to habeas. Don't go to habeas. You didn't have to go to habeas unless you had to, unless you had -- unless it was necessary to upset the conviction. You see? That's why that language is there. Now, I got that far. Then I said, oh, I see what you do. We should have one rule for damages. Well, that makes sense. But there's no reason not to have a different rule when you have the injunctive action, and there maybe we could follow your rule. But the next thing I come across is a statement that says, no, no, the rule is the same whether you bring a damage action or whether you bring an injunctive or declaratory relief action. And I said, well, why did we write that? You know, we're the ones who caused all this trouble. But the -- the -- well, because we didn't want to make it too complicated and -- and not have all the questions coming, well, what kind of an action is it really, et cetera. Okay. So once I got that far, I said, oh, well, I'm going to have to change something for you to win. Either I have to change the thing that says the damages should be the same as the injunctive, or I have to change something else somewhere along the line, the word necessary. I don't want to change the word necessary. Maybe I could change the other, but why bother really? Because all that's important here is people know which way they should go. Now, that's where I am at the moment, thinking give him his 1983 action. It's simpler. It follows from Balisok. Why not?
03-287 +++$+++ 6002 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, there would be some real consequences that would follow from that.
03-287 +++$+++ 6003 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's what I thought.
03-287 +++$+++ 6004 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The reason that it's important that these cases go to habeas rather than 1983 is because of the State court exhaustion requirement that's attendant with habeas. Parole claims like those advanced here are often, if not always, intricately bound up with State law issues, and the State law is often going to provide much more meaningful relief than the Federal law claims that the prisoners advance.
03-287 +++$+++ 6005 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Doesn't the Prison Litigation Reform Act require exhaustion even in a 1983 action?
03-287 +++$+++ 6006 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but as Your Honor is aware, that's an administrative exhaustion requirement which this Court referred to in Nelson, I believe, as a substantially lower gate than the exhaustion requirement imposed by habeas. Moreover, it's telling --
03-287 +++$+++ 6007 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is -- may -- may I just follow up on that question? At the administrative level, cannot these State law policies perfectly well be taken into consideration? In other words, your argument was these things are bound up with State law issues and the best place to have them resolved is -- is in a State forum. They can be resolved in a State administrative forum, can't they?
03-287 +++$+++ 6008 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They could, Your Honor, but I -- I think the types of legal determinations with respect to legal entitlements and also the court -- we would assume a State court would also consider Federal claims that might be made by the prisoners when they bring their State court claim. Those types of legal claims are better resolved by State courts. They have the expertise to make the -- the determination. And in fact, in Ohio --
03-287 +++$+++ 6009 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, couldn't one say the same thing of prison conditions that you can bring in as a 1983 action? The States know better about how their prisons are operating and what changes would have to be made. So I -- I think that you -- you may be right that the State knows more about how its parole system operates, but so does it know more about how its prison system operates. And that doesn't -- that's not what determines whether you have 1983 or habeas.
03-287 +++$+++ 6010 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but Congress, with respect to conditions claims -- and if you look at the language of the administrative exhaustion requirement in the PLRA at 42 U.S.C. 1997(e)(a), it says no action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under 1983 without administrative exhaustion. So even Congress, in thinking about the PLRA and in thinking about requiring administrative exhaustion, understood that 1983 is really about conditions of confinement. 1983 isn't about -- it never has been about -- release. Habeas has traditionally been the relief that people -- or the cause of action that people bring when what they're interested in is relief -- or release from prison. And these claims, no one can dispute, are release-driven claims. They may not ultimately be successful in securing release, but the prisoners here --
03-287 +++$+++ 6011 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, no, I've got that part. But the -- and -- and you're right about that part. But that -- you know, that doesn't get over the -- the hump here I think because of the -- what we've written. The -- I mean, where I'm coming out now, what you've just said, is well, you know, there's going to be exhaustion in both cases. And prison conditions, if we say that habeas doesn't -- that 1983 applies here I think probably -- I can't guarantee it -- but those where prison conditions would then cover it, and then there would be exhaustion, and there -- where it doesn't seem to make difference there. And now I'm back to asking the other half of this, which is, well, all right, suppose I say I see your point, I think you're right. Now, what -- what is your recommendation? What do we change? Do we change the word necessary in Balisok, which I'd be pretty reluctant to do? Or do we drive a wedge between the damage cases and the injunctive/declaratory relief cases?
03-287 +++$+++ 6012 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think you need to do either, Your Honor. I think if we go back to Heck and look at the language there that talks about necessarily implying the invalidity of a criminal judgment, which is something --
03-287 +++$+++ 6013 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, well.
03-287 +++$+++ 6014 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- respondents concede in their brief, the only question then is does a parole decision count as a, quote, criminal --
03-287 +++$+++ 6015 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. No, but then what you're doing is taking the first half because what you're reading is you're reading that word necessary, whatever those words were in Balisok that we were just talking about, as your case satisfying that condition. And if your case satisfies that condition, then so does the case where a person wants to bring a damage action because of illegally seized evidence at his trial. Doesn't it? I mean, because all -- I mean -- and then we've swept -- then we've done -- we've really moved Balisok from what it was trying to do.
03-287 +++$+++ 6016 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think that's necessarily right, Your Honor, because the illegally seized evidence at the trial -- I don't know that that would necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction that resulted from that trial.
03-287 +++$+++ 6017 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why is he bringing his damage action? He thinks he's bringing it because what they did at that trial hurt me. Now, how did it hurt me? It hurt me because I went right to prison.
03-287 +++$+++ 6018 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, Your Honor, and that -- that's absolutely correct, but I'm not arguing for, and I want to make it very clear that I'm not arguing for any rule that would turn on the subjective intent of the prisoner in bringing their claim. It turns on the necessary implication of success on that claim, and that's a -- a distinction that the Court made both in Heck and in Balisok. They looked to what's the necessary implication. So we look to the claims here, not why they brought them, but what are the claims. And the claims here, and the particular ones that I would focus on, are the ex post facto claims. If the -- if they have success on their ex post facto claims -- and we don't believe their claims are meritorious, but if they're successful on those claims, there's no way the State's decision can stand. They are entitled to a new hearing at which they would again be considered for parole --
03-287 +++$+++ 6019 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but does that mean the -- the judgment -- the order denying release on parole is invalid? There are really two parts to it. One, you -- we're not going to release you. Secondly, your next hearing will be at a later date than you want. Insofar as you challenge the date of the hearing -- the date of the next hearing, does that necessarily imply the invalidity of the entire order denying parole?
03-287 +++$+++ 6020 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- we concede that if there's an ex post facto violation here, these prisoners are entitled to a new parole hearing. And I guess the --
03-287 +++$+++ 6021 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But they're not entitled to parole.
03-287 +++$+++ 6022 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor. Absolutely.
03-287 +++$+++ 6023 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that it doesn't totally invalidate the order that is at issue.
03-287 +++$+++ 6024 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the way that -- that I've been thinking about it is if you put the State parole decision up on the wall and you put the Federal decision up on the wall, one of them has to come down. The Federal decision trumps the State decision. It can --
03-287 +++$+++ 6025 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it doesn't entirely come down. It just -- half of it comes down.
03-287 +++$+++ 6026 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. The whole thing comes down, Your Honor. They're entitled both to an immediate new release hearing and --
03-287 +++$+++ 6027 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But not for release.
03-287 +++$+++ 6028 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- if they're successful on their claims, they're entitled to more frequent release hearings in the future. So the decision, the State's --
03-287 +++$+++ 6029 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but isn't it true that one aspect of your order that's under attack is they had refused to grant them parole?
03-287 +++$+++ 6030 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-287 +++$+++ 6031 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that remains.
03-287 +++$+++ 6032 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't, Your Honor. They have to decide that again. That -- that order is void ab initio. It's as though it were never entered. They have to make a new decision about whether or not this person should -- should have parole and that they cannot in any way -- the State cannot rely on the prior decision that they reached on that issue.
03-287 +++$+++ 6033 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought the only relief they were seeking was a more prompt next hearing.
03-287 +++$+++ 6034 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, they -- Dotson's complaint, I believe at page 20 of the joint appendix -- he wants to, quote, proceed toward a prompt and immediate parole hearing in accordance with the statutory laws and administrative rules in place when the plaintiff committed his crimes. They want an --
03-287 +++$+++ 6035 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But aren't -- aren't those claims moot or academic now? Because, as I understand it, he has had another parole hearing. So he's -- with the hearing that he was seeking, he's already had another. So he's not complaining about the absence of a hearing or -- or flaws in the procedure at the hearing. I thought that this case now reduces to a clean question about the retroactive application of the new guidelines.
03-287 +++$+++ 6036 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it isn't a clean question, Your Honor, because exactly the same error that he alleges infected his first hearing was present at his second hearing. If -- if you look at the materials that they added to their brief at lines 3, 7, and 8 where they have the new parole decision, it's clear that Dotson's 2002 parole decision was predicated on exactly the same guidelines, exactly the same 1998 guidelines that he says violated his rights under the Ex Post Facto Clause. So, in fact, if anything, it's made his situation worse because a Federal decision on his claims now would both necessarily imply the invalidity of his previous hearing and the 2002 hearing, and the 2002 hearing was a release hearing. Unlike the halfway review that occurred earlier, it was a full-fledged release hearing in 2002, at which the parole board decided both that he should not get parole then and that he should not again be considered for parole until 2005.
03-287 +++$+++ 6037 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was there -- maybe I'm wrong about this, but I thought there no challenge being made to the 2002 hearing.
03-287 +++$+++ 6038 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what Heck makes clear is it doesn't matter what you say you're challenging. What we need to look to is what's the necessary implication of securing success on your claims in Federal court for a State decision. Here, the necessary implication, if they're successful on their ex post facto claims, is going to be that the 2002 decision can't stand, the 1999 decision --
03-287 +++$+++ 6039 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why can't it simply be that prospectively for this class of prisoner, the old guidelines will apply, prospectively without undoing anything that's happened in the past?
03-287 +++$+++ 6040 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think for the same reason that in Balisok I don't think there could have been a prospective order that said -- said something like the method you have for choosing decision-makers creates fraud, bias, and deceit, on a going-forward basis you must change that method for selecting decision-makers. Saying that you have to change it on a going-forward basis would mean, necessarily imply, that there had been fraud, bias, and deceit by the decision-maker that would mean that --
03-287 +++$+++ 6041 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think twice you started something and our questions impeded you. But I think you were equating the parole board's decision to a criminal sentence, and so you -- you were saying just as the -- the Federal authority can't come in and nullify the State criminal sentence, neither can it nullify the parole board determination. And -- and I thought that the comparison between a -- a sentence -- a criminal conviction and sentence and a parole board's discretionary determination -- you seemed to be putting those on the same plane.
03-287 +++$+++ 6042 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not exactly on the same plane, Your Honor, but recognizing that this Court in Balisok said that post-judgment administrative decisions regarding the duration of confinement also count as criminal judgments that are protected for purposes of -- of the Heck doctrine. And in Greenholtz, this Court --
03-287 +++$+++ 6043 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but the -- the generality at which you keep referring to it, with respect to conditions of confinement, is a -- is a higher level of generality than anything that Balisok decided. In Balisok, the particular decision was a decision to revoke an entitlement to be released at whatever the date the good time would give, and -- and that is a much more specific -- I mean, that literally affects an entitlement to be released. It is not merely a decision with respect to length of confinement.
03-287 +++$+++ 6044 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, if this turns on whether or not it's an entitlement, I would agree with you that it seems good-time credits might be different from an entitlement sense than parole. But -- but all the way back, in tracing the cases from Preiser forward, the Court has talked about duration of confinement, and certainly no one can argue that the decision here is going to have dramatic consequences for the duration of these prisoners' confinement.
03-287 +++$+++ 6045 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- we don't know what consequence it will have for the duration of his confinement. All we know is that it will have a consequence in determining the date at which the next look will be taken by the parole board to see whether he then is in a condition to be released. That's all we can tell.
03-287 +++$+++ 6046 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor, but they're -- they're pressing ex post facto claims. And as this point -- Court pointed out in Garner in 2000, they can maybe bring those claims based on changes in frequency of parole hearings, but they're going to have to show a definite impact on the quantum of punishment that they receive as a result of that change. So if they're going to be successful on their ex post facto claims, they're going to have to show an impact on the duration of their confinement. Either they have no ex post facto claim because there's no durational impact on their --
03-287 +++$+++ 6047 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. But you're -- you're assuming -- your argument now is assuming that they are going to be successful on this element, that you say they've got to satisfy later.
03-287 +++$+++ 6048 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, but that's the Heck --
03-287 +++$+++ 6049 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and whether they are or not has nothing to do with -- with Balisok and Heck.
03-287 +++$+++ 6050 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I disagree, Your Honor, because in Heck and Balisok, the Court said look to what happens if they're successful on their claims. So I'm -- we're -- the State is supposed to hypothesize that somehow they're going to be successful on these claims. We don't agree it's going to happen, but once we hypothesize that they're going to be successful on an ex post facto claim, it means they're going to have to show, have to demonstrate a durational impact on their sentence.
03-287 +++$+++ 6051 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. It also -- it also means that if -- if -- assuming your argument is sound, if you lose this case, you win the war. (Laughter.)
03-287 +++$+++ 6052 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At -- at some level, I think there's an -- an inherent and fundamental tension in their position, and -- and the coin could flipped and conversely there's that same tension in ours.
03-287 +++$+++ 6053 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are -- are you sure that that's what they have to prove, that -- a durational impact? Wouldn't it be enough to show that they were deprived of an opportunity to have the sentence shorter? Wouldn't -- wouldn't it -- assuming there was an ex post facto violation, wouldn't that be enough of an injury, that they lost an opportunity to have their sentence shortened?
03-287 +++$+++ 6054 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, I believe what makes out the ex post facto claim is an increase in the quantum of punishment after they've committed their crimes. So they need to show that as an element. I -- I see -- I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, if I could.
03-287 +++$+++ 6055 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You may do so. Mr. Lewis.
03-287 +++$+++ 6057 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: This case presents a straightforward opportunity to apply the Heck rule. Respondent Johnson's section --
03-287 +++$+++ 6058 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can you tell us why -- why is it still live when they -- when they already received a second hearing? Or why is not moot?
03-287 +++$+++ 6059 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Johnson still has remaining claims for prospective injunctive relief in this case and, as well, declaratory relief. What may be mooted is his claim for retroactive injunctive relief, in other words, a new parole hearing. I think in order for him to pursue that type of a claim, he'd have to go back down to the district court.
03-287 +++$+++ 6060 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What -- what is --
03-287 +++$+++ 6061 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, put in plain language what it is Johnson is claiming he's entitled to. I don't understand.
03-287 +++$+++ 6062 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, he -- really three different things. He's requesting prospective injunctive relief, fix the due process violations that are going on in Ohio parole proceedings.
03-287 +++$+++ 6063 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which is a new -- a new parole hearing. Isn't -- I mean, it -- I --
03-287 +++$+++ 6064 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How could that be fixed?
03-287 +++$+++ 6065 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. How -- how can it be fixed except by giving him a new parole hearing?
03-287 +++$+++ 6066 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, he does have a class action. He filed a class action and he's trying to fix the proceeding prospectively. It doesn't necessarily require him to have a new parole hearing. He's still in confinement and will very likely have a new parole hearing, a new parole hearing that he wants the proceedings to be different in. He's not necessarily asking for a new parole hearing. He's saying --
03-287 +++$+++ 6067 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why isn't he? If -- if -- what he's saying is the past proceedings were invalid, I want you to do it right in the future.
03-287 +++$+++ 6068 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. I think that was part of his claim, which might be mooted, but he's also saying in any future --
03-287 +++$+++ 6069 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. It -- it isn't mooted because he still got it done wrong. The second hearing was still wrong.
03-287 +++$+++ 6070 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we don't --
03-287 +++$+++ 6071 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ His claims here -- if his claims here are correct.
03-287 +++$+++ 6072 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We don't know that for sure, but part of his claim as well is to say in future parole hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, even if you don't give me a new one, in future parole hearings that I'm going to be subjected to, I want these processes fixed to -- to come into compliance with due process. And I think that's separate and apart from --
03-287 +++$+++ 6073 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- you say we don't know whether the -- the new parole hearing he got was still invalid?
03-287 +++$+++ 6074 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think there's enough in the record to determine that.
03-287 +++$+++ 6075 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, so we can assume that that was valid. You're -- you're willing to assume that for purposes of this case?
03-287 +++$+++ 6076 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I am not willing to assume that. I -- I don't think we can say one way or the other.
03-287 +++$+++ 6077 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well,
03-287 +++$+++ 6078 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We can't yet.
03-287 +++$+++ 6079 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay, fine.
03-287 +++$+++ 6080 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We may intend to.
03-287 +++$+++ 6081 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then we take it as valid. Then we take it as valid. That's not a claim you're challenging. But I take it your claim is in the year 2009 he will have another hearing.
03-287 +++$+++ 6082 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Actually 2005.
03-287 +++$+++ 6083 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ 2005? Okay, 2005 he'll have another hearing.
03-287 +++$+++ 6084 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-287 +++$+++ 6085 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And in the year 2005, I want not to have the -- what are they called? The 1998 guidelines. I don't want my 1998 guidelines applied in the 2005 hearing because you have some theory, maybe good, maybe bad, but it's a theory that that would violate the Constitution of the United States.
03-287 +++$+++ 6086 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-287 +++$+++ 6087 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you're saying he's going to have this. I want an injunction or declaratory relief they can't do it.
03-287 +++$+++ 6088 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right, and as well, he says I want to be heard at this next parole hearing. Now, that was -- part of his due process allegations in this case were that he -- he wasn't even allowed to meaningfully participate in --
03-287 +++$+++ 6089 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And he's saying it violates the Constitution in two respects: one, they won't listen to me; and two, they apply the 1998 guidelines.
03-287 +++$+++ 6090 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's essentially it.
03-287 +++$+++ 6091 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's it. Okay. We're talking now about this 2005 hearing and he wants new procedures, and the question is, is this 1983 or is it habeas?
03-287 +++$+++ 6092 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's -- that's correct.
03-287 +++$+++ 6093 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
03-287 +++$+++ 6094 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and it is section 1983 because it doesn't violate the Heck rule. This --
03-287 +++$+++ 6095 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what -- what is your -- what is Johnson's mootness argument?
03-287 +++$+++ 6096 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, to the extent in his complaint he was seeking a new parole hearing as a result of the challenge to the '99 decision, that's probably mooted because he has received this 2001 hearing and we just don't know enough about it to know whether he's going to challenge it or not. He'd have to amend his complaint in the district court.
03-287 +++$+++ 6097 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could -- is it possible that both Dotson and Johnson could get new hearings by -- filing habeas --
03-287 +++$+++ 6098 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so.
03-287 +++$+++ 6099 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- petition?
03-287 +++$+++ 6100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so. I don't think that Johnson has a Federal habeas remedy here because the Federal habeas statute is a challenge to the legality of custody, the legality of confinement, and that's not anything that he's challenging in this case.
03-287 +++$+++ 6101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What would you do if there was an allegation of a serious procedural flaw in a past hearing? The parole commission was -- was drunk or they read the wrong file or something, and it was just a challenge to the invalidity of the past hearing. Would that be 1983 or habeas?
03-287 +++$+++ 6102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that's a closer call, but I think it --
03-287 +++$+++ 6103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's why asked you. Why isn't it -- (Laughter.)
03-287 +++$+++ 6104 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. And -- and I -- I think it is still section 1983 if certain things are present. That is, is he going to necessarily imply the invalidity of the duration of his sentence by winning his case? And if that's meets the Heck rule and if he isn't, then I think he can proceed in section 1983.
03-287 +++$+++ 6105 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we have any case in which what was being -- what was sought to be challenged in a habeas action was not the duration of the sentence, but the procedure by which the duration of the sentence was determined?
03-287 +++$+++ 6106 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't --
03-287 +++$+++ 6107 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there any -- why -- why shouldn't that be a habeas action? Why shouldn't 1983 be limited to prison conditions, which is what we've always -- and referred to it as -- as that in the past?
03-287 +++$+++ 6108 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think in the hypothetical that you've presented, Justice Scalia, if the prisoner wins the case in that particular case, then his sentence is invalidated, and I think that's the important critical factor here.
03-287 +++$+++ 6109 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no, not necessarily. He -- he's just saying the parole hearing I got lacked due process safeguards. Had I had those safeguards, I might -- I might -- have been given a shorter sentence. I can't prove I would have. I'm not challenging the sentence really, but I want a new hearing. I didn't get due process. Give me a proper hearing because I might get out earlier. Why shouldn't that come under habeas?
03-287 +++$+++ 6110 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because it's not a challenge to the legality of the confinement.
03-287 +++$+++ 6111 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My law clerk found two cases which we've just looked at briefly. One is called Wilwerding v. Swenson and the other Johnson v. Avery where she says that in those two cases people were using habeas to challenge prison conditions even. Now, so there are -- there are two cases that, if she's right -- and she's usually right -- that -- that -- where habeas was used to challenge prison conditions. So I've thought, well, if they can use it, they certainly could use it here.
03-287 +++$+++ 6112 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, and I -- I think point with -- with both of those decisions is that the Heck rule did not come into play because the prisoners must have gone through and exhausted their State court remedies, and so there wasn't an issue as to whether they must bring their claim in habeas.
03-287 +++$+++ 6113 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. It was a different issue, but it said habeas could be brought.
03-287 +++$+++ 6114 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. I think the Court in -- in that particular case --
03-287 +++$+++ 6115 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So habeas could be brought here?
03-287 +++$+++ 6116 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so.
03-287 +++$+++ 6117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why not?
03-287 +++$+++ 6118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think there's a remedy in habeas for the respondent Johnson in this case because the first thing that's going to be asked when he goes to the Federal district court to seek habeas relief is, well, are you challenging the legality of your custody?
03-287 +++$+++ 6119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, and they say sure -- sure I am. I'm saying I had terms. You know, I was going to be here under conditions A, B, C, and A, B, C in my opinion mean I will be released sooner, and instead, they gave me D, E, F, and D, E, F means I'm likely to be released later. I can't guarantee it. That's what he'll say. He says I can't guarantee it, but I wouldn't be bringing this case if I didn't think at least it was a shot.
03-287 +++$+++ 6120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. And -- and -- but he's not necessarily challenging the legality of his custody.
03-287 +++$+++ 6121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but -- but that's part of the conclusion that we're going to have to reach to -- to resolve the case. Why isn't he? How is that that much different than if a judge -- let's assume, under a proper sentencing guideline scheme, the judge just uses the wrong guideline. The man is going to go to jail for either 5 or 10 years. We don't know which. But that's -- that's a classic habeas case. Here, he's going to stay in a prison for 5 or 10 years. We don't know which. Why isn't this a classic habeas case?
03-287 +++$+++ 6122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because I think in -- in the first hypothetical, Your Honor, that -- that you gave, the challenge, if successful, would -- would completely invalidate the sentence that he received. They'd have to redo the -- the sentence. And -- and I think that's the critical distinction in this case, is that when Johnson files his complaint, he has a 10- to 30-year sentence by the -- by the State court. If he wins, he still has a 10- to 30-year sentence.
03-287 +++$+++ 6123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it wouldn't completely invalidate the sentence. We know that he's still going to be held and he's going to be held in custody. It's a question of how long, which is exactly what this case is.
03-287 +++$+++ 6124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But in the hypothetical you propose, Justice Kennedy, the -- the prisoner was actually -- would be actually challenging the sentence he received, and by winning the case, he's going to undo the State court sentence.
03-287 +++$+++ 6125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, well, those cases happen to involve -- happen to involve sentences. This case doesn't involve a sentence. It involves an opportunity to have his sentence shortened. And if habeas can be brought for that, we would phrase it differently. We wouldn't say it would have to invalidate the sentence. We would say it would have to invalidate the proceeding that could have shortened his sentence. I grant you we can't use the same language we did in the earlier cases, but if this is properly a habeas action, then we -- we can get some language to make it fit.
03-287 +++$+++ 6126 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't -- I don't think it is properly a habeas action. I think even in the decisions where courts may have heard similar claims in habeas, I think it was a matter of just saying, well, the prisoner is already here. He's already exhausted all of his State court remedies. It doesn't really matter whether it's section 1983 or habeas.
03-287 +++$+++ 6127 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose we wrote an opinion that said, whatever the reasoning -- I don't know what it would be right now -- that said in the future your client should go ahead in 1983. I'm putting you in a slightly awkward position, so don't answer if you don't want to. But I mean, for the future all these cases will be brought in habeas. Now, suppose that's what the opinion said. We're absolutely making it clear just what the -- would there be any harm done?
03-287 +++$+++ 6128 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I think there would be.
03-287 +++$+++ 6129 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, what would that harm be?
03-287 +++$+++ 6130 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that by -- by having a rule of that sort, that it would be expanding the jurisdiction of habeas and it would start to swallow up otherwise cognizable section 1983 claims.
03-287 +++$+++ 6131 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And why would that be bad?
03-287 +++$+++ 6132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And why --
03-287 +++$+++ 6133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry?
03-287 +++$+++ 6134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why would that be bad?
03-287 +++$+++ 6135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, because the Congress has enacted a statute --
03-287 +++$+++ 6136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. But I mean, is -- I'm asking you a practical question as a practicing lawyer. Would it be bad?
03-287 +++$+++ 6137 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely it would.
03-287 +++$+++ 6138 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because?
03-287 +++$+++ 6139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because there's a statute that allows --
03-287 +++$+++ 6140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I mean, leaving aside -- Congress changed the statute. It says absolutely it's going to be habeas. Is there any bad consequence in the law?
03-287 +++$+++ 6141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's going to give States a license to violate civil rights that will otherwise not be protected under the statute.
03-287 +++$+++ 6142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We'll catch them in habeas.
03-287 +++$+++ 6143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but the -- the State exhaustion requirements in habeas are much tougher. Of course, the State wants them to have to go through State exhaustion.
03-287 +++$+++ 6144 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ah, so it comes down to that.
03-287 +++$+++ 6145 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's really the critical --
03-287 +++$+++ 6146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You said -- you said a moment ago that it would be expanding habeas, and I'd like you to expand on that. It would be expanding habeas, I am assuming, because in every successful habeas case, the ultimate remedy that the court can order, if the State does not snap to it, is the immediate release of the prisoner. And I take it when you said it would expand habeas, it would expand it because this would not be an immediate release case no matter what. Is that correct?
03-287 +++$+++ 6147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
03-287 +++$+++ 6148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
03-287 +++$+++ 6149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You would basically end up going to a Federal district court seeking habeas relief asking for processes to be changed prospectively.
03-287 +++$+++ 6150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's why they could not bring habeas in this case because if they won, they still would not have shown anything that entitled to them to get out now or get out now unless the State within 30 days does something. Is -- is that the nub of it?
03-287 +++$+++ 6151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's -- that's really it, Justice Souter.
03-287 +++$+++ 6152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm -- I'm not sure. It depends how you formulate the order. The -- the judge says, I'm going to order this prisoner released unless, within 6 months, he has a parole hearing under the guidelines I set. That's the way the habeas statute works.
03-287 +++$+++ 6153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if that's the relief that the -- the prisoner was seeking, I think that is clearly a habeas claim. But that's not what Johnson is claiming in this case. He's not asking for entitlement to release at all. He's asking for the processes to be changed prospectively for future parole hearings, and he's asking for declaratory relief.
03-287 +++$+++ 6154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Regardless of what he's asking for, if he got what he wanted, he still would not be entitled to any immediate release.
03-287 +++$+++ 6155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's absolutely correct.
03-287 +++$+++ 6156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He would still have a sentence of X years, and the question is, how often are we going to look at him to decide when, within X years, we may let him out. Is that --
03-287 +++$+++ 6157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's -- that's absolutely it. He cannot -- by winning his case, he's not going to shorten his sentence in any way. And that's -- that's a big distinction from the Balisok case where there was an automatic entitlement to a shorter sentence --
03-287 +++$+++ 6158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, he might --
03-287 +++$+++ 6159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- for Balisok in that case.
03-287 +++$+++ 6160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- he might shorten the term of his confinement.
03-287 +++$+++ 6161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Might but not necessarily. And this Court made very clear most recently in the Nelson decision --
03-287 +++$+++ 6162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you could say the same thing when you're challenging the sentence. He might but he might not. We're just -- we're just hearing the case.
03-287 +++$+++ 6163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think a challenge to the sentence necessarily invalidates that sentence if you win. But a challenge to parole is much different because you're not affecting the sentence if you win your case. And the term necessary is completely necessary to the Heck analysis, as this Court made clear most recently in the Nelson case from last term.
03-287 +++$+++ 6164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's the nub of it I guess. The fact that he may be granted parole has no implication for the validity of the sentence.
03-287 +++$+++ 6165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's absolutely right.
03-287 +++$+++ 6166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In fact, it assumes the sentence is valid, but that he will probably stay clean if he gets out. That's all it means, isn't it?
03-287 +++$+++ 6167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's really all it means. And this Court last term in Muhammad in -- in footnote 1 made clear that the incarceration that matters for this analysis is the -- in the incarceration of the sentence from the State court. And I think that's -- that's what the Court needs to look at, is what is Johnson's effect on the State court judgment or sentence. What's the necessary implications? Not in this case at all. And really, this case I think has already been decided by Wolff. It's something that the petitioners sort of don't mention too much in their briefs. In Wolff, the prisoners in -- in that case were trying to get their good-time credits back. I think this is an easier case than the Wolff decision. And what the Court did was parse out, okay, you can't get your good-time credits back, but you can seek prospective injunctive relief to fix the processes that are used in connection with depriving prisoners of good-time credits. And that's precisely what Johnson is seeking here. Your Honor, the other thing I wanted to mention was the notion -- Your Honors, the other thing I want to mention was the notion that there's no State review of these decisions. The Prison Litigation Reform Act clearly provides for State administrative review of even challenges to the process. So the -- the State of Ohio could easily set up an appeal process administratively to -- to correct that problem.
03-287 +++$+++ 6168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Lewis.
03-287 +++$+++ 6169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LEWIS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you.
03-287 +++$+++ 6179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cole, you have about 4 and a half minutes left.
03-287 +++$+++ 6182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what's your position as to whether or not it's moot?
03-287 +++$+++ 6183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, we don't believe it's moot either, and in -- in fact, for two reasons. First, once again, it's threatening consequences for an existing decision, albeit it not the one that was originally threatened or where invalidity would be implied below, but there is a new one where that would have that consequence. In terms of bad consequences, I think the single biggest bad consequence of directing these prisoners to 1983 rather than habeas is it's going to deprive them of the opportunity for meaningful relief in Ohio's courts. The Layne decision in the last -- decided just 2 years ago, three prisoners brought a declaratory judgment action about the way parole works in Ohio. They were successful and their case resulted in 3,000 prisoners receiving --
03-287 +++$+++ 6184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but you raise deprivation of the benefit they would get from the Ohio courts. If they wanted that benefit, they could have brought a 1983 action in State courts. State courts have jurisdiction. So it's a little odd for you to say, oh, they're being deprived of a benefit when they're telling you by this very lawsuit they don't want it.
03-287 +++$+++ 6185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true, Your Honor. At the same time, this -- bringing this -- this case in 1983 in Federal court means that they're not going to be able to get injunctive relief on State grounds under the Pennhurst doctrine. So they are depriving themselves of a chance to get that type of meaningful relief that Ohio courts are offering and that courts in other States are offering. The other -- the other point I wanted to make is that with respect to Petitioner Johnson's argument, his understanding of sentence, that if it doesn't impact the sentence, it can't be in habeas, would mean that parole revocations can't be in habeas either. A parole -- parole -- when you're on parole, you're still serving part of your sentence, as he understands it, part of the initial term that the court has imposed upon you. Granted, you're not doing it in prison, but a parole revocation wouldn't impact your sentence. It would merely bring you back into prison to serve the remainder of your sentence rather than having you serve it on the street. So I think that understanding of sentence can't make sense for -- for habeas purposes.
03-287 +++$+++ 6186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think sentence means custody. Don't you think it means custody?
03-287 +++$+++ 6187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but to the extent we're talking --
03-287 +++$+++ 6188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The custody you've been sentenced to?
03-287 +++$+++ 6189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But to the extent we're talking about duration of custody or duration of confinement, again, the claims here do have a -- success on the claims here would have a meaningful impact on the duration of confinement. This Court in Muhammad said -- I think this is probably the -- the closest quote on point -- challenges to particulars affecting the duration of confinement are the province of habeas corpus. This is a challenge to a particular, the parole procedures, that's affecting the duration of their confinement. Or at least that's their allegations, and that's what success on their claims is going to mean. And because of those durational consequences, as well as because of the consequences of success on the merits for previous State parole decisions, we believe that those claims are better routed to habeas than to 1983. If there are no further questions.
03-287 +++$+++ 6190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I had one further question. Are you asking us to change anything in Wolff against McDonnell, or can we follow that case?
03-287 +++$+++ 6191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. COLE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think we can follow that case as it's been reinterpreted in Heck. Wolff said that -- well, Heck said that Wolff was about challenges that would not -- and I believe the language is -- necessarily vitiate the underlying decision. So the way Heck understood Wolff was that the procedural challenges there, with regard to the prospective relief they were seeking, were not the type of relief that would necessarily vitiate any decision that had already been made. Here, by contrast, the claims that they're bringing, the ex post facto claims, if they're successful on the merits, would necessarily vitiate the decisions that have gone before. Thank you, Your Honors.
03-287 +++$+++ 6192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Cole. The case is submitted.
03-388 +++$+++ 6196 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument in Bates against Dow AgroSciences. Mr. Frederick.
03-388 +++$+++ 6198 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: Pesticides are economic poisons designed to kill living things. Sometimes they do not work as designed. For more than a century until the 1990's, courts routinely permitted farmers to bring claims against pesticide manufacturers for crop damage caused by pesticides. In enacting amendments to FIFRA in 1972, Congress did not intend to displace those preexisting State law remedies. The farmers here allege claims for defective design, defective manufacturing, fraud, breach of warranty, and failure to warn for a brand new product that severely damaged their peanut crops. I'd like to start with our narrowest theories for reversal and demonstrate for three reasons why those claims survive preemption. The defective design and manufacturing claims challenge the product's composition, not its label. The fraud, warranty, and negligence claims involve general legal duties, not pesticide-specific requirements, and the failure to warn and fraud claims are not different from or in addition to FIFRA requirements. Now, with respect to the first point, Dow concedes at pages 43 and 49 of its brief that defective design and manufacturing claims generally are not preempted. That concession warrants a remand here, as this case was decided before discovery, enable the farmers to develop their claims.
03-388 +++$+++ 6199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But couldn't you make every failure to warn claim a defective design claim? That is, they didn't warn about the effects, but those effects would not have been present if the product had been designed to assure that there wouldn't be any adverse effect on the peanut crop.
03-388 +++$+++ 6200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the way the Restatement of Torts and Product Liability in sections 1 and 2 describe, there are basically three theories that products liability claims can proceed on: a defective design, defective manufacturing, and defective warnings. The restatement explains that they are distinct legal theories that go to different problems that the manufacturer has caused with respect to the product. A defective design claim asserts that the composition was inadequate and that a properly designed product could have been put on the market that would not cause the harm.
03-388 +++$+++ 6201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Frederick, on the defective design claim, presumably that's based on a factual theory that Dow could have reasonably designed Strongarm to be safe for growing peanuts in high-acid soil.
03-388 +++$+++ 6202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct.
03-388 +++$+++ 6203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But doesn't that mean your client should have to put forward some evidence establishing a material issue of disputed fact on that point?
03-388 +++$+++ 6204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Certainly, but here --
03-388 +++$+++ 6205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it didn't do that.
03-388 +++$+++ 6206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well here, Your Honor, the motion for summary judgment that Dow filed was not based on the merits of the claims. It was based on them being preempted, displaced as a matter of Federal law. They also asserted a limitation of -- of remedy provision. But we never had discovery in this case. The District Court, after finding jurisdiction, considered Dow's motion for summary judgment on preemption and locked us out of the courthouse door before we ever had a chance to prove that a safer design for the product could have been made. And that's where we think the court's decision below was overbroad and should be reversed.
03-388 +++$+++ 6207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the problem I have with -- with the Government's case and with the respondent's case is that -- it's really the obverse of what Justice Ginsburg said. Their problem is that they would recast everything as a warning.
03-388 +++$+++ 6208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's absolutely correct.
03-388 +++$+++ 6209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does the restatement have some specific provisions that say no matter how good the warning is, you're still entitled to proceed when there's a -- I don't know -- dangerous product or defective product or something?
03-388 +++$+++ 6210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Restatement sections 1 and 2 address this, and what the restatement says is that if you can show that the product could have been reformulated to be properly designed, then the existence of a warning that might go to certain of its uses would not negate a defective design claim. The Texas Supreme Court --
03-388 +++$+++ 6211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Even -- even if the warning specifically covered that design defect?
03-388 +++$+++ 6212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that's -- that's correct. And what the restatement --
03-388 +++$+++ 6213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So even if this product said, warning: may not be effective in high pH soils, that's not good enough?
03-388 +++$+++ 6214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under the restatement rule, which Texas has adopted in the Uniroyal case, which we've cited in our brief I think at page 47, that is true because the restatement explains that there are certain warnings that could be ignored or not observed or not understood properly and that if it can be proved that a properly designed product would be on the market, there are public policy reasons why that's what we want to encourage manufacturers to do. I mean, under --
03-388 +++$+++ 6215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At any cost? I mean, what if it -- you know, yes, I can -- I can sell you stuff that will -- that will work in high pH soil, but it's going to be three times as effective. Do I have to sell it?
03-388 +++$+++ 6216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the --
03-388 +++$+++ 6217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can't I just sell it for those people who don't need it for -- for high pH soil at a third the price with a warning that says, hey, by the way, don't use this in high pH soil? It's crazy to say you can't do that.
03-388 +++$+++ 6218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, to answer your question in several ways, that's a jury determination to -- to ascertain the reasonableness of the alternate design that the manufacturer would be asked to -- to do or to market a separate product that was separately designed for high-acid soils.
03-388 +++$+++ 6219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's never a question of the reasonableness or the adequacy of the warning?
03-388 +++$+++ 6220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think it's a question of warning in this sense, Justice Kennedy. If you take their theory, which is that a defective design claim always collapses to a failure to warn, they can put out a defectively designed product that admittedly causes harm, and all they have to do is change the label and say, if used in these particular circumstances, it may cause harm, because that would necessitate a change to the label --
03-388 +++$+++ 6221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, not necessarily. It wouldn't be always either way. I would think that if in fact you have a product and the product causes harm in a subset of cases, which you could warn against, then a jury could decide whether the unreasonableness consists of not having designed the super-safe product or the unreasonableness consists of not having had a different label.
03-388 +++$+++ 6222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that -- there are -- that's why the restatement makes clear that there are distinctive theories for defect --
03-388 +++$+++ 6223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you're arguing that in this case you have the first.
03-388 +++$+++ 6224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
03-388 +++$+++ 6225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It seems implausible on -- you know, --
03-388 +++$+++ 6226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we have both actually.
03-388 +++$+++ 6227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- because all they'd have to do is don't use it in pH soil.
03-388 +++$+++ 6228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. We have defective warning too, and -- and if I can address that as well. The statute here prohibits in section 136q(1) any false or misleading statement in the label as to any particular. Our position is that the 2000 label said, suitable for peanut-growing areas in all places where peanuts are grown. That was false. Under the statute, that is a misbranding, and that is actionable as -- both as a failure to warn, as a fraud claim, and as a breach of warranty. Now, the Medtronic majority made absolutely clear that that kind of claim is not preempted, and in fact all nine Justices agreed that when the State law claim is parallel to the Federal requirements, the existence of a State law remedy is not an additional requirement.
03-388 +++$+++ 6229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So on -- on that aspect of the case, you put in your pleadings that this was a violation of FIFRA.
03-388 +++$+++ 6230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't necessarily need to say a violation of FIFRA is -- so long as the requirement is the same, although we can certainly --
03-388 +++$+++ 6231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's a -- that's a bit different. You were -- you were asserting a moment ago I thought -- please correct me if I'm wrong -- that this was a violation of FIFRA because it was misbranded.
03-388 +++$+++ 6232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I --
03-388 +++$+++ 6233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It seems to me that you then have a suit under FIFRA, but I don't think that was the theory of your complaint.
03-388 +++$+++ 6234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. The theory of our complaint was a failure to warn both for negligence and as a defective product.
03-388 +++$+++ 6235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the reason for that, I take it, is that FIFRA does not -- I mean, I think you agree FIFRA does not provide an independent private right of action.
03-388 +++$+++ 6236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
03-388 +++$+++ 6237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you've got to sue under State law, but you would -- you would kind of have a slam dunk for your position, I suppose, if your pleading said, the failure to warn only to the extent that in fact the -- the warning given in compliance with FIFRA was an inadequate warning. That would -- that would keep you within the -- the -- in effect, the -- the Federal limit, and it would also make clear that you had a State law cause of action, not a Federal cause of action.
03-388 +++$+++ 6238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, and because --
03-388 +++$+++ 6239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and that's in effect what you're arguing.
03-388 +++$+++ 6240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. And -- and because of the preliminary of this suit, Justice Kennedy, we certainly should have the opportunity to amend our complaint. There are counterclaims that this is done at the motion for declaratory judgment.
03-388 +++$+++ 6241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In your view -- in your -- your opinion, if you were to follow that, would EPA -- suppose EPA does the following. EPA looks into this and they publish a reg that says in this case or in this subset of cases, or some kind of description that fits yours, we think that the labeling should be thus and so and we think that State tort suits will interfere with our ability to promote the uniform labeling and therefore they're preempted. Can the EPA do that on your theory?
03-388 +++$+++ 6242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, it can and the -- the interesting aspect of this, Justice Breyer, is that of course EPA hasn't done that. EPA has made very clear it never tested for efficacy. It never even gave notice and comment so that --
03-388 +++$+++ 6243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, EPA has -- has waived efficacy data requirements. Right?
03-388 +++$+++ 6244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-388 +++$+++ 6245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, is it your position that a State can pass a law requiring labels to have efficacy claims?
03-388 +++$+++ 6246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They have to do it pursuant to their powers under 136v(a) which is the regulation of sale or use or under 136v(c) which says that when a State designates a particular locality requirement and a special need, it can impose a label -- it can impose requirements that the manufacturer has to comply with. Now, the EPA importantly -- and this is in their regulations at 163.152 -- has specifically said that States have labeling authority. The States can impose labeling requirements. Now, there's no reason why --
03-388 +++$+++ 6247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you're not relying on that in this cause of action.
03-388 +++$+++ 6248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice -- no, Justice O'Connor, except to the extent that if the State can affirmatively do it through a positive regulation, their theory has to be wrong that the -- that any incidental effect that induces a change to label is preempted. That theory has to be wrong, and that's what the Fifth Circuit relied on.
03-388 +++$+++ 6249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, does -- does FIFRA require the manufacturer to say on the label what the item can be used for?
03-388 +++$+++ 6250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but I want to address --
03-388 +++$+++ 6251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So how -- how does an express warranty claim escape preemption --
03-388 +++$+++ 6252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As the --
03-388 +++$+++ 6253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- where -- where Dow just says the federally mandated statement is included on my label and it's true?
03-388 +++$+++ 6254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A warranty claim, Justice O'Connor, as this Court made clear in the Cipollone case, is not a requirement under State law because it's a voluntary contractual arrangement between the parties. The Court I think has made clear that what has to be ascertained here is does the State cause of action or the State law create a requirement. That's not true in the warranty case because FIFRA doesn't speak to requirements in -- as to warranties. It speaks to requirements in other ways. So what Dow did here with its warranty was completely voluntary, and the fact that it breached that warranty by putting on the market a product that was not suitable for the use in all areas where peanuts are grown is a breach of a warranty that it voluntarily undertook. Breach of that is not a requirement imposed under State law. And that has been, I think, verified by seven Justices of this Court in the -- in the Cipollone case. Now, if I could speak to the fraud claim, it is important to understand that in both Cipollone and in a footnote in Medtronic, the Court made clear that where there are general legal duties that are not observed by the manufacturer that don't go to the specific product itself, those claims are not preempted. Here our assertion is that Dow put on the market a -- a product that was mislabeled and that they went out and told people fraudulently was suitable for their uses. We acted in reliance on that and we suffered damages. Those are general legal duties, not pesticide-specific ones. And the existence of the preemption clause of 136v(b) does not displace us from the opportunity to try to prove to a court that fraud was committed here. Now, if I could briefly address two points. One is that the inducement to change theory should be rejected. That was the basis on which the Fifth Circuit decided this case and it is an overly broad theory for several reasons. First, it's not supported by the text of 136v(b) which says requirements for labeling. It doesn't say requirements that induce a change to the label. And that's how many of the courts have gone off track since the Cipollone decision was announced by this Court. They have read FIFRA as saying just because the word requirements is 136v(b), thereby any State law claim that imposes a requirement that might induce a manufacturer to change the label is thereby preempted. We think that's overly broad because it confers way too much discretion on manufacturers to decide what to put on labels, and they can claim immunity for any overly broad claim of efficacy so long as when they are sued, they can say we're induced to change the label. Because EPA does not evaluate the specific contents with respect to efficacy or the claims that are made on -- on a label, if a manufacturer makes an overly ambitious statement as to efficacy, all the manufacturer has to do under the inducement to change theory is go to court and say we would have to change the label and thereby 136v(b) preempts it. Now, I'd also like to stress that the other side's theory creates a huge regulatory gap. As your question, Justice O'Connor, noted, the EPA does not evaluate efficacy on the front end. And in fact, the history behind these provisions is that EPA understood from the very beginning that common law claims would serve an important incidental regulatory effect. If we could review the history for a moment. Prior to the 1972 changes to FIFRA, for decades farmers had brought claims against manufacturers for design defect, for failure to warn, for the kinds of common law claims that we have asserted in this case. It was so well established by 1972 that there was a huge section in the American Law Reports that annotated all the cases and explained what the common law duties of pesticide manufacturers were. Yet, notwithstanding that, when Congress enacted the 1972 act, despite thousands of pages of hearings, committee reports, legislative debates, there is not one mention of any effort to displace those preexisting common law claims. And when EPA, in discharging its responsibilities under the 1972 act, got overwhelmed by the requirement that it re-register products that were already out on the market, pursuant to the 1972 act's standards, it very promptly went to Congress and said, you should waive efficacy requirements because we simply can't do this. Congress responded, but importantly in the administrations on both sides, EPA has always understood except until just a couple of years ago when the Solicitor General changed the position of the Government, that these kinds of incidental common law suits would have an important regulatory effect. If we could just take the case of DDT. For 30 years, manufacturers were sued for DDT and awarded damages until it became clear that the groundswell over the course of decades that DDT needed to be banned, and it was only at the back end that the expert agency regulators determined that in fact the product needed to be banned, but that was only after a very long history in which common law suits had provided remedies to farmers and others who were harmed by that product. Now, in 1982, the Reagan administration's EPA expanded the efficacy waiver and it included far greater products than had been done in the Carter administration in 1979. And in the Federal Register notice announcing that it was intending to expand that efficacy waiver, the EPA in 1982 said the reason why we think this can be done is because suits can be brought against manufacturers who put on the market ineffective products. We cited that on page 31 of our brief.
03-388 +++$+++ 6255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But do you take the position that juries can do what a State regulation cannot do, or are they much -- are they on a par?
03-388 +++$+++ 6256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, our broadest theory, Justice Kennedy, is that the word requirements in 136v(b) doesn't include common law claims at all.
03-388 +++$+++ 6257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose we disagree with that.
03-388 +++$+++ 6258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you disagree with that, then they would have to be the same, and that's why our point about the existence of the parallel requirements is the same. I want to address the point of the discordance between what State juries can decide and what State regulators can decide because Dow and the Government have featured that in their case. The Government in the Medtronic case at page 27 of its amicus brief there said there was no problem to be had with juries rendering supposedly inconsistent decisions so long as they were following one Federal standard. The Federal standard here is clear: falsity. Tell the truth. That's what manufacturers are obliged to do under the statute and under the regulations.
03-388 +++$+++ 6259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's their strong point. So what is the response to that? Because you can easily get two juries in different parts of the country to decide absolutely opposite things as to what the label should say, and in those circumstances, they say, well, they're in an impossible situation and that's why Congress passed this statute, to be sure it would be EPA and not two juries in different places.
03-388 +++$+++ 6260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ First, the juries -- unlike a -- a declaratory judgment or an injunctive type remedy, Justice Breyer, a jury for a common law damages claim is not saying what affirmatively should be on the labels.
03-388 +++$+++ 6261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm speaking practically. And I don't have to go into all the argument.
03-388 +++$+++ 6262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure.
03-388 +++$+++ 6263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You know the argument. It's a very familiar argument.
03-388 +++$+++ 6264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. The answer is that -- that Congress was prepared to accept a certain level of disuniformity when it enacted 136v because it made very clear in sandwiching the preemption provision of 136b -- surround -- by (a) and (c) that it was prepared to allow States to depart in significant respects from what was nationally uniform. And the way it did so was to say States can regulate sale or use and they can also impose extra requirements for special locations. Now, what Dow did here I think illustrates the way the system is supposed to work, which is that when a problem was identified with their product in the States of Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, within 7 months it petitioned the EPA to append to its national uniform label a supplemental label. And that supplemental label says it is for distribution in those three States only and it provided 10 important changes to the label that it otherwise had as a nationally uniform label. That's how the system is supposed to work. If the incidental regulatory effect of jury verdicts or common law claims induces or causes some kind of change to the label, that can be done without an adverse effect to national uniformity through the supplemental labeling process. And what Dow did here was it has its label and then it attaches the supplemental label that addresses the particular conditions that exist in the State. And the EPA has recognized that as a perfectly appropriate and valid way to address the geographic, environmental, and climatic conditions that exist in the different regions of the country that engage in agriculture. There's nothing that is uncertain about that if you accept the premise of the Government's argument in Medtronic, which is that juries can be properly instructed, if it came to that, so that they could follow the appropriate Federal standard. Now, I would like to turn -- sorry. Did you -- no, go ahead. I would like to turn briefly to the -- the requirements aspect of the case because we do think that, under our broadest theory, this is a different situation than Medtronic and Cipollone, and because of the important statutory indications that are in the provision 136v. Unlike in Medtronic, there is an explicit provision that is a non-preempted provision, and that is different from Medtronic. Where in Medtronic there was a provision that allowed the FDA to impose its own decisions as to requirements and whether or not the States should be displaced, here Congress made the determination in 136v(a) and in (c) that those kinds of requirements can be imposed. They're in addition to what the Federal standard is. That means that you have to look at requirements in a somewhat different way because the States have this authority that they did not have under the Medical Device Amendments. There's a textual indicator under (b) also which refers to (a) in the sense that (b) says such State that shall issue these requirements. Such -- the meaning of it in Webster's means what has been already described -- is in (a), and in (a) the States are authorized to promulgate regulations. So we think that there is a textual basis for distinguishing the word requirements that this Court -- five Justices in this Court in Medtronic said would encompass common law claims. If there are no further questions at this time, I'd like to reserve the balance --
03-388 +++$+++ 6265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me ask one because I think you'll hear some variation of this, and you have a minute, which is the -- the statute sets up a perfectly good way of keeping this branded stuff off the market. All any complaining farmer has to do is to go to EPA and ask them to pull it, and pulling it is an unbelievable sanction. It's like the atomic bomb on the company. And so that's very strong. And the only thing that leaves out is the possibility of damage remedies, but if you want your damage remedy, just go to EPA and tell them to give it to you because they can write the rule the other way that I was suggesting.
03-388 +++$+++ 6266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't think that EPA could write a rule requiring damages to be done. It doesn't have the statutory authority --
03-388 +++$+++ 6267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They would just say it doesn't preempt.
03-388 +++$+++ 6268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there's no indication here that EPA can do that kind of thing. In FIFRA, it certainly doesn't have that kind of provision. I mean, certainly there are different ways that the statute could have been written. That isn't the choice that Congress made. Thank you.
03-388 +++$+++ 6269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Waxman.
03-388 +++$+++ 6271 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: FIFRA's preemption provision, which Congress specifically amended in 1978 to add the title uniformity, preempts by its terms, quote, requirements for labeling different from those required under FIFRA.
03-388 +++$+++ 6272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why -- why doesn't the other amendment limit your argument? Because Congress has also passed an amendment to the effect that unless EPA chooses to get in to the business of -- of passing on efficacy, it -- it need not do so. And in fact we know it is not doing so. Why, therefore, doesn't the uniformity argument go to those subjects that EPA does review for and why doesn't the subject of efficacy, in effect, drop out of -- of the -- the whole preemption claim?
03-388 +++$+++ 6273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There are -- there are two fundamental reasons. The first is that it is a principal requirement of FIFRA, and has been since 1972 and remains, that a manufacturer may only sell a registered pesticide with the precise labeling to the word and font size that EPA has approved, and that requirement applies whether the wording relates to human safety, environmental protection, or efficacy. Now, the specific amendment in 1978 was, as Mr. Frederick indicated, represented a representation by EPA to Congress -- and Congress' -- the -- the committee report plainly indicates this -- that the EPA was not saying we are no longer regulating efficacy, we are no longer concerned with efficacy. What they said was because the Department of Agriculture and the extension services and the State universities are all involved in this and, in particular, are involved in the statutory requirement that before a manufacturer can even apply for registration, even submit a registration application, the manufacturer must do extensive, rigorous efficacy testing, which Congress has indicated correctly is very expensive --
03-388 +++$+++ 6274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it's not monitored at all. The -- the manufacturer can say -- make up reports and EPA is never going to look at it.
03-388 +++$+++ 6275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the manufacturer makes up reports, it has committed a felony. EPA can enforce it. It can refer it to the Attorney General. It's just like the --
03-388 +++$+++ 6276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But maybe it isn't a labeling violation. I mean, there are claims made here that I have trouble shoehorning into your theory. For instance, why does a claim that Dow negligently failed to field test its product on peanuts on acid soil impose a label requirement?
03-388 +++$+++ 6277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice --
03-388 +++$+++ 6278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I just don't understand that.
03-388 +++$+++ 6279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice O'Connor, I think -- I will address the negligent testing and, of course, the design defect --
03-388 +++$+++ 6280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-388 +++$+++ 6281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- discussion that's figured so prominently in my colleague's argument. It's very, very important to understand that unlike in Sprietsma and Medtronic and so many of the -- and, for that matter, with respect to the preempted claims in Cipollone, the claims that were preempted below, we didn't file a rule 12 motion to dismiss. We couldn't have with respect to at least one of those two claims. We filed a motion for summary judgment that said with respect to -- let me take design defect first. With respect to design defect, it is possible under Texas State law to state a claim for products liability under defective design without impeaching the labeling. And there is a brief filed in this case by Dean Powers, the University of Texas Law School, for the -- the Texas Chemistry Council who's an expert on Texas tort law, and he goes through the Texas torts in detail to show why they are all preempted and all invalid under independent and adequate State grounds. But what we did is we didn't move to dismiss. We filed a motion for summary judgment, and in that motion for summary judgment, we pointed the respondents in this case to this Court's decision in Celotex v. Catrett, and we said, in effect, we know that you can allege a design defect claim without impeaching the labeling, but we think that what you are complaining about does impeach the labeling. Therefore, show us what you have. Now, under rule 56, they had two alternatives. They could have filed an affidavit or a request under rule 56(f), as this Court referenced in Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, and said, hey, we don't know how this was made. We don't know how this was tested. We don't know how this was manufactured. We're entitled to discovery, and district courts recognize that all the time. What they did --
03-388 +++$+++ 6282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And they didn't do that?
03-388 +++$+++ 6283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They did not do that, and what they did was to submit affidavits and documentary evidence, including expert affidavits.
03-388 +++$+++ 6284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, you said they didn't file a motion to dismiss. I thought you brought the lawsuit.
03-388 +++$+++ 6285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We brought the lawsuit and we --
03-388 +++$+++ 6286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But then they couldn't file --
03-388 +++$+++ 6287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no. I said we didn't file a motion to dismiss --
03-388 +++$+++ 6288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You didn't file a motion to dismiss your own complaint?
03-388 +++$+++ 6289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. Their counterclaims.
03-388 +++$+++ 6290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, okay.
03-388 +++$+++ 6291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, this wasn't decided -- Mr. Frederick's reply brief talks over and over and over again about how this was decided on the pleadings, and you know, there was no discovery allowed. Under rule 56, they could have asked for discovery when we basically said, okay, let's show our hands. We got two jacks. What do you got? And what their expert said and what their response said was if the 2001 amended label had been on it, we wouldn't have been injured. Now, rule 56(c) says that when you oppose a summary judgment motion with affidavit evidence, the burden is on the adverse -- the adverse party must by affidavits, or otherwise provided in this rule, set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial, and they didn't do that. Now, the classic design defect -- let me -- let me give you an example.
03-388 +++$+++ 6292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let's just try to boil it down a little bit for my purposes. Do you concede that there could be a claim based on no testing --
03-388 +++$+++ 6293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
03-388 +++$+++ 6294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that there could be a claim based on design defect, that there could be a claim saying there were off-label oral statements made that amounted to fraud or misleading --
03-388 +++$+++ 6295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'll take them in your precise order.
03-388 +++$+++ 6296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
03-388 +++$+++ 6297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Under Texas law -- and the Court of Appeals opinion, the Grinnell opinion cited by the Court of Appeals opinion, says this, as does Dean Powers. Under Texas law, negligent testing is not an independent tort. It is of necessity a subset of inadequate warnings. It is an element of a -- the tort -- the claim of product defect related to warnings. And so it is not possible under Texas law, settled Texas law. Other States are different, but Texas in its sovereign capacity has chosen to make claims of negligent testing an element of the tort of defective product by failure to warn, and that --
03-388 +++$+++ 6298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the way you proceeded in this case, you made it clear that it would be impossible for the Texas court itself to weigh in on this because you jumped the gun. They wanted to proceed in Texas court, and then we would have known what Texas law was on these subjects. You said, no, we want to be in the Federal forum.
03-388 +++$+++ 6299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We want -- as the -- as the Fifth Circuit found and the District Court found, we filed a declaratory judgment in Texas after we received their demand letters because we wanted this to be adjudicated in a single forum, which the Texas venue rules would not have allowed, and we -- we actually filed this in Lubbock, Texas, which is the geographic center of where these 29 farmers operate. Now, with respect to defective design, yes, under Texas law if they had a -- they have to allege and they have to prove that there is a safer alternative design for this product, which they never even introduced one quantum of evidence about. But --
03-388 +++$+++ 6300 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me you're -- you're arguing the merits of the tort claims rather than the preemption issue.
03-388 +++$+++ 6301 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what we said was your claims are preempted if they impeach the labeling that we are required by Federal law to use.
03-388 +++$+++ 6302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But they now say they don't. They ought to be able to proceed on those claims. What do we do with that?
03-388 +++$+++ 6303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what this -- what -- what happens under rule 56 --
03-388 +++$+++ 6304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And also the -- also the claims of false, misleading statements outside the label.
03-388 +++$+++ 6305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I'm going to get to the false and misleading statements outside the labeling in a minute, but just to finish the design defect point, they filed a complaint -- a counterclaim which had as a count this was defectively designed. It is possible under Texas law to prove that something is defectively designed. If they had come in and said, but we filed a motion for summary judgment that says here's our evidence and we don't think that you can satisfy -- that you are, in fact, complaining about a defective design --
03-388 +++$+++ 6306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if they did allege a defective design claim under Texas law, would that have been preempted?
03-388 +++$+++ 6307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. If -- if they had said, look, the problem with this, which as footnote 9 of our brief indicates, it's not a --
03-388 +++$+++ 6308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me your argument is not whether there's preemption. It's whether there's a State cause of -- State law cause of action.
03-388 +++$+++ 6309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no. It's -- it's both. With respect to defective design, what we said is, your claim is preempted because you aren't going to go to the jury on defective design without impeaching the label. If we're wrong, prove it in response to our summary judgment submission.
03-388 +++$+++ 6310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you can --
03-388 +++$+++ 6311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that their burden?
03-388 +++$+++ 6312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is --
03-388 +++$+++ 6313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that their burden or is your burden to show --
03-388 +++$+++ 6314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is -- it is absolutely their burden in -- as the responding party to a motion for summary judgment, to show that there are material facts that are either in dispute or there are material facts that would allow them to go to the jury.
03-388 +++$+++ 6315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But on your theory there is no material fact, it seems to me, because your -- what you say they cannot make good on that claim without impeaching the label.
03-388 +++$+++ 6316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And they --
03-388 +++$+++ 6317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Every time they sue on the -- on the ground that -- let's say, that -- that the -- the actual use was inconsistent with what the label described, you could say, gee, if their theory is correct, we'd have to change our label to say that what's on the label now is in fact not properly descriptive of the product. So it's not a -- a question of needing more fact. On your theory, whenever they, in effect, sue on the basis of what you say, your response is going to be, as a matter of law, well, if they're correct, we'd have to say something else. That impeaches the label. Therefore, preemption.
03-388 +++$+++ 6318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is exactly right. What they could have done in response to our motion for summary judgment is to say this product assertedly harms -- when it is applied before the seed is planted, will harm the product it is -- the plant that it's supposed to protect if the soil pH is too high. They could have easily have come back and said if they had a -- a design defect claim that didn't impeach the label to say you should have -- there was a way to manufacture this product. You could have it in pellet form rather than in the soluble form or if the problem was the alkalinity of the soil, there is a way to design this so that it is dissolved in a more acidic solution. The classic case, which is referenced in the NRDC brief, which has many, many examples of true design defect claims that don't impeach labels, is a case involving rat poison. It's a case called Banks v. ICI America. It's a Georgia Supreme Court --
03-388 +++$+++ 6319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you quite clearly have both. I understand that. Let me ask you a question about the -- the preemption point because what I think they're saying is go read the red brief, your brief, pages 6 and 7, and there you see a statutory requirement and you see regulatory requirements, regulation. And I think one of their claims is we are arguing that that statutory requirement, without any change in the regulatory, that -- that it was violated. These are false. They're misbranded. So we are not imposing a requirement different from or in addition to the requirement of Federal law. We are enforcing a requirement that is the same as the requirement of Federal law, and if, by the way, the EPA were to think that tort suits in those circumstances in practice are too disuniform, let them promulgate a regulation to that effect. But they haven't. Now, what -- what is the answer to that argument?
03-388 +++$+++ 6320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The answer is threefold. Number one, a challenge to a -- the wording of a statement on the label on the grounds that it is false and misleading is -- does impose a requirement different than Federal law, not the requirement that -- that labeling not be false and misleading, but the fundamental requirement that a -- unless and until the EPA says otherwise, the manufacturer can only sell this product with the precise labeling that EPA has approved. And it -- if you look at page 63a --
03-388 +++$+++ 6321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman, do I --
03-388 +++$+++ 6322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- of the joint appendix --
03-388 +++$+++ 6323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman, do I take it from what you have just said that there is no -- even though the statute prohibits misbranding, that there is no way that that can be privately enforced, that misbranding is something strictly for EPA to deal with, that the statute has a prohibition on misbranding? I can see the argument that all we're doing is enforcing the provision that says no misbranding. So is EPA the only the player in the misbranding --
03-388 +++$+++ 6324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Insofar as labeling is concerned, the answer is yes, and that's because the statute -- the statute has many, many instances in which it makes it clear that in service of the objective of a nationally uniform label, the expert agency that approves and dictates the language of that label be the one to decide what is or isn't --
03-388 +++$+++ 6325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman --
03-388 +++$+++ 6326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where does it say that?
03-388 +++$+++ 6327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- can I ask you one question here?
03-388 +++$+++ 6328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because you were just going to point out where it says that --
03-388 +++$+++ 6329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It goes to your --
03-388 +++$+++ 6330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- which I think is --
03-388 +++$+++ 6331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Excuse me.
03-388 +++$+++ 6332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry.
03-388 +++$+++ 6333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Just let me ask this one question. Supposing the label says, this product contains vitamin A. Period. And it doesn't contain vitamin A, and they prove that in court. And you say you would have to change the label. I suggest you could change the product by putting vitamin A in it.
03-388 +++$+++ 6334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you can -- you're --
03-388 +++$+++ 6335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why isn't that an answer to the misbranding? You change the product not necessarily the label.
03-388 +++$+++ 6336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because the difference between a -- that would be a -- a manufacturing defect, which are cases that have been decided --
03-388 +++$+++ 6337 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It would be a false statement in the label. The label happened to be false, a misrepresentation in it.
03-388 +++$+++ 6338 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if the -- if it contains -- I'm sorry. Was it vitamin A? If it contains vitamin A because that's what the manufacturer intended and that's what the manufacturer produced --
03-388 +++$+++ 6339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. The manufacturer knew it didn't contain it. He falsely put that in the statement --
03-388 +++$+++ 6340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, I see. Said that --
03-388 +++$+++ 6341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and -- and it's -- it's a misbranded, false statement. Now, does he have to change the label or could he change the product?
03-388 +++$+++ 6342 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I believe that you have -- you would have to -- I mean, would it be efficacious with vitamin A? I don't know, but if it -- if it requires a change in the label, it has to be done by EPA because the manufacturer commits a Federal law violation if it sells the product with any different label. If you -- if I can just direct the Court's attention to --
03-388 +++$+++ 6343 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but I'm suggesting he could sell the product with the same label if he just changed the product to correct the misstatement.
03-388 +++$+++ 6344 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the test, as the Fifth Circuit stated, Justice Stevens, is whether a judgment against Dow -- I'm quoting. Quote: whether a judgment against Dow would cause it to need to alter the Strongarm label. I'm -- and that's the -- those are -- that's the test that was applied here and is always applied.
03-388 +++$+++ 6345 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay, but why --
03-388 +++$+++ 6346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is, does the State law cause of action -- is it premised on a State law duty that there -- that different labeling be used --
03-388 +++$+++ 6347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but neither --
03-388 +++$+++ 6348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that is, a little bit different than what Federal law requires.
03-388 +++$+++ 6349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The problem that I think some of -- several of us are having is that both the -- as I understand it, the Fifth Circuit test in your argument draws no distinction between the two following kinds of situations. Situation A: there's something that the manufacturer should have told you, should have put on the label, but the manufacturer didn't. Situation B: the manufacturer puts something on the label which in fact is wrong and in Justice Stevens' example is in fact false and it causes harm. It makes sense, it seems to me, for preemption purposes to say if the person who sues sues simply on the ground that I bought it in reliance on the label, the label was false, I should get damages for -- for whatever harm was caused, that situation should be dealt with for preemption purposes differently from the situation in which the -- the manufacturer made no false statement. He simply should have said more. And if -- if you don't distinguish between those two situations, then the -- the prohibition against mislabeling means absolutely nothing because -- because it can never be enforced, in effect, except with respect to some prospective user. It can never be enforced with respect to the actual user.
03-388 +++$+++ 6350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, that is a choice that Congress could have made. It is plainly not a choice that Congress did make because it applied the preemption provision to requirements that are either in addition to or different than. And whether a label is assertedly misleading because it fails to include something on the EPA-approved label or --
03-388 +++$+++ 6351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Requirements for labeling or packaging --
03-388 +++$+++ 6352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
03-388 +++$+++ 6353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that are in addition to or different.
03-388 +++$+++ 6354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I -- I --
03-388 +++$+++ 6355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Requirements for labeling or packaging.
03-388 +++$+++ 6356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, and -- and if it -- if the --
03-388 +++$+++ 6357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, and the argument that's being made is that we ought to -- we ought to read -- we ought to read the limitation, which Justice Scalia has just described, with respect to labeling and packaging, in a relatively narrow way to allow the suit to go forward and, therefore, we ought to make a distinction between the two kinds of situations.
03-388 +++$+++ 6358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The allegation in this suit -- the claims in this suit -- and I -- I see that my time has expired.
03-388 +++$+++ 6359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ms. Blatt.
03-388 +++$+++ 6361 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: It would entirely destroy the uniformity contemplated by -- contemplated by the statute if the EPA-approved and mandated label were subject to jury-by-jury invalidation based on a jury's determination of whether a label is false.
03-388 +++$+++ 6362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is a new position for the Government, isn't it?
03-388 +++$+++ 6363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, we have --
03-388 +++$+++ 6364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You used to take the opposite position.
03-388 +++$+++ 6365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right.
03-388 +++$+++ 6366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And we're dealing here, as -- nobody has mentioned it, but there -- there's a clear statement rule for preemption, isn't there? Doesn't the preemption of -- of traditional State powers have to be clear in the statute?
03-388 +++$+++ 6367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We -- we think subsection (b) is unambiguous in preempting any statement.
03-388 +++$+++ 6368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's -- it's ambiguous enough that the Government -- the -- the chief beneficiary of the -- of the supposed preemption didn't see it. It used to come out the other way. How can you possibly say it's clear?
03-388 +++$+++ 6369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the agency is allowed to change its position and we realize --
03-388 +++$+++ 6370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understand. It's -- it's welcome to change it, but it -- it's one thing to change it. It's another thing to change it and come in to say that the question is clear.
03-388 +++$+++ 6371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we think that -- we realize that our position was inconsistent with not only the Court's decision in Cipollone and in Medtronic that recognizes that requirement extends to common law duties. But more importantly, a system where a jury-by-jury on the same facts could come up with completely different reasons why a label is false --
03-388 +++$+++ 6372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So -- so if you have one administration thinking the one thing and the other thinking the other thing, why isn't the answer that the agency can promulgate the reg it wants? And therefore if the reg -- if the agency comes to that conclusion, let them promulgate that reg. And if a different one thinks it can work with the tort suits, let them promulgate that reg.
03-388 +++$+++ 6373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, unlike Medtronic where preemption occurred by virtue of the FDA's regulation, under FIFRA there's preemption by virtue of the statute itself. And I just want to give one --
03-388 +++$+++ 6374 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but why isn't there a big difference, for purposes of your argument, between the Medtronic situation and this one for the simple reason in this case you've got a statute that authorizes EPA to do absolutely nothing on the subject of efficacy? And EPA does nothing on the subject of efficacy.
03-388 +++$+++ 6375 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's just not true, with all due respect. I mean, they -- the -- we don't verify the accuracy of the efficacy labeling, but the requirement, both in the preemption provision and in the requirement to use the EPA label, clearly extends to efficacy. And you can have disuniform context whether it's safety or efficacy. Imagine a label that directs a product to be mixed for 20 minutes. One jury could find the label was false because the product should have only been mixed for 10 minutes. Another jury in the same courthouse could find the label was false because the product should have been mixed for at least 30 minutes. And this case is another really good example. Now the petitioners are saying the label says that the soil only should be a 7.2 level. Their expert says --
03-388 +++$+++ 6376 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but the remedy to that would not necessarily be to change the label. It might be to change the quality of the product that requires how much time for mixing.
03-388 +++$+++ 6377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And we think it's critical that our position is that this statute only operates in the area of labeling, and it preempts only those State labeling requirements --
03-388 +++$+++ 6378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What do you say about my vitamin A example?
03-388 +++$+++ 6379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think your vitamin A example is an excellent example of a non-preempted claim. If a manufacturer says that this is a pesticide and he puts Clorox in the bottle, the plaintiff wants to get to the jury on the theory that a reasonable manufacturer would not have used Clorox. He would have used the pesticide. If the argument, on the other hand, is Clorox was fine. I don't have a problem with Clorox, I just wish I would have been given a warning, but that's not the way a plaintiff would frame his complaint. We think it's critical that our theory is if the plaintiff's theory of recovery is necessarily -- necessarily predicated on a requirement that the manufacturer used a label different than the EPA-approved label the Federal law required it use --
03-388 +++$+++ 6380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let's -- let's be specific here. If it's a failure to test, if it's a -- a design defect requirement, if it's an off-labeled, false misrepresentation, why are they preempted?
03-388 +++$+++ 6381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ On the face of the complaint, we agree that they're not preempted. Our only position is by the time it got to summary judgment, the courts decided that they had no evidence on what would have been non-preempted claims. If another farmer wants to bring an expert that says Strongarm can be manufactured --
03-388 +++$+++ 6382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But then do you endorse the theory of the Court of Appeals in this case?
03-388 +++$+++ 6383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we think the Court of Appeals took it claim by claim and read the affidavit -- or at least the District Court did --
03-388 +++$+++ 6384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you think just mere inducement to change a label is sufficient to create preemption.
03-388 +++$+++ 6385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mere inducement only to the extent that that's a shorthand way of saying the label was -- necessarily had to be required. Let me give you an example.
03-388 +++$+++ 6386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If Congress wanted that, surely it could have stated it more clearly than simply saying the State shall not impose or continue in effect any requirements for labeling or packaging. A tort suit because of -- of mislabeling is not a requirement for labeling or packaging.
03-388 +++$+++ 6387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the --
03-388 +++$+++ 6388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if Congress wanted to say that, they could have said it.
03-388 +++$+++ 6389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think they did say if a common law duty is necessarily premised on the requirement that the manufacturer used a different label than Federal law required him to use. In this case, the common law duty of a failure to warn is saying the manufacturer should have put something on --
03-388 +++$+++ 6390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You have -- you have that provision which talks about requirements for labeling or packaging in conjunction with another provision that authorizes the State to regulate the sale or use.
03-388 +++$+++ 6391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The --
03-388 +++$+++ 6392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, you -- you have to make sense of the two.
03-388 +++$+++ 6393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, and that's --
03-388 +++$+++ 6394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it seems to me that means the State can impose certain requirements upon the seller to the consumer --
03-388 +++$+++ 6395 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not on labeling. Justice Scalia, every day --
03-388 +++$+++ 6396 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, every change -- virtually every change -- virtually everyone -- if -- if you believe the respondent's theory, virtually any State regulation of the substance of the sale will require a change in the label.
03-388 +++$+++ 6397 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's just not true. Every day States and localities around the country are imposing use restrictions. They tell -- they tell applicators and users when and where to apply the pesticide and what types of --
03-388 +++$+++ 6398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sale -- sale or use is what it says.
03-388 +++$+++ 6399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right and they --
03-388 +++$+++ 6400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Say -- if they regulate the sale or use.
03-388 +++$+++ 6401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right, and they do that every day without imposing labeling requirements. Imagine -- imagine --
03-388 +++$+++ 6402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Give me sale examples.
03-388 +++$+++ 6403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They require the manufacturer, in order to sell the product, be registered with the State, and they can impose whatever sale restrictions they want --
03-388 +++$+++ 6404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And can they --
03-388 +++$+++ 6405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that don't go to the labeling.
03-388 +++$+++ 6406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can they do the same thing by -- through jury verdicts?
03-388 +++$+++ 6407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely not. It would be bad enough if a manufacturer had to shop his label around 50 States and had each --
03-388 +++$+++ 6408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So now -- so now you say a State can do something by regulation that a jury can't do.
03-388 +++$+++ 6409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. A State absolutely cannot impose labeling restrictions on a manufacturer.
03-388 +++$+++ 6410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm asking if the -- if juries can do anything that the -- are -- are prohibited under your view from doing anything that the State could do by a State regulation.
03-388 +++$+++ 6411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. I'm sorry. Right. Under -- it -- the alternative theory would give more power to the jury to impose labeling restrictions than the State, and we don't think the State can do it. And it would be far more pernicious if a label were subject to jury-by-jury invalidation. No one would read the label, much less understand it.
03-388 +++$+++ 6412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ms. Blatt, there's a brief in this case -- there's a brief in this case that just shows hundreds, if not thousands, of crop damage claims. And your theory is that with this ambiguous provision Congress wiped all that out. It's hard to believe.
03-388 +++$+++ 6413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. Congress just wiped out labeling and only those labeling requirements --
03-388 +++$+++ 6414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But everything becomes -- but every -- every time -- my crop was stunted. Okay. You have to change the label so you can't bring that suit.
03-388 +++$+++ 6415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, it's just not true. The lower courts well understand this distinction, and they -- they let go all the time claims as not preempted that are true manufacturing defect or true design defect claims. This is not a complete immunity. This is a narrowly targeted one as to labeling. There is a famous example of the Benlate --
03-388 +++$+++ 6416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He says their claim is -- is very simple. You didn't tell us that using this in our kind of soil would stunt the crop and wouldn't kill the weeds.
03-388 +++$+++ 6417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
03-388 +++$+++ 6418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you're saying that kind of claim can't be brought anymore.
03-388 +++$+++ 6419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It can be brought if there's State law and evidence to support the State law that doesn't attack the labeling. And our --
03-388 +++$+++ 6420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I've described a set of facts which your position I think you have to say affects the label. The -- the farmer says I bought this bottle. It said okay for all peanuts. My crop grew and it was stunted and the weeds stayed alive.
03-388 +++$+++ 6421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If they found an expert that said if you had manufactured this differently or if you had designed it differently and there was evidence to support that, our view is that those claims aren't preempted. And the alternative to let juries --
03-388 +++$+++ 6422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I'm not giving you that case. I'm giving you exactly what happened.
03-388 +++$+++ 6423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This case -- they didn't have any evidence other than saying that the label was inaccurate. But the next -- another jury could rely on the respondent's evidence to say the label was inaccurate because it works better on high pH soil, and another jury could say, well, we need a margin of safety and the label should have said 6.8 instead of 7.0, which is what their expert says. And you can have this time and time again with how often the pesticide has to be applied, when it has to be applied. And to -- and the -- the whole point of section 136v(b) was to have reliability --
03-388 +++$+++ 6424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was that happening when EPA took the opposite view? Was there this tremendous disparity with juries going every which way --
03-388 +++$+++ 6425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. BLATT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there's -- there's been preemption at least since the late '80's, and I don't know of cases where juries -- or the theory for recovery was invalidating the label. There are lots of cases that are true manufacturing defect claims, and I direct your attention to the Benlate where the manufacturer contaminated his product. If I'm the plaintiff, my theory -- the theory was you mismanufactured this product. A reasonable manufacturer would have taken practices to prevent contamination, and it destroyed a lot of crops and EPA actually took enforcement action against that manufacturer. The rat poisoning example -- a 9-year-old kid died of rat poisoning because it tasted like a candy bar. The theory of recovery was all the manufacturer had to do was put a bittering agent in it that would have made the kid throw up and the rats still would have loved the poisoning. That has nothing to do with the label.
03-388 +++$+++ 6426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Ms. Blatt. You have about 4 minutes.
03-388 +++$+++ 6428 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FREDERICK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I just have two points to make. With respect to the summary judgment posture of the case, the way this unfolded was that on one day the District Court decided the motion for jurisdiction, that it had jurisdiction. On the very next day, Dow rushed into court with its motion for summary judgment. And what Mr. Waxman cites as the Celotex invocation merely says that on -- on this point it is neither unfair nor premature to require defendants to produce evidence in support of their claims now as the Celotex trilogy requires. I'm reading from their motion for summary judgment. That was filed before the counterclaims. The only thing that they knew about was the deceptive trade practices notice letter that the farmers had filed pursuant to State law. So they didn't know what our claims were, and they were requiring or saying that the District Court could throw us out of court without giving us any opportunity to file counterclaims, much less try to develop evidence that would prove them. Now, with respect to the disuniformity point, when Congress amended the statute in 1988 to add the word uniformity, it said in that public law that it was a technical amendment. We don't know why Congress put the word uniformity in. The legislative history is barren. It just says this is a technical amendment. It didn't change the substantive provisions that empowered States to impose regulations that would have the effect of disuniformity. Now, at the end of the day, we've got claims that have been brought historically since the late 19th century. Until EPA had a sudden change of heart, there were decades in which juries made these decisions with respect to these kinds of products, and those preemption decisions really didn't take hold until after this Court announced Cipollone in 1992. And it was only at that point that the courts began to have preemption, but for the previous 2 decades, juries routinely decided these kinds of cases. The sky did not fall. EPA didn't come in and say there's labeling disuniformity as a result of this. There simply were no problems. But what did happen was that the farmers who used products were able to get compensation when pesticides damaged their crops. Thank you.
03-388 +++$+++ 6429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The case is submitted.
03-407 +++$+++ 6433 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in No. 03-407, John F. Kowalski v. John C. Tesmer. Mr. Casey.
03-407 +++$+++ 6435 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In this facial challenge to the Michigan statute, court of appeals rulings that these lawyers have third party standing and that their potential clients have a constitutional right to appointed counsel in discretionary appeals are both wrong. First, with respect to the standing argument, in our brief we argue that the respondent attorneys could not meet any of the criteria for standing. This morning I'd like to focus on the element of prudential standing that considers whether there is a hindrance to the ability of a third party to protect his own -- to protect his own interest.
03-407 +++$+++ 6436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- there is an injury in fact. These lawyers claim that if the State were compensating for this service and they're on the list to be appointed, they would have more money in their pockets. You're not -- you're not challenging that there is an injury in fact.
03-407 +++$+++ 6437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. In our -- in our brief we have challenged that. The -- the requirement is that there be an injury in fact, a concrete and particularized actual or imminent injury in fact.
03-407 +++$+++ 6438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you -- you said now you were going on to the prudential factors, and so I asked were you recognizing that there was an injury in fact, and you said no. And -- and why not? Because it seems so obvious that they would get appointments if the system were --
03-407 +++$+++ 6439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I take it you're reserving it for -- in your -- in your brief.
03-407 +++$+++ 6440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I am not waiving the argument. I -- I would like to rest on the brief. But I -- in answer to your question, we believe yes, there is a likelihood that these lawyers on the list for appointed counsel will some day -- if they stay on the list and a case comes up in that county, there is a likelihood that there will be a case. We submit, however, that on these facts in this facial challenge, we don't know how many lawyers are on the list for appointments in Saginaw County. We don't know how many appeals of this nature come up. So it may be many years before the situation arises. This is not a concrete and particularized actual or imminent injury in fact, and we've argued that in the brief. At -- at best, if there is an injury in fact and if there is -- another factor is the close relationship to the third party. We believe those are weak at best, and we've argued in our brief that they don't exist. I think it is most clear, however, that the criteria concerning the hindrance to the third party does not exist here. This is a facial challenge bought by -- brought by lawyers before the statute took effect, claiming not that the statute violates their own constitutional rights, but that it violates the rights of potential future clients, and that the lawyers will suffer economic harm.
03-407 +++$+++ 6441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I clarify something about this case? Are any of the indigent defendants whose rights the respondent attorneys want to advance -- do any of those people themselves have standing to bring their claims in Federal court now?
03-407 +++$+++ 6442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. We argue that there are -- there are three ways that an indigent defendant can bring this claim themselves without having to rely on an attorney in this type of case. First, they can bring the challenge directly through the State courts.
03-407 +++$+++ 6443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm asking if there are any individuals now before this Court in this case --
03-407 +++$+++ 6444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. None of these -- none of these defendants --
03-407 +++$+++ 6445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- who would be available and who would have remedies or standing to bring their claims. Are we just talking pure hypotheticals here?
03-407 +++$+++ 6446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In this facial challenge, we're talking about pure hypotheticals. The -- the three named indigent defendants --
03-407 +++$+++ 6447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There were three named indigents.
03-407 +++$+++ 6448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct.
03-407 +++$+++ 6449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They were?
03-407 +++$+++ 6450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They were denied counsel.
03-407 +++$+++ 6451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Denied counsel, and they were also dismissed at some point down the line?
03-407 +++$+++ 6452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. The -- the Sixth Circuit held that the Federal court should abstain from deciding their claims because they could have brought their claims in their direct State appeals. They raised claims about the practice of denying counsel before the statute took effect.
03-407 +++$+++ 6453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Casey, was it a Younger abstention --
03-407 +++$+++ 6454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-407 +++$+++ 6455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- with respect to the --
03-407 +++$+++ 6456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the Sixth Circuit en banc held that under Younger v. Harris, the Federal court should abstain from deciding the claims of the three indigent defendants.
03-407 +++$+++ 6457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that means that the defendants could never bring this 1983 suit. Only the lawyers arguably could.
03-407 +++$+++ 6458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. Younger v. Harris is only -- only defers the time when a proper Federal civil rights action can be brought. There were -- at the time this action was brought, there were pending State appeals in two of the cases. One of the defendants never appealed at all. The Sixth Circuit recently issued an opinion not --
03-407 +++$+++ 6459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why didn't these lawyers instead of -- instead of trying to sue on their own, why didn't they just offer their services to -- to these defendants through the State courts?
03-407 +++$+++ 6460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, perhaps opposing counsel could answer that better than I. We say that is the --
03-407 +++$+++ 6461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, that's what I don't understand about -- about the fact that they won't -- won't have the right to counsel. It -- it's at least as easy for -- for counsel to appear in cases in which indigents need counsel as it is for counsel to bring their own lawsuit.
03-407 +++$+++ 6462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is our point on the standing issue precisely, Your Honor.
03-407 +++$+++ 6463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Didn't -- didn't the Michigan Supreme Court already rule on this issue and said that the statute was constitutional, that there was no right to counsel, therefore no possibility of appointing counsel, paid counsel?
03-407 +++$+++ 6464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. In -- in 2000, the -- the -- while this case was pending, the Michigan Supreme Court issued an opinion, the Bulger decision that's discussed in the briefs, saying that the practice of denying appointed counsel was constitutional. The statute was not in effect at that time. The statute took effect, and in a case just decided in June of this year, People v. Harris, the Michigan Supreme Court relied on Bulger and said this statute is constitutional. It does not violate any rights.
03-407 +++$+++ 6465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So going through the State system, there's no possibility that these lawyers or the defendants could successfully assert a right to paid counsel --
03-407 +++$+++ 6466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct.
03-407 +++$+++ 6467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- because that's already been decided by the Michigan Supreme Court.
03-407 +++$+++ 6468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As -- as a matter of jurisprudence by the State supreme court, yes. Both State and Federal constitutional --
03-407 +++$+++ 6469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There -- there's an appeal from -- they could request certiorari from the State supreme court to this Court, I assume.
03-407 +++$+++ 6470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There are, in fact, two cases pending, the Harris case that I just mentioned. A petition for certiorari was filed about 2 weeks ago raising this precise claim. There is another case Halbert v. Michigan. It's docket --
03-407 +++$+++ 6471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was there -- was there a cert petition in Bulger itself?
03-407 +++$+++ 6472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There was a petition in Bulger.
03-407 +++$+++ 6473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it was denied.
03-407 +++$+++ 6474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was denied. In -- in addition --
03-407 +++$+++ 6475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there -- there is a cert petition filed in what case? In the June case?
03-407 +++$+++ 6476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In the -- the case is pending in this Court as Melody Harris v. Michigan. It was filed about 2 weeks ago. I have not been able to find out the docket number. There was another case, Halbert v. Michigan, which is a pro se defendant who was denied counsel. His applications, pro se applications, were denied in the State appellate courts. A pro se petition was filed. I filed a response to that about a month ago. That's docket number 03-10198. It's on this Court's conference for Friday, October 8th.
03-407 +++$+++ 6477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So your point is that there are petitions filed here that would enable this Court to decide whether the Michigan Supreme Court was correct in holding the statute constitutional.
03-407 +++$+++ 6478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. There are at least those two petitions pending that I'm aware of in this Court now.
03-407 +++$+++ 6479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you acknowledge there is a good Federal question there at least?
03-407 +++$+++ 6480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes. It's -- it's an important question.
03-407 +++$+++ 6481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
03-407 +++$+++ 6482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- we -- in the Bulger case, I opposed certiorari, saying that yes, it's an important question, but it was correctly decided. At that time, there was no conflict. Then when the Sixth Circuit opinion came up, we filed the petition saying it's an important question and now there's a conflict between the State supreme court and the Federal court of appeals.
03-407 +++$+++ 6483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the position you've taken in -- in the Halbert case, that the Court should take the case?
03-407 +++$+++ 6484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What I said in the Halbert case is that the Court need not grant this petition now because, although it's an important question, the issue is pending in -- in this Tesmer, the current case, Kowalski v. Tesmer. If this Court rules in our favor on standing and then does not reach the constitutional question, then it would be appropriate to grant certiorari in either the Halbert case or the Harris case because the -- the determination of the constitutionality of this statute is important to the State of Michigan.
03-407 +++$+++ 6485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do they have lawyers in those cases?
03-407 +++$+++ 6486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, the Halbert petition is pro se. The Harris petition has either retained or pro bono counsel. But the -- the constitutionality of the statute is -- excuse me -- is directly challenged in both of those petitions.
03-407 +++$+++ 6487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask you if in exercising prudential judgment on whether to accord prudential standing, because I guess there's article III standing here, is it appropriate to take into consideration as one fact that it's already been argued in this case and it's now ripe for decision, or should we just totally ignore that aspect of the case?
03-407 +++$+++ 6488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As a matter of judicial economy, there is a point to be made that it -- the issue has been briefed and argued. So perhaps it should be decided. Just last term in Elk Grove v. Newdow, the Court faced a similar situation. They disposed of the case on standing --
03-407 +++$+++ 6489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but in that case there was a conflict between the interests of the third party and the interests of the litigant or a potential client. Here there's no conflict between the lawyers and the clients.
03-407 +++$+++ 6490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true. That's true.
03-407 +++$+++ 6491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, also bearing upon our prudential judgment, I -- I suppose, would be that in order to reach the merits, we have to do what you assert to be an end run around the Younger abstention. And --
03-407 +++$+++ 6492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's -- that's correct. In my view, the -- the most logical, most appropriate disposition would be to say that these attorneys do not have standing. Therefore, reverse the Sixth Circuit's judgment. There are these other vehicles pending now to reach the constitutional issue.
03-407 +++$+++ 6493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but why isn't the Younger abstention problem just like the mootness problem in Craig against Boren? It took one class of litigants unavailable but then allowed the third party to have standing. Why -- why aren't -- aren't your opponents here just like the bartenders in Craig against Boren?
03-407 +++$+++ 6494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in determining prudential standing, there are several criteria that should be examined in deciding whether there's an exception to the general rule where a litigant cannot argue the rights of third parties. In Craig v. Boren, the statute directly affected the vendor in that case. It was a statute against sale of certain alcoholic beverages. And in this case we don't have that. Also, in Craig v. Boren, nobody argued prudential standing considerations until the case reached the Supreme Court apparently. But in our case, we have a situation where we have lawyers who do not have any present clients who are not directly affected by the statute. They're not claiming rights --
03-407 +++$+++ 6495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but they have the same interest that the bartenders had because they won't make some -- sell their services and the bartenders wouldn't sell the booze. I don't see the difference.
03-407 +++$+++ 6496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in -- in Craig v. Boren, the -- if the bartenders did not comply with the statute, they'd be subject to criminal penalties. Here, the attorneys will not be subject to any criminal penalties.
03-407 +++$+++ 6506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the -- the claim that -- I'm sorry.
03-407 +++$+++ 6507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it just would seem to me that the lawyers who are advancing this claim may or may not be representing individuals who want to make the same claim, but there -- there must be some lawyers who want to make these claims who don't have any clients, and the question is whether they have standing. And are they to be defeated standing because there are a lot of other lawyers who might also sue?
03-407 +++$+++ 6508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In our view, as a general proposition, lawyers should not be given independent standing to raise claims of their clients. When the clients can present their own issues themselves, as they can in this case or in this situation under the statute, there's no need --
03-407 +++$+++ 6509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that different from Caplin & Drysdale where the lawyers didn't raise the interest of the client and --
03-407 +++$+++ 6510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Again, there was an actual client in that case and there was significant money at stake. The lawyers had been paid money from drug forfeiture. They had been paid $25,000, and they wanted another 107 --
03-407 +++$+++ 6511 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But as far as the actual client, you moved to dismiss. So that's why there's no -- was no back-development. You moved to dismiss. Therefore, you have to assume whatever facts --
03-407 +++$+++ 6512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that's correct.
03-407 +++$+++ 6513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in favor of the opponent of the motion.
03-407 +++$+++ 6514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. But my response on that was to the question of, you know, do they in fact now have clients. There is no allegation in the complaint and no proof that they now have clients. They may --
03-407 +++$+++ 6515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if -- if you assume -- you assume the correctness of the allegations, which you -- you have to do at this point, the allegation is that they would get clients and would be paid but for this bar to payment. Isn't that correct? So if you take them in terms of their claim, you've got to assume that they will have clients and they can bring this -- this issue on behalf of the client.
03-407 +++$+++ 6516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct. That goes to the criteria of injury in fact and close relationship with the third party. We still have the criteria that I wanted to discuss this morning about hindrance to the right -- to the ability of the third party to litigate for themselves. Excuse me. In our view, there is no need to expand the doctrine of standing to permit lawyers to have independent standing to make these claims because the clients, who are directly affected by the statute, can make them themselves. There are the two pending habeas -- or two pending petitions for certiorari that we've mentioned. There is another case, the Bulger case. Mr. Bulger himself, after he lost in the Michigan courts, he filed a petition for -- for habeas corpus. And the district court granted the writ of habeas corpus. We appealed. That case is now pending in the Sixth Circuit. So that's another vehicle. It is also possible that an indigent inmate himself could bring a section 1983 case. It's simply not necessary to expand the doctrine of standing to give lawyers --
03-407 +++$+++ 6517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How could an indigent bring a 1983 case? I thought you said that that would be barred by Younger.
03-407 +++$+++ 6518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If they had a pending prosecution, it would be barred by Younger. Once that pending prosecution is over, they could bring a 1983 action.
03-407 +++$+++ 6519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could they? Because I thought this Court had held that -- that you can't bring a 1983 suit if what you're seeking to do is overturn the conviction.
03-407 +++$+++ 6520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under Heck v. Humphrey, if the outcome of the 1983 case would necessarily imply that the conviction or sentence is invalid, you cannot bring the 1983 case. Here, the allegation is simply that they were entitled to counsel. That's not the substantive merits of whether the claim -- whether they are properly convicted or properly sentenced. The Sixth Circuit, in a case decided August 31st --
03-407 +++$+++ 6521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if that -- that -- that's -- you're saying that the defendants themselves could not sue now under 1983?
03-407 +++$+++ 6522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A -- a defendant who is currently in the State system on direct appeal is barred by the abstention doctrine from filing a 1983 action. But after they go through the State court and lose, in addition to filing a writ of certiorari with this Court --
03-407 +++$+++ 6523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And presumably up to this Court, if they want to come that far.
03-407 +++$+++ 6524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, certainly. After -- after they go through the State court, they could file a writ of cert in this Court, as the two pending petitions have. They could file a complaint for habeas corpus. They could bring a facial challenge under 1983. In a case called Howard v. Whitbeck from the Sixth Circuit, just decided about a month ago, that was the very question that was decided. An inmate -- a prison inmate, challenging another statute, litigated and lost in the State court, then filed a 1983 action. We argued in a Federal case under Rooker v. Feldman, he was actually trying to seek review of the State court judgment. The district court agreed. But the Sixth Circuit just said Rooker v. Feldman bars the as-applied challenge, but they remanded for a trial on the merits of the facial challenge, which is not barred by Rooker v. Feldman. So an inmate who has been unsuccessful in the State court, under Sixth Circuit law in my jurisdiction, can bring a 1983 action. So there are at least three vehicles that an inmate can bring --
03-407 +++$+++ 6525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And do you -- do you agree that that's right? And you said that that's their theory, that they could bring a 1983 action.
03-407 +++$+++ 6526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We are not filing a petition for certiorari from that decision. We are abiding by that decision. We're going back and we're going to try that case on the merits of the facial challenge to the statute. That -- that case is Howard v. Whitbeck, docket number 03-1396.
03-407 +++$+++ 6527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, what the other side says is, well, yes, maybe they can bring these suits, but in all of those suits, they don't have counsel, what they -- what they --
03-407 +++$+++ 6528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true. That -- that gets into the -- the merits of the constitutional claim. And in our view, talking about the merits, all that is required in the Michigan application for leave to appeal process is that a defendant identify the issues and ask the appellate court to review it. Unlike Douglas, this is not a review on the merits. An order denying an application for leave is not an affirmance. It's not an adjudication of the merits of any legal issue.
03-407 +++$+++ 6529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what do we look to in order to verify what -- what you've just said? Do the Michigan appellate courts catch mistakes all the time? And if so, what's the standard that they use?
03-407 +++$+++ 6530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The court rules concerning applications for leave do not set out specific standards. What -- what the court of appeals can do on an application for leave is grant the application, deny it, or issue peremptory relief.
03-407 +++$+++ 6531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what are the standards they use? Where -- where do I look to find out what standards they use, if I get there?
03-407 +++$+++ 6532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To the best of my knowledge, there are no published standards in court rule or statute on that. The court is free to exercise its discretion to -- to deny leave for any reason that it chooses.
03-407 +++$+++ 6533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can you give me an example of where they grant leave to appeal, and if not -- and it's not one of the exceptions listed in the statute such as incorrect --
03-407 +++$+++ 6534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If -- if --
03-407 +++$+++ 6535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- such as incorrect sentencing?
03-407 +++$+++ 6536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if -- under the statute, if the court of appeals grants leave, counsel is automatically appointed.
03-407 +++$+++ 6537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. What are the instances in which they grant leave, other than sentencing or some other statutory --
03-407 +++$+++ 6538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They're -- most often they are sentencing issues. The statistics we put in our brief, in footnote 25 of our brief, indicated that out of the -- in 2001, there were 38,000 guilty plea convictions. The court of appeals that year disposed of 7,600 cases. 14 percent of them were guilty plea appeals. Most of them were disposed of by order. There were somewhere in the neighborhood of about 50 decisions -- opinions issued in guilty plea cases. I have not canvased all of them. I suspect that the vast majority of them are sentencing issues.
03-407 +++$+++ 6539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do we -- do we know whether any of those were cases that didn't fall under the four categories where you a -- a right to?
03-407 +++$+++ 6540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In every case where there was an opinion, counsel was appointed. The statute requires it.
03-407 +++$+++ 6541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But one of the problems, I thought, for the indigent is the rulings -- am I correct -- in Michigan, that they're not required -- say, there's an objection. There's no written record that the indigent could look to, even assuming he could understand it, to -- to determine what issues might be raised on -- on appeal.
03-407 +++$+++ 6542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe you're incorrect on that, Your Honor. The -- what an indigent inmate will -- or defendant will have available to him to prepare an application for leave to appeal is a transcript of the proceedings. He's entitled to that for free. He will have whatever written motions and written decisions the trial judge may have issued. He will have -- in the transcript, he will have the oral motions and the decisions of the judge, and then in addition to whatever pro se materials, as in the Ross v. Moffitt case, the inmate can muster. In -- in these cases, there are other pro se materials available. The district court's opinion in this case noted that there is a -- a form brief, 38-page brief that was circulating among inmates on the precise question of entitlement to counsel, which two of the defendants used in their State court appeals. But in determining whether counsel is constitutionally required under Ross v. Moffitt, this Court has said you look to two things. Are the merits decided? What is the nature of the appellate process? And if the merits are not being decided, as in the Michigan case, we say that falls within the Ross v. Moffitt line of cases, unlike the Douglas case. In -- in addition to the nature of the appellate proceedings, he --
03-407 +++$+++ 6543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, now, your -- your opponents quote some language from the -- one of the Michigan court of appeals which suggests that the reason that an appeal was denied was it had no merit.
03-407 +++$+++ 6544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A -- a typical order that the court of appeals issues when it denies an application for leave to appeal says, denied for lack of merit on the grounds presented. But there is published, controlling Michigan authority, which we cited in our brief, that says that language does not mean that the court of appeals looked at the merits of the underlying legal issue. What -- what the court is looking at is the question of whether to grant leave or deny leave. If they grant leave, counsel will be appointed. In a very real sense --
03-407 +++$+++ 6545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what are they getting at when they say merit? I mean, I take it you concede there was a quotation from that Contineri case on -- cited on page 30 of their brief. I mean, what -- what is the reference to merit supposed to mean?
03-407 +++$+++ 6546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I do not know why the court of appeals uses that language. What I do know is that the --
03-407 +++$+++ 6547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't the reasonable thing to assume that they use it as we would normally expect it to --
03-407 +++$+++ 6548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the --
03-407 +++$+++ 6549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- to mean by the words they use?
03-407 +++$+++ 6550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ On its face, that would be the first impression that is given from those words. However, the published opinions of the court of appeals we've cited in our brief reject that, and they say that in an application for leave to appeal, the court of appeals is not adjudicating the merits. My opposing counsel in this case was counsel of record in the Bulger case in the Michigan Supreme Court. He made exactly that same argument. He persuaded the dissent in that opinion, but he did not persuade the majority. They didn't decide the issue precisely, but he has been arguing that ever since. But the -- all the precedent that Michigan has on that point we've cited in our brief. Those are not decisions on the merits.
03-407 +++$+++ 6551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it true that Michigan is the only State in the Union so far that denies counsel on a first appeal, whether discretionary or mandatory?
03-407 +++$+++ 6552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe that is incorrect. The plaintiffs have cited a 1987 habeas corpus case that purports to make a national survey. In the Michigan v. Bulger Michigan Supreme Court opinion in footnote 3, they cited a 1992 Arizona study which reached almost an opposite conclusion. They said there were only seven States which give unrestricted right of appeal, and there were 21 States that prohibited appeals --
03-407 +++$+++ 6553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not -- not the right of appeal. The right to counsel, whether it's a mandatory or --
03-407 +++$+++ 6554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's my understanding that Michigan may be the only State that has a specific statute prohibiting it with exceptions like this, but it's also my understanding that the practice in many other States is that counsel is routinely denied in appeals from guilty pleas. I'd like to reserve my remaining time.
03-407 +++$+++ 6555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Very well, Mr. Casey. Mr. Moran, we'll hear from you.
03-407 +++$+++ 6557 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: In fact, in the 41 years since this Court's decision in Douglas, no State, not one, not even a -- a territorial jurisdiction, except for Michigan, has even attempted to deny counsel to any indigents appealing any type of first tier appeal.
03-407 +++$+++ 6558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Mr. Moran, this is a very important question, whether the Michigan law can survive. But I think before we can address that, we have to decide whether there is standing for the lawyers you represent here today, and that's a much tougher question I think. Is it possible that this Court could grant certiorari in one of the pending petitions and resolve the underlying issue of constitutionality of Michigan's unusual law?
03-407 +++$+++ 6559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is, of course, possible, Justice O'Connor, that this Court could do that.
03-407 +++$+++ 6560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if we were to grant you standing here, wouldn't we have sort of expanded our existing holdings on who has standing?
03-407 +++$+++ 6561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not at all, Justice O'Connor. This case fits squarely within the two prior lawyer-client standing cases, the Triplett case in which this Court unanimously found standing for a -- for a lawyer representing black lung claimants, and the Caplin &Drysdale case in which this Court found standing for a third party assertion by a firm representing a criminal defendant. And what those three cases have in common and what makes them unique is that this can only arise in a case in which the statute or law being challenged disentitles the client either through loss of funding or through, like Michigan's law, a statute -- disentitles the client to representation. Any other change in the law, tort reform brought up by my --
03-407 +++$+++ 6562 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it doesn't really disentitle the client to representation. It says counsel won't be appointed for him. But presumably these lawyers could have offered their services.
03-407 +++$+++ 6563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, that wouldn't be practical, and that raises a point that Justice Souter also raised in the argument. It wouldn't be practical for Mr. Fitzgerald or Mr. Vogler to offer their services pro bono to some indigent in this position because to do so would probably -- probably be unethical or malpractice. First of all, they can't be appointed. What the statute prohibits is the appointment of counsel like Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler. So they -- they cannot form an attorney-client relationship by operation of law.
03-407 +++$+++ 6564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But isn't the answer that all they have to do is to say, okay, I will represent him but I am representing him with a claim for funds? And at the end of the day, regardless of what the Michigan law says, I'm going to say to the State of Michigan, through the court, pay me for what I did. That isn't a waiver and there's nothing unethical about it.
03-407 +++$+++ 6565 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But Justice Souter, that's impractical and unethical in this case because if Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler were to do that, they would have to represent the indigent on his or her underlying plea and sentencing issues --
03-407 +++$+++ 6566 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
03-407 +++$+++ 6567 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- or those would be lost forever --
03-407 +++$+++ 6568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-407 +++$+++ 6569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- because the time would fly. And so if they also represented him on the underlying plea and sentencing issues, then this person would not -- then the underlying defendant would not be a person with standing to raise the lack of counsel because in fact they have counsel.
03-407 +++$+++ 6570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, which -- which indigent defendants are the attorney plaintiffs asserting claims on behalf of here? Is it past defendants?
03-407 +++$+++ 6571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This was -- this was -- for Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler, they were challenging both the prestatutory practice of the three defendant judges.
03-407 +++$+++ 6572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're talking about the two individuals, but they've been dismissed.
03-407 +++$+++ 6573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. Mr. Fitzgerald and Mr. Vogler, Justice O'Connor, are the attorneys. They were -- they --
03-407 +++$+++ 6574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm trying to find out what indigent criminal defendants are these attorneys attempting to represent here.
03-407 +++$+++ 6575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They routinely take appointments. They are on a list of --
03-407 +++$+++ 6576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Future defendants?
03-407 +++$+++ 6577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Presently and future defendants.
03-407 +++$+++ 6578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Past defendants?
03-407 +++$+++ 6579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Past defendants. They -- they --
03-407 +++$+++ 6580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if it's past defendants who were convicted and didn't have counsel, how is it consistent with Heck v. Humphrey that they could be here, these attorneys?
03-407 +++$+++ 6581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think I -- I think I misspoke. At the time the statute was passed, it had not gone into effect. This challenge was filed in order to prevent the statute from going into effect, to prevent approximately 2,000 Michigan indigents a year being denied the right to counsel.
03-407 +++$+++ 6582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, are you asserting then that these attorney respondents are here trying to represent future defendants?
03-407 +++$+++ 6583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Present and future defendants.
03-407 +++$+++ 6584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if it's present defendants, how is that consistent with Younger? How can they do that?
03-407 +++$+++ 6585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they're not representing any named defendants. The -- the problem is that as the statute goes into effect, they will presumably not receive any further funding for --
03-407 +++$+++ 6586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if it's future people, how is it consistent with Los Angeles v. Lyons? I mean, I just don't see how these attorney representatives get here.
03-407 +++$+++ 6587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they're in exactly the same position as the bartender in -- or the beer vendor in -- in Craig v. Boren. They're representing prospective clients, prospective patients as in Singleton v. Wulff again. This Court has over and over again -- in fact, in Triplett itself, this Court recognized that -- specifically said that in Triplett that it applied to prospective clients, that the -- and it said that in Triplett that -- it quoted the three factors. And it said that -- excuse me. I'm looking at the wrong page. It said in Triplett that a restriction upon the fees a lawyer may charge applied to the lawyer's prospective client of a due process right to obtain legal representation falls squarely within this principle. And that was the principle of third party standing that this Court cited --
03-407 +++$+++ 6588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, of course, in Triplett, the attorneys themselves were subject to discipline. They were raising third party rights in order to defend a proceeding brought against themselves. It seems to me that's distinguishable.
03-407 +++$+++ 6589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's --
03-407 +++$+++ 6590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the same thing in the bar case. The -- the restriction against the sale of -- of liquor was a restriction imposed upon the person seeking to raise the third party right. But here, there's no restriction that applies to these lawyers who are seeking to raise the third party right.
03-407 +++$+++ 6591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But Justice Scalia, this Court has never held that such a restriction is a condition precedent or required in order for a person to assert third party rights.
03-407 +++$+++ 6592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's so, but we've never held what you want us to hold either, that -- that when the law does not bear upon you personally, you have the right to raise the claim of a prospective client. We've never held that either.
03-407 +++$+++ 6593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, in -- Singleton is a case in which there was no direct sanction against the doctors who provided Medicaid abortions.
03-407 +++$+++ 6594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, just as -- as to Triplett and Boren, you can't cite those two cases and say those are controlling and then say, well, we've never held it.
03-407 +++$+++ 6595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. I didn't follow that question, Justice Kennedy.
03-407 +++$+++ 6596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we've said that Triplett and -- and Boren are -- are distinguishable, and you said, well, we've never ruled on this point. Well, then Triplett and Boren aren't controlling.
03-407 +++$+++ 6597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think you have ruled on this Court -- point by many times recognizing that even persons against whom the statute or law would not directly affect -- for example, all the way back to 1925 with Pierce v. Society of Sisters, there was no legal prohibition against the school. The legal prohibition was against the students not going to public school. So 80 years ago this Court recognized that. In a situation analogous to this, the school --
03-407 +++$+++ 6598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was -- a prohibition was on the parents and there were no parents as plaintiffs in that case --
03-407 +++$+++ 6599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right.
03-407 +++$+++ 6600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- only the schools.
03-407 +++$+++ 6601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Justice Ginsburg. It was the school that was -- was held to have standing to assert the rights of future and current students, and the same is true of the Singleton case where, again, there was no particular restriction against the doctors. It was simply that they would not get funding.
03-407 +++$+++ 6602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there was a problem, wasn't there, in Singleton that -- that the part that said that the doctors could raise the patients' right as opposed to the doctor's own right to practice or whatever, that that was only a plurality?
03-407 +++$+++ 6603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That was a plurality portion of the opinion.
03-407 +++$+++ 6604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it shouldn't be cited then. You're citing it for something that the Court didn't hold.
03-407 +++$+++ 6605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, actually we've cited it in our brief only for the article III proposition which this Court unanimously agreed that the doctors had article III standing because there was an economic energy --
03-407 +++$+++ 6606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- I thought you were citing it here for the quite different proposition that -- that you can raise third party rights.
03-407 +++$+++ 6607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But ultimately this Court in Singleton allowed the doctors' claim on behalf of the patients to proceed. I understand that it was a plurality opinion on the -- on the jus tertii standing.
03-407 +++$+++ 6608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I could accept -- I guess I probably would accept your position if I did not think there -- there was another equally workable alternative here. And I didn't understand your answer to my earlier question in which you said, if I recall correctly, that it would be unethical for these lawyers to represent a -- a future client, subject to a claim to be paid and on behalf both of the client and, I suppose, of themselves, but essentially on behalf of a client, say, there is a right to State money to pay the lawyer who is representing them. It would be, as I understood you to say, unethical for the lawyer to proceed on that basis. And I don't understand the reason for your answer.
03-407 +++$+++ 6609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think I might have misunderstood your question, Justice Souter. The question I understood was why don't they represent people and raise only the entitlement to right to counsel. In the Bulger case, for example, the Michigan Supreme Court --
03-407 +++$+++ 6624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's all you've got to get up here.
03-407 +++$+++ 6625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's at least an argument.
03-407 +++$+++ 6626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's an argument.
03-407 +++$+++ 6627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And even if they lose on it, they still will have -- would have raised the issue that you are most concerned about getting raised. They're not -- they're not so much interested in the so many dollars for this particular representation. Even if they lose on what seems to me at least a close argument, they will have raised the question you're trying to raise today.
03-407 +++$+++ 6628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And they will have to do so without any prospect of being paid, and that's -- that's the problem.
03-407 +++$+++ 6629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Who's paying them for this lawsuit?
03-407 +++$+++ 6630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're not being paid for this lawsuit.
03-407 +++$+++ 6631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. Exactly the same situation. They can -- they can bring the case directly for the client they're representing just as readily as they can bring this one. And if that is true, why is there an impediment to raising the issue unless we recognize third party standing?
03-407 +++$+++ 6632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because Justice Souter, they would have to represent them on all of their issues. They would have to represent them on their plea and sentencing issues without being paid. And that's not what they're doing in this --
03-407 +++$+++ 6633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Without being paid if they lose --
03-407 +++$+++ 6634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- in this litigation.
03-407 +++$+++ 6635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- being paid if they win. In this case, if they win, they don't get a dime because they're not representing a client. All they get is a declaration.
03-407 +++$+++ 6636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And --
03-407 +++$+++ 6637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And they'd be better off to represent a real client.
03-407 +++$+++ 6638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. They have a shot at getting paid using this other method.
03-407 +++$+++ 6639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In -- in this lawsuit, if we win on the merits, they will then get far more appointments on the rotation system and then they will get paid for those appointments.
03-407 +++$+++ 6640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why will they get more appointments?
03-407 +++$+++ 6641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because --
03-407 +++$+++ 6642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought you said there's a strict rotation system. When your name comes up, you get an appointment. How is that going to change regardless of how this comes out?
03-407 +++$+++ 6643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because the statute, which is now in effect -- and this goes, by the way, back to the issue of prudential standing --
03-407 +++$+++ 6644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, you're just saying there -- there's going to be a further class of clients to be represented on the rotation.
03-407 +++$+++ 6645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct. Far more.
03-407 +++$+++ 6646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay, but that's -- that's true.
03-407 +++$+++ 6647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and while this Court considers these issues of prudential standing, thousands of Michigan defendants will be denied the right to counsel --
03-407 +++$+++ 6648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And while this suit is being brought, we can't do the simple thing, which is to take a case from an indigent who's raising it that we happen to have on our docket and face it directly because everybody is tied up in these knots on standing. I mean, what -- what is it that -- that you -- led you to bring this case rather than just filing an amicus brief in a case brought by a real indigent who wants a lawyer?
03-407 +++$+++ 6649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because there -- there was no person in position at the time. The problem was we had to file this litigation before the statute went into effect because once the statute went into effect, thousands of Michigan indigents would be denied the right to counsel every year and would suffer probably irreparable damage to their right to appeal --
03-407 +++$+++ 6650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I see -- I see that. That's a good answer. And the -- the question I have is if I now, since we have real indigents, believe that there absolutely is a way for a real indigent to raise this claim that isn't even hard, you could file an amicus brief. Suppose I believed that, and I do believe it actually. If I believe it, then does your third party standing claim disappear?
03-407 +++$+++ 6651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
03-407 +++$+++ 6652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. Now, if it doesn't disappear and I hold in your favor, would I then be opening the door to any lawyer whose pocketbook is hurt by tort reform, by any change at all, you know, that means less money for him, and we'd be besieged with people? Instead of the clients, we'd have all the lawyers in complaining that they want to be richer. Now, that's what's worrying me. So on my assumption, how could I possibly decide in your favor without opening that door?
03-407 +++$+++ 6653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your --
03-407 +++$+++ 6654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's the question I'd like answered.
03-407 +++$+++ 6655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, the only kind of case to which this applies is a case exactly like Triplett, a case exactly like Caplin & Drysdale where the claim is that the underlying change in the law or the underlying law disenfranchises or disentitles the indigent or the criminal defendant or the defendant to representation.
03-407 +++$+++ 6656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because?
03-407 +++$+++ 6657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because, first of all, if the indigent or the client still has representation, then there is no hindrance to the third party raising it themselves.
03-407 +++$+++ 6658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is that? Why would a change in substantive law --
03-407 +++$+++ 6659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. I assumed there's --
03-407 +++$+++ 6660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- have the same result? Suppose there's a change in -- in the antitrust law and -- and the person says this change -- this change has the -- the effect of -- of denying me equal protection of the law. That's the claim that the -- that the client would have. But there's a lawyer who says, my goodness, this change will mean there are many -- many fewer antitrust suits. I can demonstrate that. That's my specialty, antitrust law. I'm going to lose a lot of business. Why wouldn't he have the right to raise the equal protection claim of the prospective client?
03-407 +++$+++ 6661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because the client could raise it directly, represented by the attorney. And so the third prong in jus tertii standing would be clearly missing in that case.
03-407 +++$+++ 6662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I'm sorry. I -- I -- Justice Scalia and I were assuming the same thing. If I assume that there's no problem with the real person, the indigent, raising the claim himself -- and I'm saying on that assumption, which I believe, then if I were to decide in your favor, how would I not be opening the door that I wanted to keep firmly closed?
03-407 +++$+++ 6663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But this Court's precedents indicate, Justice Breyer, that the indigents do have a significant hindrance to filing their claims themselves.
03-407 +++$+++ 6664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, okay. No. I agree with you. If in fact you think that there's a problem about a real indigent bringing a claim in Michigan, although we have two on the docket, if I accepted that premise, I would begin to think you were right. So then what I was trying to explore is whether the whole thing comes down to whether I accept that premise. And of course, that's what's everybody has been talking about, and I do see at the moment a couple of very good ways that indigents can bring it themselves, and indeed they have.
03-407 +++$+++ 6665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I think --
03-407 +++$+++ 6666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But everything comes down to that. Right?
03-407 +++$+++ 6667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think an answer I need to give to -- to cut through all of this is that third party standing is never predicated on the impossible. Third party standing is never predicated on the idea that third party standing is appropriate only if it is impossible for some indigent to make it into court or some third party or the person whose rights are being violated to make it into court. All that must be shown from this Court's precedents is a hindrance. So this Court did not require in Craig v. Boren that it was impossible that some young man could get his claim in front of the court.
03-407 +++$+++ 6668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was altogether possible there had been a young man. The problem was he turned 21. So the case would -- from his point of view was moot.
03-407 +++$+++ 6669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, but this Court never suggested that it was -- showing that it was impossible for someone to quickly get his claim before the court was --
03-407 +++$+++ 6670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think I agree with you on that. I'm just -- the reason I think it's so easy is because we get indigents. We get thousands of them. And all you have to have is some indigent saying, hey, I want a lawyer. Okay? That's all. He has to be able to write those words. And at that point, you and the others come in with amicus briefs, if necessary, and support him.
03-407 +++$+++ 6671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the problem is is that in the meantime thousands of Michigan indigents are going to be denied counsel.
03-407 +++$+++ 6672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you a practical question about what is currently before the Court? Mr. Casey I think told us that the Halbert case is on for the October 8th conference. If we should grant cert in either of those direct from the Michigan Supreme Court -- Michigan Supreme Court following Bulger, so you always leave before then. If we should grant in either of those cases, wouldn't the wise thing be to simply hold this case till those are decided?
03-407 +++$+++ 6673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That may well be a wise course of action -- action, Justice Ginsburg. I should point out that Mr. Casey, when he filed the response to the Bulger cert petition, brought this Court's attention to the fact that this underlying litigation was proceeding in a case that was then called Tesmer v. Granholm. And so he brought to this Court's attention that we had already prevailed in Federal district court in Tesmer v. Granholm as a suggestion as to why this Court did not need to grant cert in the Bulger case, and so this Court did not grant cert. I don't know, of course -- I don't know why this Court did not grant cert in Bulger.
03-407 +++$+++ 6674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But he said now he's not taking that position in the Halbert case.
03-407 +++$+++ 6675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I can be confident that if there are any procedural hurdles to this Court's exercise of jurisdiction in any of the State cases, Mr. Casey will alert this Court of them. And there may well be. For example, in the Melody Harris case, the Michigan Supreme Court remanded for further -- remanded for her to then file an application for leave to appeal on her underlying plea and sentencing issues without the assistance of counsel. Was the Michigan Supreme Court's order a final order? I don't know. This Court would obviously have to resolve that. But I can be confident that Mr. Casey will certainly bring up any procedural hurdles. And of course, this Court cannot exercise jurisdiction it does not have in a case just because it would be more convenient to do so. This Court does have jurisdiction in this case. The petitioners never challenged prudential standing at any point in this litigation -- they -- they challenged only article III standing, injury in fact -- until this Court. And so part of the reason we don't have a better record is because this came on a motion to dismiss. This Court recognized in Lujan that a motion to dismiss is different than a summary judgment, requires a -- a different procedural posture. It requires the assumption of facts being true.
03-407 +++$+++ 6676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but no facts -- no additional facts would -- would affect the central point that -- that we've been devoting most of this discussion to, which is whether there is an impediment or not to -- to the -- the actual individuals whose rights your clients are asserting raising their own rights. No additional facts bear upon that it seems to me.
03-407 +++$+++ 6677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I agree with you on that, Justice Scalia.
03-407 +++$+++ 6678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then what case holds that there must be an impediment for the third party? I keep coming back to Craig against Boren. They could have filed another class action and say that they filed a class action and had standing. Would we have suddenly decided we won't decide the merits even though it's been argued and both sides have had their day in court?
03-407 +++$+++ 6679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I agree with you, Justice Stevens.
03-407 +++$+++ 6680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is the source of the requirement there must be an impediment to the third party suit?
03-407 +++$+++ 6681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, this Court has said so many times, and Powers v. Ohio, for example, noted the impediment to the --
03-407 +++$+++ 6682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- where they granted standing.
03-407 +++$+++ 6683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right.
03-407 +++$+++ 6684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Have they ever denied standing on the ground that there was no impediment to the third party suit? I don't think we have.
03-407 +++$+++ 6685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't believe in all of the cases that both parties cited that there are any cases in which this Court has said that there was no impediment to the third party. It is -- it is certainly not the standard --
03-407 +++$+++ 6686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, do you think that was just idle observation then?
03-407 +++$+++ 6687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice. I didn't mean to be light about that.
03-407 +++$+++ 6688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't have to be idle to be dicta, though, does it?
03-407 +++$+++ 6689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There -- we -- we fully concede there need to be an impediment, but what it does not require is the showing that it is impossible for someone to get here. What is a showing is that for most -- for the average person in the class, just like the average grand juror in Campbell v. Louisiana, or the average venire person in Powers v. Ohio, there are impediments to getting here.
03-407 +++$+++ 6690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you fully concede there must be an impediment even though the Court has never so held?
03-407 +++$+++ 6691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm willing to concede that because it is so clear to me that there is, that there is an impediment that trying to get into Federal court, trying to get here, for that matter, trying to get into Federal district court -- for an indigent, a typical person who is very likely -- someone like Mr. Carter, functionally illiterate, poorly educated, completely unaware of his rights, to try and navigate the -- the procedural hurdles of the Michigan system to get all the way through the Michigan system and then into Federal court, that is a daunting hurdle. And that's Evitts v. Lucey. This Court has recognized time and time again in -- in plea cases, Roe v. -- Roe v. Flores-Ortega. This Court has recognized time and time again in Peguero that even in a plea case a typical indigent is completely incapable of getting his or her case held -- heard, especially if you have to go through multiple layers of appeal without a counsel for the first tier. And that is the problem here. On the merits, I certainly would like to correct Mr. Casey's representations about the -- the nature of the Michigan system. The -- a properly filed application for leave to appeal is invariably denied for lack of merit in the grounds presented. I certainly urge this Court to look at each and every one of the cases that Mr. Casey has cited for the proposition that that is not a determination on the merits because not one of them says that. Not one of them specifically says that a order denying leave for lack of merit on the grounds presented is not a decision on the merits.
03-407 +++$+++ 6692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could -- could you give me an example, just from your experience in practice, where there's an important issue raised after a guilty plea that requires an appeal where it's not one of the statutory exceptions?
03-407 +++$+++ 6693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Many, many.
03-407 +++$+++ 6694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Most -- what are -- what are those cases?
03-407 +++$+++ 6695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Improper denial of jail credit, making -- improper denial of jail credit.
03-407 +++$+++ 6696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not sentencing?
03-407 +++$+++ 6697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is a sentencing error.
03-407 +++$+++ 6698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay, but that's covered by the statute.
03-407 +++$+++ 6699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it's not. The statute -- the only exceptions in the statute are for guidelines departures --
03-407 +++$+++ 6700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
03-407 +++$+++ 6701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and for -- and then if the indigent gets the appeal granted, but that's putting -- that's after the indigent has had to file an application identifying his or her own issues without any assistance of counsel. Double jeopardy issues. Double jeopardy issues arise in Michigan all the time; whether sentences should be consecutive or concurrent; whether there's been a breach of the plea bargain. All of these issues arise in Michigan courts every day, and while we are --
03-407 +++$+++ 6702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are there instances where Michigan has denied the right to appeal when those claims are raised?
03-407 +++$+++ 6703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The problem, Your Honor, is that an indigent can't raise -- a typical indigent would be completely incapable of identifying this -- these sorts of issues.
03-407 +++$+++ 6704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ His counsel will have raised them. And -- and most, if not all, of those have to have been raised by counsel.
03-407 +++$+++ 6705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, Michigan requires that ineffective assistance of counsel claims be raised on direct appeal. So if counsel has not raised the issue, then the indigent would have to recognize that by -- by himself, and then raise that issue, the ineffective assistance of counsel, on direct appeal. Further, even if counsel has recognized it, what we typically would have would be an oral objection at a sentencing hearing. For example, Your Honor, I think these sentences should be concurrent, and the judge says, no, I'm going to make them consecutive. That's an oral objection. The indigent will have to be able to get the transcripts, get the register of actions, get all the necessary documents, realize that that's a winning issue, that it does not put him at additional risk. That's another factor. One of the -- one of the points that a counsel can help with is tell an indigent, you don't want to take this appeal because success may result in revocation of the plea bargain and an additional risk -- will have to realize that this is in my best interest to go ahead with this appeal. This is my issue. Find the cases, find the controlling authority. And even issues as complex as a Blakely issue, which this Court, of course, will be dealing with this afternoon, that is an open issue of Michigan law right now. Is -- are the Michigan sentencing guidelines unconstitutional or at least the application of them as a result of this Court's decision in Blakely? Right now, as a result of the order in Melody Harris, a typical Michigan indigent will have to raise that complex issue of Sixth Amendment law by herself or by himself, and that's simply an impossible burden, or the issue will be lost forever. And that is -- that is a burden that no indigent can meet. And so I would hope that this Court would not get hung up on the standing issue because this issue is so important right now, as a result of the Michigan Supreme Court's order. Right now these issues are happening and right now Michigan indigents are being denied the assistance of counsel. Unique in the Nation. And so this case has been adversely argued. That's the point of prudential standing. The petitioners waived the prudential standing issues below. They challenged only article III standing. And so there is every reason for this Court not to wait for a perfect case that may never come.
03-407 +++$+++ 6706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are you familiar with the Halbert case? You mentioned that there might be a finality problem in Harris.
03-407 +++$+++ 6707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MORAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not familiar with that case, Your Honor. I just became aware of it by letter a few days ago and I have not had a chance to find out anything more about it. I have not seen the cert petition in that case. I'm not aware of the underlying -- excuse me -- the underlying order from the Michigan courts in that case. But there may never be a perfect case, but this case is adverse and that meets all the -- all the requirements for prudential standing. Article III standing is clearly met in this case, and I hope this Court will affirm the decision of the Sixth Circuit. If this Court has no further questions.
03-407 +++$+++ 6708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Moran. Mr. Casey, you have 3 minutes left.
03-407 +++$+++ 6710 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Did you waive the objection to prudential standing --
03-407 +++$+++ 6711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We did not waive any of the standing claims in this case. We've discussed that in our reply brief. I've cited pages of the briefs where these issues were discussed. And the overriding fact is that the district court, the three-judge panel in the court of appeals, and the en banc Sixth Circuit all decided these issues. They have been properly raised and preserved and they're before the Court.
03-407 +++$+++ 6712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Did you file a brief in opposition in Halbert?
03-407 +++$+++ 6713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I did. I filed that about a month ago.
03-407 +++$+++ 6714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And does that have any procedural impediments?
03-407 +++$+++ 6715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not to my knowledge. That individual was convicted in pleas, asked for counsel citing the Federal litigation in this Kowalski v. Tesmer case. It was denied. He filed a pro se application for leave to appeal challenging the denial of counsel and raising his sentencing issues --
03-407 +++$+++ 6716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So what was the basis for your opposition to cert?
03-407 +++$+++ 6717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CASEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That the Court need not grant cert in that case because the issue is pending in this case. If -- if this case goes away, then I suspect we will agree that that would be an appropriate vehicle to decide the constitutional issue. As long as this case is pending in which the issue is raised, I suggested that the Court need not grant cert in that case to decide the issue. If the issue is not going to be decided in this case, then that would be an appropriate vehicle to raise and decide the issue. On the standing point, if the plaintiffs here are given standing, it would be a significant expansion of this Court's standing doctrine. This Court has never found third party standing when a litigant is not directly affected by a statute and there is no close existing relationship with the third party and there is no hindrance. We've discussed many cases in which some of these factors are present and others are distinguishing factors. This -- this case is, in some respects, unlike all of them. There would be a significant expansion of the doctrine. On the merits of the issue, a constitutional right to appointed counsel, under the Michigan system, please read the cases I've cited in my brief, particularly the Bobenal decision, which I've cited in my principal brief. In a footnote in my brief, I quote the orders that the court of appeals was considering. They have the same language that is at issue here. Controlling Michigan precedent says that applications for leave to appeal are not decisions on the merits. All an inmate has to do is identify the issues. That can be done. It has been done, as seen by the two pending petitions for cert. If the Court has no further questions.
03-407 +++$+++ 6718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Casey. The case is submitted.
03-409 +++$+++ 6722 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument now on number 03-409, KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. versus Lasting Impression, Inc. Mr. Machat?
03-409 +++$+++ 6724 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case concerns whether or not a defendant in a trademark case who fulfills the statutory requirements of the fair-use defense must also demonstrate an absence of likelihood of confusion in order to avail himself of that affirmative defense. Now, here are four reasons why that should not be the case. In the first place, if that is the case it would render the defense useless, because if there is no likelihood of confusion, then there's no trademark infringement to begin with, so why should someone try to prove an affirmative defense when there's no trademark infringement? Second --
03-409 +++$+++ 6725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You agree with Judge Niemeyer's comment in the Fourth Circuit case, I take it.
03-409 +++$+++ 6726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Secondly, what it does is, is it shifts the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant. There's no reason ever to -- there's no reason ever to prove an absence of likelihood of confusion if you're a defendant. And then, also there's no reason to prove the fair-use defense if you have to also prove an absence of likelihood of confusion, because it's just much more of a burden. You have to prove, first of all --
03-409 +++$+++ 6727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In this case, did the plaintiff offer any evidence of confusion, consumer confusion?
03-409 +++$+++ 6728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This was a motion for summary judgement.
03-409 +++$+++ 6729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And was there anything in the affidavits or attachments that have to do with consumer confusion on behalf of the plaintiff?
03-409 +++$+++ 6730 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yeah, actually, the record does contain some references to confusion. The -- in this case, the respondent, they were claiming that they did have some people that actually were confused. And when that happens, you need to look at what is causing the confusion. And essentially --
03-409 +++$+++ 6731 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it might make it necessary for a defendant in such a situation, in order to avoid some kind of summary judgement, to also offer evidence on consumer confusion to try to show there wasn't any.
03-409 +++$+++ 6732 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but that's shifting the issue, then, to whether or not there's likelihood of confusion. However, even if there -- what I'm saying is even if there is confusion, if you meet the elements of the fair-use defense, it doesn't matter if there's any resulting confusion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6733 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, is it possible that showing consumer confusion could be considered by the court on the issue of what's the fair use? What's fair?
03-409 +++$+++ 6734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the thing is, a lot of times when there is confusion, that is evidence that the term or the word being used is not being used as a mark, so the confusion illustrates that -- one of the elements of the fair-use defense, whether or not the term is being used descriptively or as a mark, whether or not those elements are being met. The confusion does not go to the likelihood of confusion issue; rather, it goes to the individual elements of the fair-use --
03-409 +++$+++ 6735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but I'm interested in Justice O'Connor's point. Suppose it's a close case as to whether or not the use is in good faith and it's only discretion. With reference to good faith, suppose there's very substantial confusion that's caused by the allegedly infringing mark. Does that at least bear on a good-faith assessment? In other words, suppose that it were shown that the owner of the non-registered mark, the alleged infringing mark, used the phrase -- not the mark, but used the phrase -- deliberately in order to cause confusion. Would that --
03-409 +++$+++ 6736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes -- well, that would show an absence of good faith, and good faith is one of the elements of the fair-use defense.
03-409 +++$+++ 6737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, so that if you know that there's going to be confusion, there is no good faith? You wouldn't go that far.
03-409 +++$+++ 6738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I wouldn't go that far. It's a balancing Test and that's why it says "fairly and in good faith," and you have to look at how descriptive the word is, in particular. For instance, if you're using the word "best" -- as in "best buy" or "best foods" -- I mean, best is an extremely descriptive word. So you could go a lot further in claiming, "Hey, I have the best -- I have the best food," or, you know, "Come to my store. I have the best buy." And, yes, there could be confusion, but that is one of the risks that --
03-409 +++$+++ 6739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, is it your position that subjective good faith is always a defense, no matter how unreasonable it is or how much confusion results? Is that your position?
03-409 +++$+++ 6740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I wouldn't go that far, because you also have to look at the objective use.
03-409 +++$+++ 6741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would have thought that consumer confusion is one factor in determining fairness; perhaps not subjective good faith, but certainly on the issue of fairness. Some of the amici take that position, do they not?
03-409 +++$+++ 6742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think -- I was reading the amici brief last night. I think the issue of confusion, as the INTA brief points out, you have to look at whether the confusion is illustrative of whether or not the term is being used as a mark or not. The same evidence that shows confusion can be used to show a likelihood of confusion on the plaintiff's side of the case, and that same evidence can also be used to -- in the case of determining whether or not the elements of a fair use defense have been -- have been met.
03-409 +++$+++ 6743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What did -- what did the district court do here? Did it grant summary judgement or deny summary judgement?
03-409 +++$+++ 6744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- well, the district court granted summary judgement on a fair-use defense. It found that, in this case, the mark was being used -- sorry, that my client's words were being used not as a mark, only to describe, and that the use was done fairly and in good faith. The Ninth Circuit --
03-409 +++$+++ 6745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the district court -- the district court -- this way -- [Laughter.]
03-409 +++$+++ 6746 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- seemed to focus on the use of the word "micro color," just the word. It didn't bring up what was new in 1999. That is, a brochure appears where "micro color" is not simply a word, but it appears in a logo-like fashion. And as I understand it, the district court said you could use "micro color" as you had been using it since 1991. It didn't refer to the stylized 1999 new brochure. So --
03-409 +++$+++ 6747 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, that is correct. The district court, in its opinion, did not specifically refer to that use in 1999.
03-409 +++$+++ 6748 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it might not have been confusion just by using the word. But when you're using it in the logo-like appearance, maybe that's different.
03-409 +++$+++ 6749 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in the abstract case, it could be. I would argue, though, in this case it's not, because that was one use on a -- you have a ten-page brochure, and it's one use on a ten-page brochure. And you -- on that same page of the brochure, at the very bottom, it said my client's name, KP Permanent Makeup. So --
03-409 +++$+++ 6750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that wouldn't relate to the question presented here, anyway. It wouldn't relate to the reason for which we took this case.
03-409 +++$+++ 6751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct.
03-409 +++$+++ 6752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, maybe the district court misinterpreted or misapplied "fairly and in good faith" if it didn't consider the logo-like use. But, as I understand it, the only question we have before us is whether the "fairly and in good faith" provision is an exception even when there is confusion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I would agree.
03-409 +++$+++ 6754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that -- I'm -- and I'm mixed up. I thought that the issue is whether you, on your side, have to present evidence of no confusion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6755 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I think --
03-409 +++$+++ 6756 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So as far as --
03-409 +++$+++ 6757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- I think we're both saying the same thing
03-409 +++$+++ 6758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So as far as Justice O'Connor's question is concerned, I thought your answer would be, if they want to go and present evidence that there is confusion, to the point where it's so obviously unfair, it's ridiculous, they can do it. I mean, do you object to that?
03-409 +++$+++ 6759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I agree.
03-409 +++$+++ 6760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. So your answer to her question is, of course it could be relevant. Let the other side come in and show that it's relevant. You don't have to show that there is no confusion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
03-409 +++$+++ 6762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's where we are, is that right?
03-409 +++$+++ 6763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly --
03-409 +++$+++ 6764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
03-409 +++$+++ 6765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- where we are.
03-409 +++$+++ 6766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could you give us a -- I'd be much more sympathetic to your case if I could readily envision a situation where there is confusion but, nonetheless, the use is fair and in good faith. Give me a clear example.
03-409 +++$+++ 6767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In my particular case? This --
03-409 +++$+++ 6768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I mean, make up one --
03-409 +++$+++ 6769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
03-409 +++$+++ 6770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that's really clear.
03-409 +++$+++ 6771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let's use the words "best buy." Best Buy is a famous consumer electronics store, and somebody opens up a shop, say Mark's, that says, "Mark's, he has the best buy." He wants to advertise on radio, "Come down to Mark's Electronics for the best buy - for the best buy in consumer electronics, go to Mark's," and he keeps using those words "best buy."
03-409 +++$+++ 6772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think there's any likelihood of confusion there, do you? I mean --
03-409 +++$+++ 6773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-409 +++$+++ 6774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- what if he just takes out an ad that says, "Best Buy," exclamation point? That would be closer.
03-409 +++$+++ 6775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, in that case there would be confusion, but Mark, in that case, would be using "best buy" as a trademark, not only to describe; and, therefore, he would not fulfill the statutory requirements of a fair use defense. Because a lot of times when confusion comes up, it comes up in the case that --
03-409 +++$+++ 6776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I didn't mean to make it that in my hypothetical. You're just putting it in bold type at the beginning of the piece, "Best Buy," exclamation point. That means it's a trademark?
03-409 +++$+++ 6777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it would be evidence that it is a trademark. You have to -- it depends how big the words "best buy" were in relation to the word "Mark's Electronics."
03-409 +++$+++ 6778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but if you had a -- if you had a headline at the head of an ad, "Great Sale," that surely is not a trademark, just because you have it in boldfaced print.
03-409 +++$+++ 6779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I agree, it's not necessarily a trademark. You have to look at the totality of the ad, and you have to look at what the person is trying to use to tell consumers to identify and distinguish the products, or, in this case, the store.
03-409 +++$+++ 6780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I suppose if you have a sign that says "Park `n Fly" and an arrow, with a capital "P" and a capital "F," then it's arguably being used as a trademark.
03-409 +++$+++ 6781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
03-409 +++$+++ 6782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Whereas, if you say in a brochure, "Rent a car from us, and park and fly," then that's okay. Is that the distinction?
03-409 +++$+++ 6783 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but I'd go even further and say that the -- if you had a big sign that said "Park `n Fly," and it's next to an airport, that would not necessarily be a trademark. I mean, if it said, like, "Jerry's Airport Parking, Park and Fly," I would say that's being a descriptive use. But some people may argue differently in that case.
03-409 +++$+++ 6784 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit, as I understand it, did put an initial burden on the trademark-holder to prove confusion. If you look at the petition for cert, 6a, in its opinion, it seems to recognize that the trademark-holder must show that the alleged infringer's use of the mark is likely to cause confusion or to cause mistake or to deceive. So this opinion starts out by saying, "Yes, we know that under the Lanham Act the trademark-holder is obliged to show likelihood of confusion."
03-409 +++$+++ 6785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They do it. But then on -- if you look on page 17a of my cert petition, the same opinion, the Ninth Circuit later on go on to say, in the middle paragraph, "As expressed in Kahn's, the fair-use analysis only complements the likelihood of confusion -- likelihood of customer confusion analysis." And then they quote from Transgo, and they say -- explain that "anyone is free to use a term in its primary descriptive sense as long as such use does not result in consumer confusion as to the source of goods." In effect, what they're doing is, they're expanding the rights of trademark-holders of descriptive words. Essentially what they're saying is --
03-409 +++$+++ 6786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they go further in that same paragraph, and the last couple of lines refer to a Lindy Pen case, according to -- the way they described, explaining that the fair-use defense is not available if likelihood of confusion has been shown.
03-409 +++$+++ 6787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, and that's -- that's where they're negating what they said in the beginning of their opinion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They do have one authority for that proposition. They cite McCarthy, and I think they're right about that.
03-409 +++$+++ 6789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they do cite McCarthy, but I would submit that McCarthy is incorrect, in this case.
03-409 +++$+++ 6790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there is a treatise writer who does take the position that if there's confusion, there's no fair-use defense.
03-409 +++$+++ 6791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there are other treatise writers -- Kane, for example, takes the contrary position and says that fair use will always be a defense, even if -even if there is likelihood of confusion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So does the -- what is it -- the unfair competition restatement?
03-409 +++$+++ 6793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, that takes a similar position, as well, that there can be confusion and fair use at the same time. Again, you have to look at what's causing the confusion. And most often the problem is the confusion is being caused because the person with the words in question is using it as a mark, and that's causing the confusion. If -- there's certain -- there's certain -- there's certain terms and words that Congress has said never get trademark protection. Descriptive words, of course, is one of them, in the sense that they can never get trademark protection in their primary descriptive sense; they only get trademark protection in their -- in their secondary-meaning sense if they can actually prove secondary meaning.
03-409 +++$+++ 6794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I thought we're dealing with an incontestable mark here, and the secondary meaning would be assumed.
03-409 +++$+++ 6795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MACHAT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. In the case of an incontestable mark, secondary meaning is presumed; however, that still does not take away the burden of the holder of an incontestable mark of proving likelihood of confusion. And, second, the trademark protection attaches only to the secondary meaning of the mark, never to the primary, descriptive meaning of the words in question. And one other quick example. The laws say you cannot obtain a trademark in the U.S. flag. Now, we have 12 ice-cream manufacturers, they each put the flag on their ice cream. There will be confusion there. Someone will say, "I want the ice cream with the flag on it." But they all have a flag on it. That's another example where Congress said, "We will tolerate confusion." Sometimes we tolerate confusion so we can free up descriptive words so business owners are free to describe their goods to consumers. And, if I may, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
03-409 +++$+++ 6796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Very well, Mr. Machat. Now, Ms. Millett, we'll hear from you.
03-409 +++$+++ 6798 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Justice Scalia, you asked for an example of a case where there might be confusion, but there would still be a fair use. This Court's decision in William Warner versus Eli Lilly, which was a common-law case cited on page 27 of our brief, gives an example of that. You had Coco-quinine, and Quin-coco being sold. And this Court held, as a matter of the common law fair-use doctrine, that the descriptive -- fair, truthful, descriptive use of a term to describe a product will be permitted even if consumer mistakes result. There are other cases cited in the briefs. Howe Scale is cited in our brief. The Canal Company versus Clark case. The fair-use defense that's at issue here takes its -- has its roots in that common law precedent, and that common law precedent, in origin, speaks directly, Justice O'Connor, to your -- and Justice Kennedy -- to your questions about, what does a fairness component of this test in the statute mean. There is not a general requirement that the -- say, the defendant here; the parties were reversed, but the non-trademark holder acts fairly. That's not what Congress said. It says the term -- and I'm -- and you can see, on page 9a of the statutory appendix to our brief -- the term has to be used fairly and in good faith -- putting that aside, used fairly only to describe the product. That is not some sort of general equitable receptacle for fairness concerns. That focuses on what the defendant did and how they acted in describing. That's not a test of how the public reacted. How did the defendant behave? Which is exactly what William Warner, Canal Company, and Howe Scale also looked at. In common parlance, in a common dictionary meaning, when you talk about fairly describing something, that's not general equity. That is, is it a legitimate, reasonable, proper, objectively apt, and fair way to describe a product. One could reasonably --
03-409 +++$+++ 6799 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE O'CONNOR +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, does -- does consumer -- if substantial consumer confusion is shown by the plaintiff, is that enough to defeat a fair-use defense?
03-409 +++$+++ 6800 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not by itself, no, Justice O'Connor. Congress told us what will defeat the defense, and that is a -- that is a conclusion that the term is being used as a mark. Consumer confusion might be, if you could explain that that demonstrates that it's being used as a mark. It might show that you're not objectively, reasonably, accurately describing your product. If I describe Twinkies as a sugary snack, that's a -- I can fairly describe Twinkies as a sugary snack. I can't fairly describe Twinkies as a healthy food.
03-409 +++$+++ 6801 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose, in the Coco-quinine case, the non -- the non-holder is doing just fine without using the particular term, and then he decides, "you know, I'm going to cut into that market, and I'm going to use the term Coco-quinine. And I'm going to do that just in order to get more customers away from the trademark-holder." Is that good faith?
03-409 +++$+++ 6802 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, because there's nothing, in the marketplace, with wanting to increase your business and to do better and to use descriptive terms descriptively to do that. The good-faith --
03-409 +++$+++ 6803 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what --
03-409 +++$+++ 6804 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- continued here --
03-409 +++$+++ 6805 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- what if he intends to increase his market share precisely by causing the confusion? That would eliminate the good-faith element, wouldn't it?
03-409 +++$+++ 6806 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The good-faith element is, do I intend -- it depends on what you mean by "causing confusion." If I intend to freeload or ride or exploit the secondary --
03-409 +++$+++ 6807 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yeah.
03-409 +++$+++ 6808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- meaning of the term --
03-409 +++$+++ 6809 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-409 +++$+++ 6810 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that's what good faith means in trademark law, generally. It has an established component.
03-409 +++$+++ 6811 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-409 +++$+++ 6812 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If I intend to do that. But just showing that consumer confusion could result, or that I hope consumers will pause and think about, you know, "what -- what's in the -- what am I now being offered in the marketplace?" But I have to -- if I intend to avail myself of the secondary meaning that you've established of the goodwill that you've generated, that's what good faith goes to. But to use fairly to describe is not a general means of just saying --
03-409 +++$+++ 6813 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask you --
03-409 +++$+++ 6814 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- if there's confusion, that's a bad --
03-409 +++$+++ 6815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What does the term "micro color" describe?
03-409 +++$+++ 6816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The term "micro color" describes -- this is not my area of expertise, but -- describes, as I understand it, the inks that are used for this permanent make-up process. And the reason it's called "micro color" --
03-409 +++$+++ 6817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does it have a meaning in any context other than describing the -- one party's product in this case?
03-409 +++$+++ 6818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I wouldn't begin to know whether other professions or occupations use the term "micro color." But my understanding, from the record, is that the color is obvious. That's -- it's different color inks. And the reason that they use the term "micro" -- and this is on page, I believe, 98 of the first volume of the joint appendix, is that the molecular size of these inks is very, very fine. It's going into the skin. It's micron-size. And so that's, I think, the -- as suggested by petitioner's client -- that that's the origin of the term "micro color." Now, "micro" is a common term that's -- common descriptive term in its own right. It appears in many contexts. Obviously, computers is one that we're all familiar with. Medical devices often will refer to "micro." But "micro color" --
03-409 +++$+++ 6819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wasn't there -- wasn't there something to the effect that "micro pigmentation" is a synonym in the trade for permanent make-up? It's another name for permanent make-up, and it's -- it has "micro" in it, "micro pigmentation."
03-409 +++$+++ 6820 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's my understanding, yes.
03-409 +++$+++ 6821 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ "Micro pigmentation" sounds awfully close to "micro color."
03-409 +++$+++ 6822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ "Micro color," yeah. That's my understanding. Again, I don't really want to weigh in on one side of the dispute or the other on the merits of whether "micro color" is a generic or a --
03-409 +++$+++ 6823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you have to weigh in on it. I mean, you have to show that the -- it seems to me, if you think that side should win, that the words are being used in a descriptive sense. And if "micro color" doesn't mean a blessed thing to anybody unless they associate it with the trademark, then, it seems to me, you lose.
03-409 +++$+++ 6824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Justice Scalia, the problem here is that the Ninth Circuit said that what makes them lose is not that they didn't use this fairly to describe their product, or not that they failed to act in good faith, or not that they were using this as a trademark, but that it was a --
03-409 +++$+++ 6825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're right, that's not the issue in the case.
03-409 +++$+++ 6826 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. Right. And my understanding -- again, the record shows that, in fact, the descriptive use of this was conceded in this case, and that's on page 29a of the petition appendix, and also in the joint appendix on 152.
03-409 +++$+++ 6827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're right.
03-409 +++$+++ 6828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, again, our concern is that this statute has to be read with the terms Congress enacted. Congress drew a balance here. Congress struck the balance between allowing -- giving unprecedented protection that this Court recognized in "Park 'n Fly" to descriptive terms, but policing the line between the secondary meaning that attaches to descriptive terms and the -- reserving for the marketplace, for competition, the availability of descriptive terms in their original descriptive sense.
03-409 +++$+++ 6829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In other words, if you choose to use a descriptive term as your logo, you take your chances --
03-409 +++$+++ 6830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Exactly.
03-409 +++$+++ 6831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that that descriptive term will be used fairly and in good faith by somebody else and cause confusion.
03-409 +++$+++ 6832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Exactly.
03-409 +++$+++ 6833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And if you don't want confusion, pick a term that isn't descriptive.
03-409 +++$+++ 6834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly right. There's a tradeoff. When you pick a descriptive term, you get right up front, right up front, the immediate appeal and resonance of a term to the -- to the consumers. "Best buy." Who wouldn't want the best buy? I want the best buy. "Chunky" candy bars. It's going to be easier to break into the marketplace with "Chunky" candy bars or "Almond Joy" candy bars, because consumers will have a sense of what they're getting, than if you come in with a --
03-409 +++$+++ 6835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ "Schwartz," "Schwartz" candy bars.
03-409 +++$+++ 6836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ "Schwartz" candy bar, "Kodak," I don't know
03-409 +++$+++ 6837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't do anything for you. [Laughter.]
03-409 +++$+++ 6838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know why that is, and why would I want to eat it. They're going to have to do more work. But the downside, the tradeoff, is, as you said, Justice Scalia, that you do not get to take those terms out of usage. Trademark law protects usage, not words. And if the usage is descriptive, and it's fair, in the sense that it's reasonable, apt, and accurate, as this Court said in William Warner, Canal Company, Howe Scale, in the unfair-competition sense; and the Kellogg versus National Biscuit Company, the Shredded Wheat case, if it's apt and accurate, that's what "used fairly" means. And if its satisfies that objective test, and if it satisfies the subjective good-faith test, and it's not used as a mark, we will tolerate that confusion, because that --
03-409 +++$+++ 6839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do you tell whether it's used as a mark? I mean, is that -- that certainly seems to be central. Is it used as a mark? And if it's used as a mark, then there is a violation.
03-409 +++$+++ 6840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The fair-use defense is unavailable if it's used as a mark. There are other --
03-409 +++$+++ 6841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
03-409 +++$+++ 6842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- defenses that are available, but the fair-use defense is, by definition, unavailable. That's correct. The way you prove whether something is used as a mark -- there's, sort of, two ways of getting to that end. When something is used as a mark, that means it is signifying to the origin or source of those goods in the marketplace. It's not just describing it, it's telling you who is making it or who is putting it out on the market.
03-409 +++$+++ 6843 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So let's go back to the use on the brochure of a logo-like -- I mean, as long as they're using just the word "micro color," I see your position entirely, it's used descriptively, not as a mark. But what about when they use something that looks like a mark?
03-409 +++$+++ 6844 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MILLETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there's -- there's going to be difficult questions of proof. Our position is that, by taking a descriptive term, you don't get to consign everybody else to ten point Times New Roman font, and that they can do some colorful display, but not a mark.
03-409 +++$+++ 6845 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Ms. Millett. Ms. Brinkmann, we'll hear from you.
03-409 +++$+++ 6847 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. BRINKMANN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Defendant's - Petitioner's absolute defense is contrary to the text, purpose, structure and history of the fair-use defense of the Lanham Act. In response to Justice Scalia's question about this is the risk that someone takes when they choose a descriptive term, this defense does not apply only to descriptive terms. Under Petitioner's view, this defense would be available to users of arbitrary, fanciful and suggestive marks so long as they were used descriptively and not as a mark.

And of course I would read the language of the commentary and the INCB and the opinion of our former ambassador, Herbert Okun, in Brazil and France. But let me also say, if I may, that the position of the executive, until this -- until this litigation, has been the same. And the reason we know that is precisely what you said, Your Honor. Mescaline is also covered by the Treaty. Peyote is not. The Native --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I --

04-1084 +++$+++ 13212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- thought that's because we made a special reservation for peyote.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Mr. Chief Justice. We did make a special reservation, but it didn't matter yet, because it's never been covered. That reservation, if you go back and look at what the Senate said at the time, and what -- there are no plants. They're just not listed in the Treaty. The purpose of the reservation was, in an abundance of caution, in case it would be -- in case it would be added in the future, then plants, and solutions from plants, would be covered. But as it stands now, members of the Native American Church drink a tea containing peyote and --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, are you --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- mescaline.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- saying that there are -- there's basically an ambiguity in the Treaty, that solutions derived from plants are not covered, but solutions that include DMT are covered, and there -- therefore, there is a question?
04-1084 +++$+++ 13217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- yes, the ambiguity arises because what the Treaty means is that if you were to extract the DMT and then add it to something, which can't be done here and could have no religious meaning for the UDV, and we're not even sure if -- chemically, if it's possible. If you were to extract it and then add it, then you would have a solution containing DMT. And that's --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But solution is defined by the number of steps in the process that gets the substance into the water? Is that --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- correct?
04-1084 +++$+++ 13221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- Your Honor, I didn't write this Treaty, and I -- and I must say -- [Laughter.]

04-1084 +++$+++ 13223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that it --

04-1084 +++$+++ 13228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not the clear -- the clearest writing, but we know -- we know what its meaning is, and we do have to look at the travaux, which goes into long detail about why they even mention plants, because of their fear, in the future, that plants might be covered. Now, other plants are covered --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- in a different Treaty. But --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I make a suggestion as to why, even if it is covered by the Treaty, it may not be a compelling State interest to comply with the Treaty?
04-1084 +++$+++ 13232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Say yes. Let me him make that --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. [Laughter.]
04-1084 +++$+++ 13234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm just waiting. [Laughter.]
04-1084 +++$+++ 13235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was the right answer.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm just trying --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because I haven't --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to be polite.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- it made. I -- I mean, isn't it well-established that statutes trump treaties, that if Congress decides, in a subsequent statute, to ignore a Treaty, it may do so? Now, if this RFRA can trump a statute, it would seem to me, a fortiori, it can trump a Treaty.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, it can, Your Honor. It can trump the Treaty, and that -- and that is --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So, compliance --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- correct.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- with a Treaty is not necessarily a compelling State interest.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is not. And -- but we don't even have to go that far, because, if we do the RFRA analysis, the Government must show a compelling interest to the person and, in addition --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, surely --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- surely RFRA doesn't say that you disregard treaties or you disregard statutes in determining what's a compelling interest.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. You don't disregard them, Your Honor, but --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And getting back to the first question that Justice Breyer asked -- and then we got off on what the Treaty really means -- but assuming that the Treaty does prohibit the importation of this substance -- assuming that -- is there any evidence that the District Court thought that this was a compelling interest?
04-1084 +++$+++ 13250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the -- no, the District Court --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ None at all.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- analyzed the Treaty differently, and analyzed the Treaty to not apply to hoasca, for all the reasons that are -- that are in his opinion in our brief. And, therefore --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So, if we disagree with you on the Treaty, then the appellate court's opinion doesn't really even address the point whether or not this and/or the statute, together, can be a compelling interest.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. If you disagree with the District Court on that, then the case should be remanded for it to -- for additional --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't know if there isn't a factual question here. I mean, I thought Justice Scalia, if it were to be up to him, did take into account official commentaries to treaties. But maybe he doesn't. Anyway, I take them into account. And I -- and in respect to that, I read this as saying, specifically, that the plants -- it doesn't include the substance if it is a substance clearly distinguished from the substance constituting its active principal -- and the example they give is mimosa root, which contains DMT.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's true. And --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And then, that's also true of the bananas and pineapples, et cetera. And there's a court holding that hoasca's out of it, in France and one in the Netherlands, all of which I think was relevant to a Treaty. All right? Now, the Government has come in with a counterargument and said it clearly does cover, I guess, even mimosa roots, where they are imported solely for the purpose of extracting DMT. Now, what's the response to that?
04-1084 +++$+++ 13258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The response to that, Your Honor, is that there is no DMT extracted in this case. Although the Government said that in their brief, there is no evidence of that, and it is contrary to the evidence --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it has to be extracted at some point to be -- to get into -- I'm right here -- to get into the tea, right? It's extracted by the preparation of the tea.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Mr. Chief --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The plants are not -- the plants are not imported, right? Just the tea.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The tea is imported. But the --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- but the tea is made just like you would make tea if you mixed chamomile and mint, and then --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and then you took the leaves out. What you have --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- in that tea is a collection of a tremendous number of alkaloids. And what the commentary is saying is that you would have to pull this alkaloid out. And that would be a chemical process. There's further -- there's further --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I guess I -- if I could just go back to the point. You're emphasizing that the Treaty doesn't cover the importation of plants. But you're not importing plants, you're --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- importing a mixture that must contain the covered hallucinogen or it doesn't have its effect.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. However, under the Treaty, it's not -- it's not covered by the Treaty, because it is not separate. If DMT were separated, then it would be covered by the Treaty. And, actually, if you look at the 1988 Treaty, going even farther, and its commentary, the commentary in the 1988 Treaty, which has to be read in connection with the 1971 Treaty, specifically defines preparation as the extraction --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So, under your --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- of the drug.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- theory, a marijuana tea would not be covered by the Treaty.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not by this Treaty. But that -- marijuana, coca leaves and poppies are specifically covered by the 1961 Treaty.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but they're not being imported, they're transformed into this tea. And you -- saying the active substance isn't there independently, so it's not covered. And that seems to me to be a -- an erroneous reading of the Treaty.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the difference, for example, with marijuana, is that if you look at the 1961 Treaty, it says "the plant, all parts of the plant, everything from the plant." It's all covered. What the 1971 Treaty did was different. And if you read the 1971 Treaty and the 1988 Treaty and their commentaries, if I can rely on their commentaries, and the International Narcotics Control Board, what they are expressing is a concern for the traditional religious and mystical use of plants in religion, and that's what they were concerned about, and that's why they didn't put this in, and that's why they specifically have, in the commentary, that the example of mimosa -- and they also have an example of peyote in the same paragraph 12, where they --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ About commentary or travaux, I don't mind using them for treaties, so long as they don't contradict the Treaty. Do we have any case where we use the -- les travaux preparatoires to actually contradict the language of the Treaty?
04-1084 +++$+++ 13280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not to my --
04-1084 +++$+++ 13281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's what, it seems to me, is going on here.
04-1084 +++$+++ 13282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HOLLANDER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor, it's not contradicting the Treaty, because the Government is taking this one sentence preparation, and the Government has a definition of it, for this litigation only, that is contrary to the definition in the Treaty the way it is interpreted by the travaux and by the commentary, and by this executive, which means that the executive's position here is really entitled to no deference; because, otherwise, the tea drunk by the Native American Church, the peyote tea, would also be covered.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33882 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Olson, isn't one of the questions whether the software is really being copied when it's transferred from the golden disk to the new manufacturer, or whether it's actually being supplied?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33883 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is being copied. There isn't any question that it's being copied, Justice Stevens. The stipulation which is in pages 44-A through 47-A of the petition appendix contains the words -- this is words to which respondent stipulated -- foreign-made copies replicated object code, foreign manufactured copies, foreign replicated object code. What happens, Justice Stevens, is that the golden master of the disk which contains the physical manifestation of the object code is read by a machine somewhere outside the United States, looked at and then copied onto another physical medium, either a hard drive or a disk. Many hard drives, many disks. Those foreign replicated physical tangible copies are then installed in computers and they become components of those computers.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33884 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is the master disk a component?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33885 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The master -- well, AT&T has taken two positions on that. We --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33886 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What's your position?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33887 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our position is that it's not a component of the final product computers that are made abroad. What is a component is a replication, a copy of a new hard drive or a new disk that's made a part of those computers which, without which --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33888 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Just the disk but not the information on the disk is the component.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33889 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The information on the disk is of no use to the computer unless it's made into a physical machine readable document -- object.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33890 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- Mr. Olson, that is the position of AT&T as I understand it, that what you call the object code appears in the -- in the computer that it's -- that is what is sent, along with the master disk, and the object code is the critical component, according to AT&T. In fact, wasn't that the first question that you raised, whether digital software code, an intangible sequence of 1's and 0's may be considered a component of a patent, patented invention?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33891 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If I understand your question, Justice Ginsburg, let me answer it this way. AT&T has taken two positions. The most recent position is that it's the intangible object code, the series of 1's and 0's, or instructions to a computer switch to be on or off, that is a component. They also took a position earlier in the case and which is referred to in the stipulation that it was the golden master, the physical manifestation on the -- on a master disk that went abroad that was the component.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33892 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I still would like to know your position. The golden disk is or is not a component?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33893 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is not a component --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33894 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But copies of the golden disk are or are not components?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33895 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The copies, the physical manifestation on a hard drive --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33896 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Physical manifestation?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33897 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our components of the foreign manufactured computers. Those components are not supplied from --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33898 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I suppose if you could, if you made 99 copies, those would be 99 components. Then if you used -- if you're going to make 100 machines. If you used for your disk the master disk for the last copy, then that would have been -- that would -- then the master disk would be a copy, a component of the last machine.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33899 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If -- well, I think, if I understand your question, if you make -- and it depends upon where you make it, where you transfer --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33900 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You make them abroad.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33901 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you make it abroad, that -- and it's -- that is where the component is supplied from. Copies are made abroad. There's no question about that and --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33902 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if the disk, if the golden disk itself after they finish the copies, were used --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33903 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the physical --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33904 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in a hardware, then that would be a component.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33905 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If that physical golden disk were actually put into a computer and used without more.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33906 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'm a little confused, because I thought the golden disk was just one method of getting the software into the new computers. And I thought it was the software which was arguably the component, not any physical manifestation.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33907 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's why I said AT&T has taken two positions. Here's the position that they took in their brief before the court of appeals. Three decades of patent jurisprudence have authoritatively recognized software to be a physical and structural component of patented machines. The problem, Justice Stevens --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33908 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But do you -- what is your view on whether or not software is a component?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33909 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- if I may answer that by saying that people use the word "software" in two different ways. One of which, they use it as the intangible series of 1's and 0's. We submit that the correct way to understand the word "software" is the physical manifestation of that what is called source code, which is made into object code, which is made into machine readable code.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33910 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or at least the correct way to understand component.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33911 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is the correct way to understand the --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33912 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the component then would be either a disk which is put into a computer or the portion of the hard drive to which the code is transferred.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33913 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. As I understand it, Justice Souter, and I think the stipulations make this clear, there's a reference in the stipulations to encoded transmissions but there's a -- but the parties also agree that's the same process as the golden disk. The golden disk is sent abroad. That is read by a machine and then the machine understands -- it's almost as if you were to read physically any other type of document, read it to a machine. The machine understands what is said, puts it into a physical manifestation on a disk or on a hard drive. Many copies are made in that fashion. They are installed in computers made abroad, sold to foreign purchasers.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33914 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So are you saying that neither the source code nor the compilation are a component?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33915 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of the foreign? The language of the statute is the foreign manufactured product. Those are the computers that are sold abroad. It is our position that the only components that are in issue in this case are the physical manifestations of the object code on a hard drive or on a disk.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33916 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that neither the source code nor the compilation are a component, save as, the compilation is put on a disk?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33917 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. And the -- the thing that's on the disk in the foreign --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33918 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That seems odd. I mean, Microsoft doesn't say please buy our disk because it's the prettiest disk in the business.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33919 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Kennedy --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33920 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It says buy our program because the program means something.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33921 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the program is nothing until made into a physical manifestation that can be made by the computer.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33922 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What is patented? Is the physical object patented or is the software patented?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33923 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The AT&T patent --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33924 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33925 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The '580 patent is a program, as I understand it, that's married to a computer, has to be married to a computer in order to be patented.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33926 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You can't patent, you know, on-off, on-off code in the abstract, can you?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33927 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Justice Scalia.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33928 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There needs to be a device.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33929 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ An idea or a principle, two plus two equals four can't be patented. It has to be put together with a machine and made into a usable device. The bind that AT&T is in here is that the components that make the machines run that are produced abroad are not supplied from the United States. They are made in Belgium or Frankfurt or something.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33930 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That depends on what you consider the component. They define component as including the, what you've been calling the abstract.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33931 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They have attempted, Justice Ginsburg, with respect, to have it both ways. They've said that it is a physical and structural thing, something that's on the golden master disk. And then they say it's just the binary code in the abstract, but that in the abstract never becomes a part of the computer.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33932 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What did the Federal Circuit say? And I read the opinion a couple of times and it was, it seemed to me ambiguous whether the Federal Circuit was identifying the component as the object code itself or the master disk.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33933 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. I agree with you. The Federal Circuit was ambiguous, in part because there were two separate decisions. The court considered the component issue in the Eolas case and then when this case came along, said we've already decided the component portion of the statute; now we must decide the supplied from. So the language which the Federal Circuit used is a bit confusing. Basically what it said, though, is that the act of supplying embraces the act of copying. That means that any, any company sending a machine or a patented product abroad, that that machine must be copied in order to be mass produced abroad. It might be a pill. It might be a mousetrap. It might be a Buick. That exact identical copy if replicated abroad does not violate the statutes, the patent laws, it doesn't constitute an infringement.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33934 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose you had a patent on a biological organism and it was contained in a little vial, and you shipped it abroad. Just by doing nothing at all, it grew, and it had -- it grew into 100 different parts.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33935 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If it reproduces itself, Justice Kennedy, somewhere outside the United States --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33936 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33937 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What you're suggesting is that there is a pattern or a recipe or a template or a mold. It could be the same thing. If it's reproduced outside the United States by some laboratory outside the United States, then the components are not being sent from the United States for reassembly abroad.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33938 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't this an artificial distinction in -- when you're talking about the making of a tangible part, there's at least some cost involved in doing it here or doing it abroad, and some time involved. But with, with software, the Federal Circuit's point was that it is so easy and inexpensive and fast to copy it that simply sending the information abroad, sending the object code abroad in the form of the golden disk, is tantamount to manufacturing copies overseas.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33939 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think there are three answers to that. Surely the patent laws cannot be determined according to whether it's easy or fast or efficient to replicate something. There has to be a line that makes some sense. Number two, it may be fast and efficient but there are certainly costs involved in taking the machines to do it. Number three, where would that take us? A design -- every product contains its own manifestation of its design. That would take us everywhere, because any product can be copied abroad. However -- and maybe there are going to be fast ways to produce other things. These are replicas, reproductions, copies. These are not such components that are supplied from the United States. If I may reserve the balance of my time? Thank you.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33940 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Joseffer.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33942 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: It might help if I could start by putting this case into its context in both the United States and international patent law. Section 271(f) is a limited extension of normal territoriality principles that is designed to shore up the prohibition against actually making a patented invention in the United States, but it does not take the further and extraordinary step of applying United States law to the conduct of copying parts abroad for assembly and sale abroad conduct is properly the subject of foreign law. As a result, in the context of traditional manufacturing, for example, it has always been understood pursuant to the statute's text, that while companies cannot make parts in the United States for final assembly abroad -- that's too close to making it here -- they may make copies in a foreign country by, for example, sending the design to the foreign country or sending a specific part to the foreign country that can be copied there. That distinction between copying in the United States and copying in the foreign country has two critical dimensions. The first is that it protects the foreign government's sovereign prerogative to establish the rules of competition that will govern companies that wish to compete in that foreign country's markets by copying their products abroad, assembling them there and selling them there. The second, which is the flip side of that point, is that it enables United States companies to compete on an even playing field abroad against their foreign competitors by manufacturing, assembling, and selling parts abroad, subject --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33943 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Joseffer, to the, to the extent that you are claiming that there are foreign nations that would have an interest in this, usually when that is so, hear from them and in this case there is a strange silence in that regard.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33944 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that -- I can say -- a couple points I can make. One is, this case has, has been viewed because of the Federal Circuit's attempt to tie this to software on the grounds that software can easily be copied abroad, I think this case has been somewhat narrowly viewed as a software case. But in truth, there's no basis for distinguishing software from anything else, and if the Federal Circuit's decision was actually taken to its logical conclusion I have no doubt that other nations would be quite concerned, like in -- in two ways. One is we have looked, not exhaustively but we have looked, and we have not been able to find a single other country that would apply its law in the circumstances if they were reversed. In other words if a German condition wanted to compete in the United States subject to German law by making copies here, assembling them here, selling them here, Germany would stay out of that because it's the United States' prerogative. Also there are significant differences between the nations' patent laws. For software in particular, the United States is much more bullish on the patentability of software-related inventions than many other countries. But even for more mundane reasons, if we were talking about anything -- it could be that the foreign government doesn't think that an invention is particularly novel, it just disagrees with us about that, or it doesn't think there is sufficient advance in the prior art sufficiently inventive to warrant patent protection. And if the foreign country is going to make that determination regarding competition policy in its own borders, it's entitled to make that determination.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33945 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me ask you about a domestic law question. One side is telling us it's the component that's supplied, whether it's the master disk or the object code. And the other side says this is just like a blueprint, like a mold, like a template. Can a blueprint be patented? Can a mold be patented?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33946 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not ordinarily. I mean -- I'm sorry.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33947 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Copyright. Copyright. You normally copyright.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33948 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You can certainly copyright something like that.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33949 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yeah, but patent --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33950 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well the -- no, but the -- I think the most important point here is that the components of patented inventions do not have to be patentable. Many patented inventions are comprised of a bunch of parts where the parts themselves would not be patentable because say they were standard off the shelf parts.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33951 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there can be a process patent.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33952 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, and we don't -- I mean, process patents, a process patent is a series of steps or acts for performing a certain function, such as turning rubber into a tire. We don't think process patents are relevant -- are, are covered by this statute for a couple of reasons. And it's not --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33953 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What, what is your view of what the component is in this case.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33954 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The component is the, is the actual machine readable copy of software that is inserted in --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33955 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The software is the component?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33956 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but the, the -- but like with anything, you could say a computer is also the component, but it's the actual computer, not you know, any copy of the same computer.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33957 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But in this case, you're -- but Mr. Olson said the component is either the disk or the portion of the hard drive to which the, the coded instructions are transferred.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33958 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33959 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you accept that?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33960 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The United States view -- I'm not sure exactly how much we disagree on this -- but the United States view is that, for example, a blank disk is not a component of this invention because you don't need a blank disk to practice this invention. The -- the actual component is the physical substantiation, the physical copy of the software that's inserted into a computer and if you get a disk --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33961 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In other words, the disk plus the -- plus the coded instructions.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33962 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. And again the coded -- the software could be on a disk or it could be on some other technology. It doesn't matter how it --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33963 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It could be on the hard drive.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33964 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And once it's copied on to the hard drive, then the copy on the hard drive is itself a component.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33965 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I take it that we are operating under the assumption that software is patentable? We have never held that in this Court, have we?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33966 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but as I was saying before --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33967 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So what should we do here? Should, if we are writing this, since it's never been held that it's patentable in this Court --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33968 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think if --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33969 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If I were writing something, should I say on the assumption that it's patentable? Since the issue isn't raised?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33970 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I think, I think the reason that's not relevant here is that the patented invention in this case is not software. It's computer that has software loaded into it. And the components of a patented invention do not themselves have to be patented.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33971 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can have you have a copyright on a program?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33972 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Ah, if you wrote it out, yes. If I wrote out a string of 1's and 0's I could copyright the strings of 1's and 0's that was -- that was written out on a piece of paper. But the -- in terms of what the component is here, the other things --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33973 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can I ask you, the point I don't understand when you say the -- the component is the disk that contains material, I understand that because here is a separate piece; it's a disk. You plug it in; it has the information on it. But then you say, if you put it on the hard drive it becomes the component. But the hard drive is not a separate thing like a disk. And when you say you put it on the hard drive you have nothing there but -- but -- but ons and offs. You have nothing there but the -- but the thought.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33974 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33975 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How can you call, you know, what? Is it a separate section of the hard drive? No.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33976 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you could go later in and delete that software off the hard drive which confirms that the software does have a separate physical existence in there. But the main point is that the -- the component is the, is the physical substantiation of the software. The actual copy of the software. It doesn't matter if it's on a hard disk; doesn't mean it's on a disk; it doesn't matter if it's in the air in wireless transmission. It's just the physical copy of the software. And you could have a situation where there are multiple copies of that same component in a computer. One --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33977 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If these -- if these computers are built abroad and are sold with Windows installed, the component is the electrons on the hard drive? Is that what, that's your position?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33978 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's the physical embodiment of the software which in some instances is manifested by -- by those electrons. Now AT&T's contrary view is that the abstract code in the abstract is the component. The reason that can't be is that object code in the abstract is just a series of 1's and 0's. In theory I could memorize in my head or write down on a piece of paper. But that's not going to combine with other, with other parts to make a patented invention. And if I could illustrate that with a simple lock and key example, a key has a series of ridges on it that enable it to open a lock. And that series of ridges can be denoted by a sequence of numbers, bigger numbers for deeper ridges. But the component is the key that actually turns the lock, not the abstract sequence of ridges on the key. And you can then say that about anything; you can always say that any physical product, any physical part, is a physical manifestation of its abstract design.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33979 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that analogous to the source and the compilation, the source being the design, the compilation being the key?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33980 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. The source code and object code are just different computer languages for expressing the same thing. There is no -- there's no difference between them. One is words and one is numbers, but they mean the same thing. There is no reason to treat them differently. The point is just that if you treat the -- either the source code or the object code as the component, that's just the design of the actual physical software that goes into the computer. If you did that you'd have a vastly different statute because any physical part has a design, but the whole point of the statute is to prohibit copying of parts in the United States while permitting copying of parts abroad for sale abroad. But if the design itself was a component then you could never copy parts abroad when something was designed in the United States, because something designed abroad would always infringe because the something designed abroad would itself be the component, and that would be a vastly different statute there's no reason to think Congress intended here, especially because of the extraterritorial consequences.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33981 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Windows wasn't around when this statute was passed.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33982 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the statute was enacted in 1984 when software was certainly present. It's fair to say that Congress was not thinking of software, but that's further caution for not expanding the statute beyond traditional territorial reaches. Because first, this Court has cautioned, has said that it should be cautious in applying existing electrical property statutes to new technologies. And in addition it's emphasized in Deepsouth that the caution against extraterritoriality applies in this very context. So Congress is writing against the backdrop of normal territorial principles, which are the making, using or selling inventions of foreign countries subject only to foreign law, and against the backdrop of Deepsouth, which has specifically held that Congress has to speak clearly to enact of statute like this.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33983 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought it was the position of the Federal Circuit that Deepsouth has to be brought into an electronic era, and so the -- the Federal Circuit was taking a statute that had a shrimp deveiner in mind and saying well, this is how that notion should apply to an electronic world.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33984 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JOSEFFER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. And the reason that doesn't work in the statutory text and policies is that the component that we are talking about here is the specific part that goes in the machine. And if -- and if -- and under the statute you have to let the company send the design abroad to manufacture it abroad, both to protect the company's ability to compete abroad and to protect the foreign government's prerogatives. Otherwise it's just a vastly different statute than the one that Congress enacted. That's really our terms of the politics.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33985 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your time is up, but I want to ask you one yes or no question. In your view is software patentable?

There is no question that Microsoft supplies the Windows object code, that is the precise, machine readable sequence of commands that instructs a computer's processor. From the United States, that is paragraph 7 of the stipulation. There is likewise no question that it does so with the intent that precisely the same sequence, which runs to millions of lines of binary digits, will be installed and stored -- those are Microsoft's words -- in foreign computers precisely so that they may practice AT&T's invention. Those facts resolve this case because it is thus entirely consistent with the ordinary meaning of the words of the statute to say that Microsoft has quote, "supplied" a quote, "component" that when quote, "combined with hardware" enables the practice of AT&T's invention. Now let's look at --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33990 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose I send someone to the Patent Office --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33991 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Excuse me?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33992 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose I send someone to the Patent Office, goes there, picks up the patent, and this patent is written very, very, very concretely and specifically. Gets on the phone, phones somebody in Germany and reads it to him. And that person, having an excellent memory, takes everything in and now he has the precise instruction necessary to change the machine around or put various things into it. So now it is a precise copy of the machine in the United States.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33993 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not the --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33994 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that -- how is that different from this? How is it different?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33995 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is very different than this case because what -- first of all, we all agree that software code in and of itself, removed from a physical structure, cannot be patentable and when software -- when some -- when an invention that is practiced with software is patented, at the most what you will see is preferred embodiments of the source code which is language that humans understand and which computers do not. A lot of work has to be done in items of debugging and testing and compiling to create what is, by stipulation, at issue in this case, which is the precise, machine readable sequence that commands a computer's CPU millions of times a second. Source code would do nothing. Source code has to be worked on overseas.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33996 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. We have a genius -- we have, as they used to have to get all the stuff that we stole from England, with the -- with the -- remember the weaving machines and the cotton spinners and so forth? This genius comes over here; he looks at a really complex machine; it is now stored in his head, the precise details that nobody else could do. He runs back to Germany, and he builds it. Well, he has absolutely stolen the precise, incredibly complex details of this machine.
05-1056 +++$+++ 33997 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-1056 +++$+++ 33998 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, does it matter, if instead of sending the individual, we send the machine to Germany. This genius looks at it in Germany and there he makes the copy. Are they any different?
05-1056 +++$+++ 33999 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ When you're talking -- when you're talking about sending designs over or blueprints or management instructions or a high level version of, gee let's have a code that will perform the following functions, and you have people design and make and compile and test and debug that code overseas, of course that component, the component is the object code, the precise commands that reside in the computer and continually interact with the hardware of the computer in a way I'm going to describe and is not disputed, millions of times a second. Let's take this case. Okay. Is it -- the question is, is it a component and whether what was supplied was in fact combined. That's, that's -- that's what this case boils down to. As to the component. We have something, software program, the NetMeeting and sound recorded program that can in its object, its machine readable command form, is developed, bought and sold entirely separately from any hardware that it commands.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34000 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that is what is on master disk.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34001 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that is what is either on the master disk or, although either side obscures this, that is what is represented in the electric -- electronic transmission, that is another means by which the code is supplied. And in paragraph 7 of the stipulation Microsoft acknowledges that it supplies the Windows object code by transmitting it to manufacturers overseas. And the way that happens is the code, the machine language, is resident in Redmond, either in the pits and lands of a CD or on the varying magnetic orientations of a hard drive, and a, some engineer from Microsoft presses a button and it is essentially, it is taken and converted into photons which stream whatever it is, 7,000 miles, under the land and under the Atlantic Ocean and emerges into a machine, a computer, a bit of otherwise inanimate parts that are sitting there in Dusseldorf, where it is loaded onto the hard drive, it's converted from photons to a series of electrical pulses.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34002 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that really what happens? As I understand it there is an intermediate step. They don't send it directly from the United States to each of the individual computers in Germany. They send it to a central point which then redistributes it. Is that not right.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34003 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think that paragraph 7 of the stipulation, it doesn't specify one way or the other, but their case, Justice Stevens, depends upon the following. Because if I --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34004 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you're correct that they're just sending from New York direct to the 500 different machines all on one transmission from New York, there's no lawsuit here.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34005 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me give you two examples --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34006 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that what you're trying to tell us, that they do send it directly from New York to 500 different recipients in Germany?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34007 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no. And it wouldn't -- what I'm saying is there is at least one violation of 271(f) here. 271(f) looks exclusively at what is done in the United States. It is entirely irrelevant to 271(f) what, if anything, is done overseas. The Federal Circuit has made this clear in the Waymark case and it's consistent with the language.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34008 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would it be a violation if they sent, if they sent the golden disk abroad and nobody ever copied anything off the golden disk?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34009 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If they sent the golden disk abroad or if the Microsoft engineer --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34010 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would you answer my question?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34011 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think I am. The answer is --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34012 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If they send the golden disk abroad and never use it, would that be a violation?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34013 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If they had the necessary intent and purpose. They had to have had the specific intent and purpose that it be combined in order to create a device that wouldn't --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34014 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose it is never, it is never combined?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34015 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It wouldn't matter.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34016 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you -- and the reason it wouldn't matter on your view is that the component is the object code on the disk, not the disk itself?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34017 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34018 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. Then why doesn't that get you --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34019 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It could be --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34020 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why doesn't that get you right back to the point that Justice Breyer was making? You are saying, I think, in essence if you send a blueprint -- this is like a blueprint. It tells, it tells a machine which may be in Europe how to put the object code on other disks or on hard drives. The machine in Europe is following instructions just the way an artisan would follow a blueprint.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34021 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Here's the difference.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34022 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is the difference?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34023 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it's nicely embodied in Microsoft's reply's use, repeated use of the word "antecedent." A blueprint or a design is a precursor to the actual device. It is the instructions about how to make something. It's not the thing itself. And here what we have is the object code that is the precise commands that, unlike design information, interact continuously with the hard drive and with the processor in order to make physical changes on an ongoing basis.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34024 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but the "continuously" does not describe the process of going from the master disk to what you claim to be the infringing computer sold in Europe. There is no continuous process there. As I understand it, what happens is -- let's just take the master disk and forget the photon for the moment. The master disk functions like a blueprint. They send, from the United States they send the blueprint to Europe. The blueprint is put in some kind of a machine in Europe. And by the use of the blueprint the machine puts electrical charges on a disk or on a hard drive, and that it seems to me does bear out the blueprint analogy. And if it does, then any export of a blueprint or indeed the simple export, the simple sending of the '820, if that's the right number, patent in this case would be a violation.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34025 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I have to disagree, Justice Souter, because the blueprint -- the patent is not the actual series of commands that runs the machine and neither is the blueprint. The blueprint is instructions, to be sure, and it can be reflected in intangible code, but it's instructions about how to make something and once it's made it's done. You can say, as Mr. Olson did, that the design is embodied in the thing that is made. The blueprint for a semiconductor chip in some sense is always reflected in that chip. But if you don't like the chip you have to get rid of it. Software can be -- if you don't like Microsoft Word, you can download it and you can delete it and download WordPerfect and use that. And what happens in the computer -- and I think this does bear on what the nature of the component is and why in the ordinary sense of the word "component" and the ordinary sense of the words "supply" and "combine," they apply naturally to what Microsoft does. I mean, is a disk, is a typewriter, is a screen, is a hard drive, is a CPU a component? Are they components when they have the code embedded in it? Of course. But that doesn't -- a tire doesn't become not a component of a car just because a tire with a wheel attached to it is also a component. The question is --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34026 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But suppose, suppose you had a machine that makes another machine, and if you ship that machine to Europe -- and there's a patent for the machine that makes it. If you ship it to Europe and it starts making another machine, the statute is not violated; and isn't that just what's happening here?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34027 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no. This is not a machine tool. The thing that was violated, the machine readable object code, is precisely what is installed on the computer and precisely what is moved from one part of the computer to another in different forms as the computer operates and it continually instructs. This is dynamic. It's not --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34028 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How would you, how would you -- go back for a second, please, because, if you're finished with that, because I don't see how to decide for you without at the same time permitting a person to walk over to the Patent Office, to read that application and the description, which after all at least can be a very highly detailed set of instructions of how to make a machine, getting on the phone, explaining that just like the blueprint which it is just like to somebody in Europe. They then make it. And that on your reading would violate the statute. It can't be right that that would and you don't even think it would.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34029 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't because --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34030 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And so what's the difference between that and this case for you?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34031 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, there is a long, long spectrum with respect to software that goes, goes from high level system architecture to all the way down through component architecture, pseudo code, source code, which is, which is a description that humans understand, and the actual machine language that a computer will understand. Invention -- patents do not specify machine language. The machine code is totally dependent on what type of processor it's relating to and somebody who takes source code -- I could make an argument that if you take, steal the Microsoft source code, which is the crown jewel, it is the greatest trade secret of this country, it will not be sent overseas, but if somebody took it with a bunch of smart engineers and said, you know, convert this into, convert this into something a computer will understand that will combine with a computer, that involves a question of whether what's going on overseas is manufacture as opposed to assembly. Look at it from the perspective -- maybe this helps. Let's look at the question from the perspective of Microsoft, the OEM, and the user overseas. Object code is the end of Microsoft's manufacturing process. That is what they make. They don't make hard drives, they don't make disks, they don't make computers. They fully finish their product, the Windows operating code, and then send it overseas. The OEM is --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34032 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That, that code is not patentable, you've said.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34033 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The code is not patentable. The expression is copyrightable. AT&T has not sought to get a patent on the code. AT&T has a patent on a system that can be practiced, among other ways, through the use of software.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34034 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what is it that they export and send overseas?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34035 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They export in a variety of different physical forms --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34036 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, it's a thing. It's an object of some sort, isn't it?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34037 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is an intangible sequence of commands that is carrying --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34038 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is an object that has coded onto it, transferred to it in a readable way, those commands. But it's an object, isn't it?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34039 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's not necessarily an object. I don't know whether you would call a stream of photons that is constantly repeated under the Atlantic Ocean an object.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34040 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman, this may, this may help focus that question. Suppose the master disks were made abroad. You would be taking the same position, would you not?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34041 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- that depends how it were made. If it were --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34042 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I hope we can continue calling it the golden disk. It has a certain Scheherazade quality that really adds a lot of interest to this case. (Laughter.)
05-1056 +++$+++ 34043 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the question is what is made. If making it means somehow creating, reconfiguring the precise sequence of commands --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34044 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. That's given by Microsoft to one of its offices in Europe. But the golden disk itself is made abroad.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34045 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the, if the object code itself, the very precise sequence that can't be changed, is supplied from the United States --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34046 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34047 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the act is implicated.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34048 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So the only thing --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34049 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Regardless of --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34050 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The only thing supplied is this, one side calls it abstract, one side calls it something else. But anyway, it is the series of 0's and 1's; that's the only thing that's supplied from the United States?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34051 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34052 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Any physical manifestation of it is done abroad. You would still be taking the position that you're taking, is that not so?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34053 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, yes, except that the intangible sequence of commands can only be carried in the form of, by attaching it to a physical platform or a bucket.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34054 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but it doesn't have to be --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34055 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Even a radio wave. Microsoft has patent claims for software.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34056 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The physical object does not have to originate in the United States. Can they not transmit the commands to a physical object in Germany and have that be the substitute for the golden disk?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34057 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, of course, and they do that.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34058 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34059 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They press a button and they have an electronic transmission that sends a stream of protons under the Atlantic Ocean and are changed into electrical impulses that are used to inscribe the precise code onto a hard drive in the form of electromagnetic pulses.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34060 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that they now send to some central point which redistributes them. They send one copy to, say, the wholesaler, who then makes 500 copies that are sent to the retail customers, isn't that correct?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34061 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That may be. We don't --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34062 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which is exactly what happens in this case?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34063 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's one of the things that happens in this case. We have a stipulated record that is not very detailed, but in that instance there is only one violation.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34064 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My question is if that is what happens, when the retransmission takes place when one copy is converted into 500 how can those 500 all be components rather than copies of the single component?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34065 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the only -- I have two answers to that question, both of them I think directly answering your question. First of all, the statute is violated only when the precise object code is expatriated from the United States, when it is supplied from the United States. That's the violation. The other issues are damages, what damages are you entitled to. What is combined with the computer is the precise thing that is supplied because it is the precise sequence of commands.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34066 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But is there any precedent for that sort of thing? That is, I understand your point now, I think, but however you put it, it has to come down to the fact that this very, very complex and detailed thing that is being supplied is an abstract set of numbers. And I can understand how the patent application does not itself contain that set of numbers, but rather contains an instruction as to how to generate that set of numbers. But I then would be quite frightened of deciding for you and discovering that all over the world there are vast numbers of inventions that really can be thought of in the same way that you're thinking of this one, and suddenly all kinds of transmissions of information themselves and alone become components. So I'm asking you, is there any outside the computer field analogous instance where the transmission of information has itself been viewed as the transmission of a component?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34067 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not aware of any. In the lower courts, Microsoft was arguing that the biotech industry was an analogy, but there is some very obvious differences between what is supplied in terms of object code that instructs a machine and a, you know, a sequence of nucleotides, the abstract sequence of nucleotides. But I think we need to be quite precise here. We are not complaining that the component is an idea. We're not complaining -- we're not arguing that a component is some form of information. What we're saying here is -- I mean, nobody is paying billions of dollars from an idea. When the commands are loaded onto the hard drive of a computer in the form of electromagnetic orientations and when you press a button saying give me NetMeeting, and the processor says -- and this is what electrical engineers say -- fetch the instructions, fetch the commands to the random access memory where it's -- where it is there reflected in a -- in a form of patterns of electrical charges. And when the code then moves back and forth, the instructions move back and forth from the CPU and RAM, they -- they -- millions of times a second they are replicating themselves.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34068 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, is it an answer to Justice Breyer, or maybe it isn't, that we have no conceptual problem saying there would be liability if this happened within the territorial limits of the United States?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34069 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely not.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34070 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And so there shouldn't be a greater conceptual problem if you prevail, in applying it abroad.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34071 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34072 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, sure, there is. It's a bigger --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34073 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I can, I just want to make sure I answer your question.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34074 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it's totally different in that of course it violates the patent in the United States. The whole question here is whether or not the person has to go get a patent in Germany, which he can do or not do. And the -- the concern that I'm worried about is in the future it might be outside your field, it might be in biology, but if you suddenly say that the transmission purely of information is the transmission of a component, no matter how detailed, I can easily see in biology or medicine where a patent has an instruction and indeed, that instruction is an instruction to create other detailed procedures, processes, dishes, Petri dishes, I don't know what it is, and we transmit that detailed information abroad. Then suddenly it's our patent law and not the foreign patent law that would govern. That's why I asked for precedent.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34075 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. First of all, this statute does not reach anything that is done overseas. It doesn't reach what the German OEM does. It doesn't reach what anybody does overseas. It -- it makes liable as an infringer somebody who supplies -- who is in the United States who supplies from the United States a component with the intent, with the express intent that that component be combined in a way to create a device that would practice a U.S. patent. Now I don't believe -- I firmly am confident that if you look at what's at issue in this case, there may be all sorts of questions about what is or isn't a component. I might think that a design is a component or it isn't a component, but think of these three features: One, this is something that is totally modular. It is developed, bought and sold entirely independent of any of the hardware to which it is, with which it is combined, and between which it moves continuously as it operates. Number two, it can be removed or updated entirely independently of the other components. And it is dynamic, unlike designs, unlike molds, unlike instructions about how to make something, all of which are exhausted. They have done their work when the thing is made. That's why those things are called hardware.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34076 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. But --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34077 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ These are instructions not about how to make something. They are instructions about what the other things that are made should do and how they do it.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34078 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You can perfectly well say that in this case. You can say that the instruction is exhausted once the golden disk has sent its information through an intermediary machine onto the new disk that is made.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34079 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You could not say that because if you take the information from a golden master or a stream of photons and put it on a hard drive, unless that continues to move and change in form, the computer will not work. The computer operates by having you press a button saying do this function. The central processing unit then says where are my instructions on how to do it. It says find them and put them in random access memory, where it is then replicated in the form of patterns of electrical charges, quite a different physical form than it exists on the hard drive. And the program counter --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34080 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That simply means that after the -- the -- the -- the idea as you put it, has been placed on the hard drive, certain other processes must take place too before we get the result that people are buying computers to -- to obtain. But it's still the case that the -- that the code on the golden disk is exhausted once that has been transferred from the disk through an intermediary machine on its way ultimately to a working computer just -- and my only point is -- just the way you can say that the blueprint in effect is exhausted once the house has been built.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34081 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not because the blueprint has no further work to do. It was something that --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34082 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. You can use it again.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34083 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Something you teach, has no further work to do with respect to the infringing device, but the object code works continuously and gives continuous instructions to the various hardware components completely unlike. But let me go to --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34084 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The object code has several jobs. One job when embodied on the golden disk is tell a -- is to tell a machine how to make disks or how to put a message on a hard drive. Another job that the object code has is when the object code gets on the resulting disk or the hard drive. But in fact, the manifestation of the object code on the golden disk and the manifestation of the object code on the resulting disk are separable, just as the blueprint is separable from what is constructed.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34085 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, just taking your -- taking that as -- that as the case, the United States in footnote 2 of its brief repeats what Microsoft argued in the court of appeals and the district court, which is that if it took instead of one golden master, but 100,000 CDs, which is what a golden master is, one for each computer, that would be a 271(f) infringement. But that also requires copying and transforming the code that is on the CD-ROM which is in the form of physical pits and lands and indentations, and downloading it into the hard drive where the same exact sequence is manifested as varying orientations of electronic, electromagnetic fields, and that is no different whatsoever than this case. If you say, well, what destroys you in this case is that the code has to be copied, replication, precise instantaneous replication is simply how software works. It's not just how it's supplied. It's not just how it's combined. It's how it interacts dynamically within the computer. And that's why we say it's a component. Let me just be clear about what the statutory interpretation question here is. It's not as whether our conception of the component as the code -- as the -- as the command is better than their conception of the component as a CD or a light wave or a telephone wire that contains that. The question is, there may very -- it may very well be both things. The question is whether the word component naturally applies to what we do. And our -- we have given dozens of references to the use of intangible software, program software as components. We have given you the dictionary definition with an example from Webster's. They have not responded with one counter-example. The only dictionary example they provide you relates to the word "such", and it's in their reply brief on page 5. But they have given you not the first definition of such under Black, in Black's Eighth, they have given you the second one. The first one is, of this or that kind, she collects a variety of things. And that definition, under that definition it wouldn't matter whether you said, well, the component has to be physical or, you know, it could be either. Because even if it has to be physical --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34086 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can you think of any machine -- can you think of any machine other than a computer that has a component that is not a physical thing?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34087 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I can't. And that's why it seems to me, I mean -- and there are -- there are machines that have nonphysical things in them but not that operate in the sort of same dynamic way. We gave the example of the intangible text of Moby Dick in a book. And they give the example of, you know, an incredibly complicated series of circuits on a -- on a chip. But those don't continue to operate and interact in the way that this paradigmatic component does. Thank you.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34088 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Mr. Olson, you have, let's see, four minutes.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34090 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Justice Scalia. I mean Justice Stevens. (Laughter.) I was about to address Justice Scalia and recite the case -- cite the case Nixon versus Fitzgerald, which is directly responsive to the question Justice Scalia raised at the very beginning of the audience, that a stipulation with respect to damages does not make a case moot. And also with respect to a question raised by Justice Scalia, or a comment made by him, it doesn't have to be gold. It's a master disk.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34091 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34092 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What this essentially comes down to is something that Mr. Waxman repeatedly said. It is the commands that are a component. The commands to the individual foreign made computers. Those are -- those commands cannot be understood and cannot be used by that computer unless they are in a physical medium that is created as a copy of the master disk that sends abroad -- that's sent abroad. As I said at the beginning, the stipulation is full of the word "copies", foreign replicated copies. That's what we're talking about here, something that is recreated. And Justice Breyer, your question about someone who's got a really good memory and can go abroad and recite the 1's and 0's, pictures can be taken, copies can be made in lots of different ways. And in response to Justice --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34093 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ His answer to me is that -- that -- it's sort of misleading to think of this as if it's just information, because it's really a method that switches things at a level of detail that is impossible to put in a patent application. It's taking the information in a patent application, it's transforming it into what we think of as 1's and 0's, but they're not really even 1's and 0's. What they are is things that happen with electricity.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34094 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34095 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it's putting that on the disk and then it makes other things happen.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34096 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I agree.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34097 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's putting something physical on a disk, pits and lands, instructions that are copied from the master disk and then put into either a hard drive or a disk, it's the same thing. It's something that is into the computer that will make the computer operate. You're right, Justice Ginsburg, that the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit thought it was bringing this statute up to date and it even said so. We are making an extension of the statute to keep up to date with the technology. That is not for courts to do. This Court is --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34098 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are you saying that the infringement act that happened in the United States involved no components?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34099 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The infringement that happened in the United States which was under Section B, which provides Section B inducement liability for making copies domestically of -- the same thing that happened here. Copies of the object code were put on physical mediums and sent to domestic manufacturers. Domestic reproduction constitutes infringement under Section 271(b) but foreign reproduction is not a violation of Section 271(a) or 271(b). Hence, we're talking about the two sections where --
05-1056 +++$+++ 34100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So they had a license to do that, because if they didn't have a license to make the master disk here in the United States, the making of it would have violated the patent; is that right?
05-1056 +++$+++ 34101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OLSON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The making of the master disk if actually used in a computer with a microphone and a speaker, and that's the liability that existed in the stipulation under 271(a). Making copies is liability domestically under 271(b). If it's going to be liable for foreign made replications, then it must be under 271(f). The language of the statute, we submit is clear. Physical things must be components under 271(f) because they must be supplied from somewhere. Ideas have no physical from. They're in the air. The words used, "supplied from" tells us that it must be a physical thing combined with. Ideas don't combine with physical things to make a patented invention. Physical things do. Thank you, Your Honor.
05-1056 +++$+++ 34102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Olson. The case is submitted.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34107 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in Ledbetter versus Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. Mr. Russell.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34109 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. A jury found that at the time petitioner filed for charge of discrimination with the EEOC, respondent was paying her less for each week's work than it paid similarly situated male employees and that it did so because of her sex. The question for the Court is whether that present act of disparate treatment because of sex constituted a present violation of Title VII. This Court has already answered that question. Consistent with the law's traditional treatment of pay as arising from recurring transactions and giving rise to recurring causes of action, and consistent with the paycheck accrual rule everyone agrees Congress adopted for the Equal Pay Act, this Court in Bazemore versus Friday held under Title VII, each week's paycheck that offers less to an employee because of her race or sex --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34110 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But are you saying that the rule for paycheck decisions is different than the rule for other sorts of decisions?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34111 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it is. For example, the respondents give the example of promotion decisions but we think that there are analytical and well as practical and historical distinctions that Congress, that led Congress to treat pay differently. As a practical matter, while it's always the case or almost always the case that somebody knows they have been subject to disparate treatment in a promotion case -- they know that they didn't get the promotion and somebody else did -- -it is frequently possible for an employee to be subject to disparate pay without ever knowing that she has been treated differently than anybody else. And certainly --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34112 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That seems to me to work the other way around, just like the case we've just heard argued in the last hour. It's a question of specificity here. If the, if the employee, he alleges that promotions were based on experience and the employee didn't have the experience because of past discrimination, why is that different than the paycheck rule? I take it indicates that you would not allow the, a cause of action unless the discrimination was within the statute of limitations period?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34113 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Yes. A promotion -- discrimination in promotion is different analytically than with discrimination with respect to pay decisions themselves. Because in a promotion decision the employee is deprived of the opportunity to take on added responsibilities and therefore earn more pay, but in, but the pay itself is not discriminatory in the sense of treating people doing the same work differently.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34114 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't really see a vast difference between a promotion and being elevated to a higher pay grade. I mean, there may be no different responsibilities but it's a single act of discrimination: "No, you're not going to move up to the next pay level." I don't see why that's different from "no, you're not going to move up to the next job."
05-1074 +++$+++ 34115 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because, I think the difference is that when somebody is denied a promotion for discriminatory reasons the paychecks themselves are not discriminatory. They treat similarly situated workers differently.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34116 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Russell, I thought that your argument was that yes, you know that you haven't got the promotion, you know you haven't got the transfer, but the spread in the pay is an incremental thing. You may think the first year you didn't get a raise, "well, so be it." But you have, you have no reason to think that there is going to be this inequality. I mean she started out getting the same pay, right?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, and that practical distinction I think does support Congress's decision under the Equal Pay Act as well as under Title VII to choose a paycheck accrual rule because it's frequently that even if an employee knows she has been subject to disparate pay, it's frequently very difficult for her to have a good faith belief that that pay is intentionally discriminatory without more information. So for example, if you look at that chart on page 174 of the joint appendix, which summarizes the pay decisions for one of the years at issue here, if petitioner knew only the pay raise that she got that year, she would know that she got a 5.28 percent raise which is not - which is not suspicious. If she knew what Mr. Conte had gotten, she would know that in fact that pay raise decision decreased the disparity between her pay and Mr. Conte's pay. If she knew what also happened with respect to Mr. Bice she would see he got a higher absolute raise than he did, but she got a bigger one than Todd. It's only if petitioner had all of the information in this chart, that she would know that that pay raise decision increased the overall disparity between her wages and the average wages of men doing the same job. And even then the amount of that disparity, standing alone wouldn't provide a sufficient reason to go claim intentional discrimination to the EEOC.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How does, how does time solve that difficulty?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's only after -- one would expect in a merit system that there would be some level of variation in the area and that would work out over time. It's only when it doesn't, when the disparity persists, when the different treatment accrues again and again and the overall disparity in the wages increases, that the employee has some reasonable basis to think that it's not natural variation in the pay decisions but actually intentional discrimination. In the paycheck accrual rule that's been applied by the lower courts for more than 20 years without incident, adequately balances the interest of employees and being able to come forward once they find out that there is a reason to suspect discrimination, with an employer's reasonable interest in avoiding having to defend stale claims. I think it's important to note that the Equal Pay Act, which everybody agrees has a paycheck accrual rule, imposes all of the same burdens on employers that respondents allege would have led Congress to never impose a paycheck accrual under Title VII.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What happened to the Equal Pay Act claim? You started out with a Title VII claim and an equal pay claim and somewhere along the way the equal pay claim dropped out.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It did. The magistrate judge initially recommended dismissing both the Title VII and equal pay claims on the grounds that there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the disparity. The District Courts held that there were fact disputes that precluded that conclusion, but for some reason only reinstated the Title VII claim.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why didn't you ask for the equal pay claim? As I understand the magistrate judge he said, yes, you had made it across the first hurdle, you had a prima facie case. You showed that you're a woman, and you're getting this and all the men are getting much higher. But the employer has come forward with any other factor other than sex and the other factor is that, your inadequate performance.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We should have objected to the failure to reinstate the Equal Pay Act claim. We didn't; we didn't think it was that important and the time because we still had the Title VII claim.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because in the Title VII case assuming you're right, that you get across the same threshold, you're faced with the same defense. Right?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. It's essentially the same case kind of case in each instance. Although the jury has to find intentional discrimination in the Title VII case; under the Equal Pay Act the jury has to determine whether the employer has shown that the present disparity is the result of some factor other than sex. And so in both cases, the jury always has to consider the basis of prior decisions that are the cause of the present disparity.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34126 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you have to show that at the time when a particular paycheck in question is issued, there was an intent to discriminate?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34127 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. The execution of a prior discriminatory decision constitutes a present violation of Title VII. It's frequently --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34128 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What if the situation is that when the particular paycheck is cut, the company, the employer, whoever it is, has no intent whatsoever to discriminate? They think that they are issuing this pay on a totally nondiscriminatory basis?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34129 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It still constitutes a violation because they are executing a present disparity that is because of sex within the meaning of the statute.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34130 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So if 15 years earlier a discriminatory decision was made to give a pay raise of 4 percent rather than 5 percent, and that over the 15 years became the basis with other raises, you think you can challenge the discrimination 15 years later and say well, this was discriminatory because 15 years ago I didn't get a raise and that, carried forward, had a ripple effect into the current 180-day period.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34131 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. That kind of claim would be timely under Section 706. The employer would have an awfully good laches defense.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would that be true if there were a change in ownership of the company, so the discrimination originally occurred under owner A, then the company is purchased by owner B, completely unrelated, and the, the disparity is used for bonuses, etcetera?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That would depend on the general rules for attributing a liability from a successful --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, under the, under the answer that you gave to the Chief Justice and the rule you propose, what of the case of differing ownership?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would think that they are still responsible in the same way that they are responsible for other actions that the prior company took.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that, but that would not be the result if the reason for the disparity between 4 percent and 5 percent was not a, a denial of a pay increase to a higher pay level, but rather denial of a promotion to another job.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34137 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34138 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If that were the case, then it washes out and you have to challenge it right away.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct. And we think --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does that make any sense?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think that it does for the reason that I said before, that that kind of consequence is a secondary effect of the prior unlawful employment practice, but under Evans, which that kind of problem goes to --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you could call it a secondary effect but the only reason you want to get promoted to another job is to get more money. I think it's a primary effect.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well even if the Court didn't think that this is a completely satisfactory analytical line to draw, as I said before there are good practical reasons for drawing it, and every reason to think that Congress did draw it, because Congress enacted this statute against the background legal principle that pay, that the pay aspects of the employment relationship arise out of recurring transactions and give rise to recurring causes of action. And that's the rule that everybody acknowledges Congress adopted under the Equal Pay Act. And to hold that there is a different rule under Title VII would for example lead to the anomalous proposition that Congress intended to permit women, a white woman in 1967 to challenge the present disparity in her pay, but not a black man under Title VII because the discrimination there was racial. We don't think that Congress intended the two acts to perform in such dramatically different ways. In fact --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34144 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Congress could have specifically provided for the Equal Pay Act rule under Title VII, but it didn't do that.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34145 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, it didn't have the same elements, but there's no reason to think that the difference in the elements --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It didn't have the same defenses because the Bennett amendment makes the defenses under the Equal Pay Act applicable under Title VII, right?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right. And as a result the claims and the process of adjudicating both kinds of claims are not significantly different.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose you go back to the 15 year old action which led to disparity that continues up to today, and suppose at the beginning or in July of 2006 the woman discovers it and brings her claim and suppose she wins. Now, is it the case -- and here I'm uncertain. I thought there was some rule in respect to getting damages that you could only go back 2 years?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is a provision of Title VII that limits back pay to at most 2 years.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And in that case would it mean that in this case where it happened 15 years ago and she won, but she didn't bring her act until August of 2006, that she could only then collect the extra money for the preceding 2 years?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So it isn't going to open up tremendous liability for 15 or 20 years ago.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's absolutely right, and in fact there's no reason to think that such claims are particularly common. This has been the rule in effect for 20 years in the lower courts and respondent is unable to show any actual evidence that these kinds of claims are common. But much more common are instances in which an employee has no reasonable basis for filing a charge of discrimination within 180 days of the disparity.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I suppose all they'd have to do is allege that sometime over the past -- I mean, it doesn't have to be 15 years. It could be 40 years, right -- that there was a discriminatory act, in one of the semi-annual pay reviews I was denied this, a raise that I should have gotten. It may have been 20 years ago. It may have been 40 years ago.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They can certainly make that allegation, but the employer is left open to avail itself of the equitable defenses and they'll have a very easy time of showing that there's been undue delay.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where does it say --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why is that if they just discovered it? I just learned about what happened 30 years ago at this company and it's -- I filed right away. There's no laches.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In that case --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But then they have to go back and litigate what happened 30 years ago.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I do acknowledge that a traditional laches defense would be more difficult than those --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought your answer before was that this is not -- if she's going to bring a case I got a 2 percent raise, he got a 3 percent raise, her chances are very slim, but if this builds up year by year to the point where see is saying, I'm being denied equal pay, it's a requirement of the anti-discrimination law that I get equal pay, so today I'm not getting equal pay, I thought -- I mean, the chance that she could win when she gets a salary review and she gets a little less than the other person are nil.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, and it's only after that same kind of decision has been repeated over a number of years that you actually have a case that you can bring to the EEOC. But under respondent's view by that time it's too late.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's not your theory. I mean, if it happened once 20 years ago you have a case that you can bring, isn't it?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true, but the practical --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You've got a memo that says we're going to pay, 20 years ago, we're going to pay males this much and we're going to pay females this much, and she says that obviously affected my pay over the ensuing 15, 20 years.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true, but the paycheck accrual rule also serves the function of the much more common case in which somebody doesn't derive notice of the potential discrimination until the discrimination has been repeated over time.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But isn't your position that an employer violates Title VII unless the employer periodically reviews the entire pay record of every employee to make sure that there has never been an uncomplained of act of discrimination at any point in the past that would have a continuing present effect on the amount of money that the employee is paid?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. They certainly have an incentive to do that under both the Equal Pay Act, which everybody acknowledges puts the employer subject to liability for any present disparity based on any prior decision that can't be justified as based on some factor other than sex, and that incentive has been around for a very long time and respondents aren't able to show that that's been an unmanageable burden. But employers as a matter of basic agency law know from the very beginning whether or not they've been paying the plaintiff less because of her sex.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do they know that? 10 years ago the employee got a particular, got a particular job evaluation and that dictated the amount of pay that that employee was going to get for that period and all, all subsequent pay built on that base, and then it turns out many years later that there was discrimination in the way the employee was evaluated way back when, even though there was no complaint about it; then under your theory that would be a present Title VII violation, to cut a paycheck that built, that was based on pay that was built on this act of discrimination that occurred long ago?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because this Court made clear as recently Faragher that when an employer delegates pay-setting authority to a supervisor the discrimination undertaken by that supervisor is imputed to the employer as a matter of agency law principles.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yeah, but that assumed a present discrimination, and it seems to me the problem that we've got is the problem of connecting a past discrimination with what may in fact be an apparently neutral act 15 or 20 years later.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't think that the proof that the act is discriminatory is any more difficult or any more difficult in concept when it happened several years ago than when it happened 180 days ago. It's still the employer -- the employee still has to show that the present disparity is because of sex. And the fact that it may be more difficult as a practical matter is something that the court can take into account under a laches defense.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does he have to know that the present decision to continue the pay structure is discriminatory?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. It's enough that the employer knows as a matter of basic agency law that the petitioner is being paid less because of her sex, because of prior discriminatory decisions.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- as I remember the facts of this case, wasn't it in 1995 that she got a substantial raise and the reason, according to her supervisor, was that he noticed that her pay was below the minimum of the appropriate range for her job?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true. She did get a higher raise that year and that was his testimony. He also testified that he had told her differently, that she had done a very good job that year and that's why she had gotten it, and the jury was entitled to believe that.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I didn't understand one of your answers. Supposing that today the management does not know of the prior discrimination. Just, records that have been lost, it happened a long time ago. But there was evidence that there was a firm policy that women get 20 percent less than men forever and it's still -- that policy has continued up to date, but that these people making the decision today did not know that. Would there be liability or not?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There would.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought you said the other. That's why I was --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I apologize if I was unclear about that. There would be liability, and basic agency law principles impute to the employer those prior decisions. So it's not possible for Goodyear as a matter of law to claim that it did not know about those decisions when they occurred, and I'm not aware of any principle of agency law --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the question is whether or not there was a discriminatory act and if the employer, let's say it's an employer that has just purchased a business, thinks that it's a neutral criterion to base wages or bonuses or increase on a prior pay scale and he doesn't know about the prior discrimination, why isn't that a defense?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It may be a defense. I'm not quite certain how agency law principles apply in that circumstance when there's been a change of ownership. But certainly when there hasn't been it's not unfair to the employer to say that so long as you base present pay on long past decisions it's your responsibility to make sure that that present pay is not discriminatory.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it's not enough presumably for somebody to come in and even up everybody? I mean, if you see that the women are making 20 percent less than the men you don't escape liability by paying everybody the same going forward, because perhaps if nondiscriminatory decisions had been made the women would have making 20 percent more than the men. You have to go back and revisit every pay decision or you're exposed to liability for current pay.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true, that they have an incentive to do so. They also have that incentive concededly under the Equal Pay Act and nothing in this Court's decision in this case is going to remove that incentive or that burden. And the fact that Congress didn't find that burden inappropriate under the Equal Pay Act is good reason to think that Congress wouldn't have thought it was inappropriate here.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what is your burden to prove? You've talked about their burden to go back when -- do I understand it that your view is that the only thing you have to prove is that in this case a woman was being paid at a rate which is different from the rate of a man doing a comparable job?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, that's not our position. We have to prove in addition that that disparity is because of sex, which necessarily --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you too then have to go, unless you can find a present policy to discriminate on sex, you too in your proof have to go back whatever it may be, you know, the 15 or 20 years?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, and the longer that an employee waits the longer it is for her to sustain her burden of proof on that score. And in fact --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why is that true? I mean, it depends. I suppose it may be harder for the company to mount a defense over time, so it may be to her advantage to wait.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if the employer can show in fact that there is a disadvantage, that there is prejudice, it can ask the court to limit the scope of the claim or eliminate it entirely under an equitable defense such as laches. I think it's important to keep in mind that this is not the first time that this Court has struggled with this question when does the unlawful employment practice occur in a disparate pay case. This Court confronted precisely that question in Bazemore and held that -- and rejected the Fourth Circuit's interpretation in that case that the present payment of a disparate wage was simply a consequence and not in itself a present violation of Title VII?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What do you say of the explanation that was given in Bazemore? I forget the subsequent case. It was in footnote 6. You know what I mean. Which referred to Bazemore as a case that involved a present discrimination which, which is inconsistent with your theory. What do you say about footnote 6?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think it's inconsistent. There was present discrimination. There was, people were being paid less and it was because of their race. It just so happened that the because of their race was based on a decision that was made before the effective date of the act. I don't think --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the policy -- I thought the assumption was that the policy was in fact a policy which, which was sort of currently honored and intended to be honored by the company, whereas the case that we're concerned about is the case in which there was a discriminatory act, you know, 5, 10, 15 years ago. Nobody remembers the discrimination now. It's just that it continues to have these ripple effect consequences. I would have thought that the subsequent explanation in Bazemore would have been inconsistent with your position with respect to the current ripple effect.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I don't think that's an accurate description of what was going on in Bazemore. Recall, for example, that there were plaintiffs in Bazemore --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, do you take -- I'm sorry, I can't think of the name of the case. You know the case that I'm talking about with the footnote?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Lorance?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I guess. Do you think that the Court in the footnote misstated Bazemore and that therefore we should trust to Bazemore and not the subsequent explanation?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I thought -- I'd take the footnote in Lorance, if that's what you're referring to, to simply say that, like a facially discriminatory pay policy which discriminates every time it's implemented, a facially discriminatory seniority policy that discriminates every time it's implemented, the Court was -- considered in Bazemore a similar kind of recurring violation because, just like a facially discriminatory policy, a discriminatory pay structure or pay decision treats differently -- similarly situated people differently every time it's implemented.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that assumes that the company in effect says, we have a pay structure and our pay structure as it is now treats people differently depending on sex, race, or whatever. And that's not the kind -- that's something very different from the ripple effect argument.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think that it is. For example, remember that in Bazemore there were plaintiffs, workers who were hired after the merger, after 1965, and when they were hired they were paid the same rate as the white employees, and the disparity in their wages in 1972 arose solely because of the discriminatory application of a merit-based pay raise decision, system, which is exactly the same kind of claim that we're making in this case. But this Court nonetheless held that continuing to pay workers, those workers, less than similarly situated whites because of that discrimination that occurred before the effective date of the act was still a present violation of Title VII.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me ask this question. Supposing in the annual review before a promotion is concerned the officer making the recommendation was instructed not only to decide what increase would be appropriate but also to review past history and decide whether or not the employee was being paid fairly in a nondiscriminatory basis and that was part of the assignment. Would you have a case if that were the case?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The plaintiff would be required to show that that de novo decision was intentionally discriminatory.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You couldn't rely on the past history in that situation?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because I think that's sort of what Justice -- Judge Jofla thought was going on here.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think that he -- he couldn't have thought that because the facts are absolutely clear and Goodyear acknowledges in this Court that the pay system that they had in place simply made an annual decision whether to make a marginal increase into the raise and took the prior salary as given. If I could, before I sit down, I'd like to make the point that to the extent the Court doesn't think Bazemore decides this case, and doesn't think that the statute is clear on this question, it should defer to the expert opinion of the EEOC on this question in which they have particular expertise because they see thousands of these claims every year. They know better than anybody else whether the paycheck accrual rule is unworkable in practice, or that the pay decision accrual rule will lead to the elimination of many claims that Congress would have intended to preserve. If I could reserve the remainder of my time.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you counsel. Mr. Nager, we'll hear now from you.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34209 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court has repeatedly said that a claim of intentional discrimination is timely and actionable only if it concerns intentionally discriminatory acts taken during Title VII's charge filing period. And the question presented in this case asks the Court to hold that a disparity in pay states a timely actionable claim for intentional discrimination if it is merely the result of allegedly discriminatory actions taken outside of the charge filing period. The question presented is inconsistent with holding after holding of this Court. When Goodyear issued paychecks during the charge filing period, it did not commit intentionally discriminatory acts. No one at Goodyear took Miss Ledbetter's sex into account during the charge filing period in deciding what to pay her.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Nager, can I test your theory with a hypothetical question? Supposing 20 years ago, there was an actual written policy statement, we pay women 20 percent less than men. And that was written up and everybody knew it. And then nothing changed for the next 20 years, and the person then sued today. Would she be -- and there was no intent to do anything, this is just the way it's always been. Would she have a cause of action?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The answer to that, I think, is no, if I understand your hypothetical, if the employer was not intending to classify on the basis of gender.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If present intent was merely to do what we have always done, you have to go back 20 years to find out that what we have always done is the result of a policy decision made 20 years ago that we can hire women at a less expense than men so we will continue to pay the same rate. Would the per paycheck rule apply to that case?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the answer is it clearly would be untimely insofar as the allegation is that there is discrimination today merely because there was discrimination yesterday. Whether or not there is discrimination going on during the charge filing period, whether or not women are intentionally being treated differently than men, I think the answer, based upon your hypothetical, is no, given what you've said.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the employer had a policy of paying women, all women, 20 percent less than men, and it continued that policy, surely it would know in the present day when it issued those paychecks that it was paying women less than men. So it would be intentionally discriminating at this time, wouldn't it?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Alito, that's why I qualified my answer to Justice Stevens, because I think that the question his hypothetical raises, like your question, goes to the sufficiency of evidence necessary to prove intent during the charge filing period. And I don't want in any way to be heard that there is anything in our position in this case that tries to answer that question. The reason I'm not trying to answer that question in this case is because that question is not before the Court except with one small respect. If the only thing that the plaintiff is relying upon is discrimination outside of the charge filing period, that is legally insufficient under this Court's cases in Evans, Ricks, Lorance and Machinists before it. What Bazemore dealt with was a case very much like your hypothetical, Justice Alito, of an allegation of an ongoing racial classification during the actionable time period. And it was because of that allegation of ongoing actionable racial classification and pay that there was both a timely claim, and according to Justice Brennan's opinion for all nine members of the Court of that -- in that case, a very serious potential error by the district court in that case as to whether or not it had been clearly erroneous in holding that the United States had failed its proof of proving an ongoing intentional race discrimination case --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Nager, why did it make any sense to treat this area any different from the Equal Pay Act.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because they are two different statutes and the elements of the plaintiff's claims are fundamentally different. That's the fundamental flaw in the petitioner's claim in this case. Let me explain, if I may, Justice Scalia. In a Title VII case, in an intentional discrimination case, the question is whether or not there is an act that is motivated by gender during the charge filing period. That is not an element of the plaintiff's cause of action in an Equal Pay Act case. In an Equal Pay Act case, all the plaintiff has to do is allege they are performing equal work to a male, and that they are paid differently. And it's that cause of action that triggers the statute of limitations in an Equal Pay Act case. That's fundamentally different. As Chief Justice Roberts said --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is it different if the one further statement was made. And the employer knew that every woman is being paid less than every man. Why isn't that sufficient under Title VII, and if you want evidence, your own supervisor said, oh, we saw one year that she was outside the range appropriate for this job.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, knowledge is a necessary condition, but it's not a sufficient condition, Justice Ginsburg. In Evans, the employer knew it previously had a sexual -- a gender-based discriminatory policy about whether or not female flight attendants could work after they got married. But that prior knowledge of prior discrimination by the employer wasn't sufficient to make the neutral action taken --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Evans involved a factor that simply is not present here. I mean, Evans involved a seniority system. And if this person who had been off the job were to come back two years later, and bump people who had been there every day, well, certainly that's a different case than this one, where she is saying, I should have been paid equally. I wasn't. And I know I can go back only two years. That's quite a bit different than the Evans situation.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, Title VII allows proof of dissimilar treatment as evidence of present intentional discrimination, but it's not the elements of the claim. As Chief Justice Roberts was pointing out, Title VII would prohibit paying a woman the same amount as a male if the employer would have paid the female more because she had a -- more degrees or other criteria that the employer ordinarily took into account. The elements of those two claims are fundamentally different. What makes this case untimely and unactionable is that there is no claim and there can be no claim because it's the law of the case that Goodyear took Miss Ledbetter's sex into account during the charge filing period. What Goodyear did was the same kind of neutral rule as in Evans. What Goodyear did was it said, we are looking at the pay rate contained in our payroll system, and applying those rates as they are mandated for all of our employees, male or female. And what Goodyear did at the beginning of each evaluation period was say, we are starting this payroll period with the pay rates that were paid in the last period for all of our employees, male or female, no matter what their prior causes.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If only the 180 day period counts, and she can complain only about discrimination in that period, then how do you account for her being able to go back not 180 days, but two years for her remedy?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The two-year rule is only a damages rule that applies only in Title VII cases. And it's triggered in cases such as where there has been equitable tolling or equitable estoppel, because the employer -- it was a promotion case or a pay case --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought it was the lid on the amount of compensation you could get in Title VII cases. You can't go back more than two years for damages. But it would seem that doesn't fit at all whether you can go back only 180 days.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. What the 180 days is for is determining the time period during which the allegedly illegal act must occur. That period can be tolled using a tolling rule. It can tolled for three years possibly. The back pay rule says, even if you tolled the statute of limitations for more than the two-year back pay period, you can only get back pay for two years. What is going on, of course, in this case, is they are trying to use allegedly discriminatory acts that occurred 10, 15, 20 years ago, both to make neutral acts actionable, and to get compensatory and punitive damages.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is she claiming that in 1995, a supervisor recognized that my pay was way out of line. Isn't that what the supervisor testified?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He did. And he said he raised her pay up the maximum amount he was entitled to that year. And she didn't file a charge of discrimination in 1995.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Maybe she thought that, well, they are on the right track. Next year, they are going to raise me up to the equal pay level.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what the purpose of the charge filing requirement under Title VII, as this Court has repeatedly said, is to require that employee to come forward promptly within 180 days of the date that the alleged unlawful employment action is communicated to her, and bring that claim or lose it, that the purpose of Section 706 was to create repose.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The question that I asked Mr. Nager that I think is really important, and that is, where do you put these pay cases? Do you put it in the box with the hostile environment that builds up over time, and as long as the environment is hostile at the time you bring your complaint, then it doesn't matter that it started 20 years ago. This notion of one year, it's 2 percent, and the other person got 3 percent, you really don't have an effective claim unless it builds up to the point where there is a noticeable disparity.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the petitioner in this case has agreed with us that this is the kind of discrete employment action that triggers the 180-day period. It is not like a sexual harassment claim.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where is that agreement?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's in their brief. They repeatedly quote the portion of Morgan which described pay claims as discrete acts subject to the discrete trigger rule in the Morgan opinion. And that, of course, is an obvious concession that they had to make in this case, because Mr. Russell would not concede when Justice Scalia asked that that first pay rate decision was not an identifiable act, that it wasn't an actionable -- immediately actionable claim.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought that the Morgan decision quotes Bazemore for saying, under Title VII, each week's paycheck that delivered less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong, actionable under Title VII.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's in the portion of the opinion that's dealing with discrete employment action. It's not in the portion of the opinion dealing with sexual harassment claims. I'm trying to answer your question about which portion of Morgan pay claims fall into.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Whatever portion it's in, it says each week's paycheck that delivered less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong, actionable --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because Justice Thomas' opinion was accurately describing the holding in Bazemore on the facts of Bazemore, because in Bazemore there was a claim, in contrast to this case, of ongoing intentional race discrimination in classifying employees on the basis of their race and paying the black employees less than the whites. If the Court would look at the remand order in the Bazemore case, they'll see that the Court did not remand with instructions that judgment be entered for the United States merely because there was a disparity in salaries.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Brennan's opinion sounds to me, part one, as if he is saying what the mistake was that the company made here is that they didn't really eradicate the effects of the past bad act, and they were trying to eradicate it.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, actually, the United States' allegations in the case were trying --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's another part of the case that's part two and part three about the evidence that came in. In fact, there are about six other parts. I'm just talking about part one.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's part one.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. All right. So I read that. Now, this is my this is my cost/benefit analysis here. If we follow the other side's rule, it's very simple, we just said Bazemore applies, whether there's a practice or whether it was a discrete thing, or whatever, so it's simple. But we do have to distinguish pay from the other kinds of things. And we have heard them explain why there is a distinction. I'd rather get to your side and then you can attack both, or whatever. Your side of it, it seems to me, if I agree to you, I now have to create in the law some kind of thing that sounds very complicated about whether that old bad thing was somehow a pattern or a practice that, as a pattern or a practice, didn't get eradicated within the last few years, or was a totally discrete act, and therefore, had no implication as a pattern or practice that didn't get eradicated. That sounds hard. And the second thing I guess I'd have to do is to create a lot of tolling law because there will be probably a significant number of circumstances where a woman is being paid less, and all she does is for the last six months get her paychecks and she doesn't really know it because pay is a complicated thing, and through no fault of her own, it takes about eight or nine months or even a year for her to find out. And we are going to have to toll, aren't we? So I have, legally speaking, a complicated tolling system that I have to graft on to this, your case. I also have to start distinguishing Bazemore which is pretty hard to do. But on the other side, they are just saying, go with the flow. Nobody is really hurt, because the employer has to worry about all this stuff anyway under the Equal Pay Act. I'm giving you that summary so you can just shoot it down.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it was a compound question, but I'll try to answer each of its parts. The first point I would make is that Bazemore came after Evans and Hazelwood and Ricks, and it did not distinguish Evans or Hazelwood or Ricks on the grounds that Bazemore is a pay case and Hazelwood and Evans were not pay cases. It distinguished them on the grounds of whether or not the alleged discrimination was taking place in the charge filing period. So this notion that Bazemore stands as a proposition that Evans and Lorance and that line of cases doesn't apply because they don't apply to pay cases was not the opinion of the Court in Bazemore. Secondly, we are not asking you, and I don't think it takes any difficulty to apply the rule that we are proposing in this case. We are proposing the same rule that's set forth in Justice Stevens' opinion for the Court in Evans, the same rule that's set forth in Justice Powell's opinion in Ricks, the same rule that's set forward in Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court in Lorance.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there is a slight difference in that you're focused on whether discrimination occurred within the 180-day period. And if I understand you correctly, discrimination would have occurred during the 180-day period if the employer knew of the policy that I described, because then he would be knowingly paying less.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. Not if he had knowledge of --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought your answer to Justice Alito made that point.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what I said to Justice Alito was, if the employer knew that it previously had a policy and if it knew and intended that its present pay would be done for gender-related reasons or racially-related reasons, it would constitute --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the question of whether just knowing that that's a source of the policy would be a gender-related reason.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the question is whether there was a present policy. That's the point the Solicitor General makes in its brief and the point we make in our brief.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, in my hypothetical there was a policy established 20 years ago, a 20 percent differential, never been changed. And the only question that would differ, in some cases the employer knows about it and in some others he doesn't.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if the employer is presently applying, and knowingly and intentionally doing so, a 20 percent differential for male and female employees for no reason other than the gender of the employees, that's a present violation.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what his reason is, this is always the way we did it. That's his reason.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if what he's saying is, the way we have always done it is engage in gender discrimination, then doing it in the present time period would state a present claim.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But suppose he has no intent to discriminate as a present matter, but he also knows that his decision is necessarily based on a policy that was discriminatory some years ago. What result?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think if I understood the question, Justice Kennedy, I think no present claim, because the only thing you said that he knew is that they previously engaged in discriminatory actions.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He knows it, but his present decision is necessarily based on some prior decision that was discriminatory.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That in and of itself is not sufficient. That's the point that, the seniority system in Lorance was necessarily based upon an earlier decision that the employer --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How is that -- how is that consistent with the statement in Bazemore that the employer has a duty to eradicate past discrimination?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the duty was to eradicate the alleged ongoing facially discriminatory pay practices that preceded the enactment of Title VII and were alleged to have been maintained for racially purposeful reasons after Title VII became effective to a public employer. There is no contemplation in that case that that duty would require an employer to investigate discrete employment decisions made in years gone by that weren't made the subject of a timely charge. What this Court has said repeatedly is when the charge filing period passes and no charge is brought, the employer is entitled to treat that past act as if it was a lawful act. That's what Justice Thomas' opinion in Morgan says. That's what, the opinion that Justice Stevens wrote for the Court in Evans.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that so even if they know it was in fact originally an unlawful act?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You draw a line between present purposeful discrimination and present knowledge of past discrimination which is knowingly carried forward.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. Because the purpose of Section 706(e) is to give repose for those past decisions.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How do you describe dealing with a case like Manhart where they were complaining about a pension plan that had been instituted, oh, way longer than 180 days, years and years before?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That plan was facially discriminatory. It included on the face of the plan gender-based mortality tables. And as Justice Scalia's opinion for the Court in Lorance and the footnote that Justice Souter pointed out to, a facially discriminatory policy necessarily evidences present intent each time it is applied, and that is the important distinction. On the one hand you have cases that are both timely and as a matter of law show present intent because they are facially discriminatory. On the other end of the continuum you have cases that are only about past discrimination and do not involve any present actionable claim of intentional discrimination, and they are both untimely and legally insufficient. And then you have the cases in the middle which concern present allegations of discriminatory practices so obnoxious, as alleged in Bazemore, that the Court held that district court may have been clearly erroneous in its conclusion that there was no present intentional discrimination.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Nager. Mr. Gornstein?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34268 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Title VII gives employees like petitioner 180 days to challenge an individual pay decision such as a denial of a pay raise. Employees who allow the 180-day period to pass may not years later and even at the end of their careers challenge their current paychecks on the grounds that they are the result of a number of discrete individually discriminatory pay decisions that occurred long ago.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This would be a good Equal Pay Act case, wouldn't it?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. NAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If it met the requirements of the Equal Pay Act, which is that it has to be the same knowledge, skills and responsibilities and effort for the job, then every time that you have a failure to deliver equal pay for equal work there is a violation of the act. But Title VII is not an equal pay for equal work statute, it is a nondiscrimination statute, and so that you have to show intentional discrimination in pay, not just the absence of equal pay.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why doesn't it become intentional, at least after 1995, when the supervisor recognizes that he's got an employee that is out of the appropriate range for her job, whether she does it badly or well?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, if an employee brought a claim within 180 days of the decision made then, that is to not, to not equalize the pay further --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why would she bring it then? They gave her a big raise that year.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, because I think what you're suggesting is they didn't give her a big enough raise, because there was still intentional discrimination from prior years that were not, that were unchallenged.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Didn't she have every reason to expect, well, they finally noticed it, so next year I'm going to get that same size raise, but that it doesn't happen the next year?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if it doesn't happen that next year, then that employee has 180 days to challenge that pay decision on the ground that it's intentionally discriminatory. If she does not do that, she cannot come back 15 years later and say that a decision that was made 15 years ago and 14 years ago were based on my gender, and they --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ She is not talking about a decision made 15 or 14 in this case. She starts out even, and it builds up over time.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think in some, in some cases that, pay cases, it will build up over time. In some cases it will happen immediately. But in either case, what Title VII says is that you have 180 days to challenge a discrete pay decision. If you do not do that, you cannot come back later, years later, four years later, six years later, or here at the end of her career, and challenge every pay decision that's been made up until then on the grounds that intent, it was intentionally discriminatory and continues to have ongoing effects.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you could if the person making the decision was aware of the discriminatory policy.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Knowledge of prior unlawful acts is relevant evidence in deciding whether it's present day intentional discrimination. But just as in a case where there's a promotion and I'm aware that there was a prior discrimination in a promotion and that was not timely challenged, and the person comes to me today and says I want my promotion now. If I'm aware that she was denied that promotion for discriminatory reason but she did not timely challenge it, my decision not to give her that promotion is not automatically discriminatory.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you're changing the hypothetical. My hypothetical was simply a pay case.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understand that, and I'm saying the same rule applies in a pay case that applies in a promotion case.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're saying, I think contrary to your colleague if I remember correctly, that even if the employer knew of the 20 percent differential policy established 20 years ago, it could still carry it into effect today.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What I'm saying with respect to a policy is if you have an ongoing policy that is still being applied in the limitations period, and that your current policy is to pay less to women than to men, then of course you can sue.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let's say it's the same person who made the decision. You know, five years ago he said I'm giving a 6 percent raise to men, I'm giving a 3 percent raise to women, and then he decides that's illegal, and so from now on everybody is going to get a 4 percent raise every year if you meet certain standards. Is that ongoing discrimination or is that a neutral thing, that he doesn't have to take into account the past discrimination?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a neutral discrete act that was made at the time. It was not challenged.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Even though he knows that it carries forward the illegal discrimination?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Even when the employer -- you can have an inference from knowledge of past illegal conduct that your present intent is to carry forward that differential based on the person's sex, but it is not an automatic inference. You can also, the employer could say look, that was a decision that occurred a while ago. A lot of people did this. There were decisions made that affected a lot of other people --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you're talking about --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and I didn't correct those either, and that's a neutral policy.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that's a defense. And you're talking about, yes, you might draw that inference but that inference would be wrong because I have a defense. The defense is poor performance explains it, not sex discrimination.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But under Title VII, poor performance isn't a defense. It is negating intentional discrimination. It's the employer's employee's burden --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought at least in this area, the defenses were the same as under the Equal Pay Act.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there are -- there is an additional layer of defense, but still the employee has to prove an additional element in a Title VII claim, not just the absence of equal pay for equal work, it has to --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Gornstein, why should we listen to the Solicitor General rather than the EEOC? I mean, they have taken a different position from the one that you're urging upon us.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The EEOC has taken a different position but that decision that the EEOC has taken has been based on its reading of this Court's decision in Bazemore, and this Court does not give deference to the EEOC under Skidmore or under any other standard.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So why don't we at least hear from the EEOC? That has happened in other cases where the Department of Justice and the EEOC take different positions, at least the EEOC filed a brief even though it wasn't the Government's brief.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That has occasionally happened in the past. It has not happened as a regular matter, or to my knowledge it does not ordinarily occur. The EEOC --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the EEOC is upheld in the Court of Appeals and review is sought here, will the Government confess error?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34300 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry, Justice Souter?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34301 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the EEOC decision is upheld by one of the Courts of Appeals and there is an attempt to bring the case here on cert, will the Government confess error?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the Court rules in the Government's favor in this case, then that case would have to be vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light of this Court's decision today. The EEOC's --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm asking a simpler question. Let's assume that somehow we fudge it. If -- if there is a clear cut case in which the EEOC takes a position different from the one the Government is now espousing, and a Court of Appeals upholds it, and cert is sought here, will the Solicitor General say please remand, or simply confess judgment?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, I would like to answer that question today but of course if the Court doesn't resolve the question today that's been decided today, but issues a new decision, anything we would have to do would have to look at that new decision and make a judgment about what the law is at that time. And so my -- my point is --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think I got your point.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Touche.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To go on, there are three decisions of this Court that control the result here, Evans, Ricks and Lorance, each of which says that the employee cannot circumvent the limitations period by challenging conduct within the limitations period on the grounds that it is the result of a prior act of intentional discrimination that was not timely challenged. A second reason to reject petitioner's rule is that petitioner's rule, as petitioner admits, creates a special rule for pay cases when there is nothing in the language of Title VII that would justify a special rule. Title VII has the same mandate of nondiscrimination for pay as for any other practice. It has the same 180-day period for pay claims as any other claim. And the third reason to reject petitioner's view is that it would undo the statute of limitations in pay cases, because the result would be, what you have here is that an employee could wait until the end of their career, or at least a very substantial number of years, and then challenge current pay on the basis of past acts that took place a long time ago. And Justice Breyer, you talked about it being limited to just back pay during the two-year period. The courts that have looked at this have not decided whether it's the 180-day period or the two-year period if you buy petitioner's theory, I don't think he has either. But the important additional point of order is you're still hinging liability on past acts long ago and you're adding the possibility of compensatory relief and punitive damages, so it's not the limited damage award that you're contemplating necessarily.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What would you do on the other side of this? It if you win on this, then don't you have to have a fairly relaxed standard of allowing the woman, tolling or something, when she just gets some paychecks that would take her a while to figure out that these are really reflecting some old discrimination and she doesn't know. It's different in that respect from the promotion itself.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well in some -- if she's denied a pay raise and she's aware that other people are getting substantial pay raises -- I don't think it's that much different than somebody else getting the promotion and me not getting that promotion.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, she knows this. She knows that, all these boxes on her paychecks and she's not quite sure what they mean. All right, your answer is not much different.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GORNSTEIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, to the extent that you want to address equitable tolling. That's the question, should there be equitable tolling until such time as she's aware of the disparity. But what petitioner's theory does is says even after the employee is aware of the disparity she can wait 15 more years and then sue.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Russell, you have 3 minutes remaining.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34314 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think the fundamental disagreement in this case comes down to what is the unlawful employment practice Congress was referring to when it prohibited discrimination with respect to compensation. If it is under our view, in our view, the payment of an intentionally disparate wage, then there's no question that under Bazemore the violation occurred during the limitations period. The fact that the intent was formed outside the limitations period doesn't make the present payment of a disparate wage because of sex any less intentionally discriminatory. But the difference in the conceptions, which frankly isn't answered by the plain text of this statute itself, should be resolved in light of the practical consequences of the differences in the rules. The Solicitor General acknowledges that a paycheck accrual rule applies at least in a case of a policy of discrimination, but that's a very difficult rule to administer for the EEOC, which must make a determination of timeliness before it even has authority to investigate a claim. It shouldn't be left to the EEOC to figure out whether there's an unwritten practice or an unwritten policy which would require an extensive investigation not only of the petitioner's pay but of everybody else's. You recall that in Bazemore they had to conduct a multiple regression analysis to establish a pattern of discrimination there. Our rule is simple to administer and has been administered for decades in the lower courts and it's the rule that the EEOC itself has chosen in construing this ambiguous aspect of the statute.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you agree that their action is just based on Bazemore or their reading of Bazemore?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, that's incorrect. I mean, the EEOC has taken this position that you can challenge present pay disparities even before the Court's decision in Bazemore and it continued to adhere to it afterward. The fact that they cited to Bazemore shouldn't disentitle them to the kind of deference that they're ordinarily entitled to when they construe a statute that's given to them, and this is precisely the kind of question Congress would have entitled them to exercise their expertise on. Finally, I would like to raise the point that under respondent's rule the Extension Service would have been permitted to pay blacks less than white in perpetuity in Bazemore so long as it did so because of cost and not because it wanted to continue to discriminate on the basis of race. And similarly, under the Solicitor General's view an employer who had intentionally discriminated through discrete decisions against some of its employees prior to the act would be allowed to continue to do so after the act because the decision would have been the potentially unlawful act in that case and that wouldn't have been actionable. We respectfully suggest that Congress intended nothing than a complete --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How could cost justify a dual pay scale?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It could -- the Extension Service --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You'd have to have another factor in the decision, which was that you didn't want to change pay. But cost alone couldn't justify that.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would be a nondiscriminatory reason. They would -- they would say that, the reason we didn't immediately equalize salaries is because it cost too much, it would have required -- we'd be required to cut down on our programs. And under respondent's view that is not intentionally pay-maintaining discrimination.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, you'd have to say, we don't want to spend any more and we also don't want to equalize pay. You have to say the second too.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They would say, we don't want to equalize pay because it costs too much, and that's not a discriminatory reason for maintaining the prior disparity. But ultimately --
05-1074 +++$+++ 34323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you say you're not going to equalize pay, you're saying you're going to discriminate on the basis of race.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which is what happened here. Goodyear continued to discriminate on the basis of sex, knowing as a matter of agency law that it had done, it had set her pay for discriminatory reasons in the past.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You can equalize pay by lowering others. You don't -- raising the discriminated-against class is not the only way to equalize pay. So I don't see how cost is a justification for continuing the disparity.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not under the Equal Pay Act. You can only equalize up, not down.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under Title VII you can equalize either way, right?
05-1074 +++$+++ 34329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would, but if they chose not to equalize at all because they don't want to spend the money the money that would be a nondiscriminatory reason.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You'd certainly have a very happy work force if you equalized one way.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RUSSELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you.
05-1074 +++$+++ 34332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34336 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument first today in 05-1120, Massachusetts versus Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Milkey.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34338 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I may, I'd like to frame the merits very quickly and then turn immediately to standing. Although the case before you arises in an important policy area, it turns on ordinary principles of statutory interpretation and administrative law. EPA made a decision based on two grounds, both of which constitute plain errors of law reviewable under any standard. EPA's principle grounds was that it lacked authority over the emissions of the four substances at issue, even if they, in fact, endanger public health and welfare. That legal conclusion fails as a matter of law. As a fallback position, EPA declined to consider if these substances are endangering public health and welfare, claiming its policy approach made more sense than the regulatory scheme encompassed in section 1202 of the Clean Air Act. Although EPA possesses a good deal of discretion in applying the statutory endangerment test, it cannot rest its ruling on impermissible grounds as it did here. We are not asking the Court to pass judgment on the science of climate change or to order EPA to set emission standards. We simply want EPA to visit the rulemaking petition based upon permissible considerations. And now, Your Honor, I'd like to turn to standing. Petitioner showed a wide variety of injury in fact, all of which are the kinds of harms the statute was aimed at preventing. For example, our uncontested affidavits establish that as a matter of physics, the more greenhouse gases accumulate in the air, the more temperatures are going to rise, ocean waters expand, and the seas rise. And of course as the seas expand, they rise everywhere around the world. Some areas such as Massachusetts will be hit particularly hard because we're also subject to a land subsidence, but that --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought that the standing requires imminent harm. If you haven't been harmed already, you have to show the harm is imminent. Is this harm imminent?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is, Your Honor. We have shown that the sea levels are already occurring from the current amounts of greenhouse gases in the air, and that means it is only going to get worse as the --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ When? I mean, when is the predicted cataclysm?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34342 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, it's not so much a cataclysm as ongoing harm. The harm does not suddenly spring up in the year 2100, it plays out continuously over time. And even to the extent you focus on harms that occur in the future, there's nothing conjectural about that. Once these gases are emitted into the area, and they stay a long time, the laws of physics take over.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34343 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there's a lot of conjecture about whether -- I gather that there's something of a consensus on warming, but not a consensus on how much of that is attributable to human activity. And I gather that -- what is it? Something like seven percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions are attributable to automobiles in the United States?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34344 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's actually about 6 percent, Your Honor.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34345 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 6 percent? Thank you.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's important to point out as well, though, that in the ruling we challenge, EPA has disavowed authority over all U.S. sources of emissions, which constitute about 20 percent of global --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but that doesn't go to the harm that you're claiming. I mean, we're talking about the, you know, the standing issue right now. And if you've been harmed, you've claimed harm because of carbon dioxide emissions, right?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Agreed, Your Honor. But my point was that they disclaimed authority over all sources of carbon --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand, but that has nothing to do with whether you have standing. That has to do with the merits of the case. But on the standing point, only new cars would be affected, right? So even the reduction of the 6 percent would take a few years, wouldn't it?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would take a few years, Your Honor, but it is a basic premise of the Clean Air Act that vehicle fleets regularly turn over --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand. But it goes to how imminent the harm is and how remediable the imminent harm is. If, in fact, the 6 percent will only be reduced to maybe five and a half in the next few years, your --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, we have shown in the record that a 40 percent reduction in carbon dioxide from cars is currently feasible. And since those emissions account for --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not in the first year.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. We agree, Your Honor.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean ultimately, when all the cars currently on the roads are off and the new cars with, you know, whatever measures you think will reduce the carbon dioxide are on the road, then 40 percent would be the figure.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But whatever position holds for motor vehicles would similarly hold for power plants, and has there been any application to EPA with respect to carbon dioxide in power plants?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There has, Your Honor. In fact, EPA has turned down a rulemaking petition to regulate them under the new source performance standard section of the Clean Air Act, and that is currently on appeal in the D.C. Circuit, but it is currently stayed pending the outcome of this case, and it just --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you get the benefit of that broader allegation in establishing your standard? In other words, if you've challenged EPA's refusal to apply a particular level of greenhouse regulation to a particular model of car, can you say, well, they're following the same approach to a coal powered -- coal fueled power plant, and so we get to establish a broader injury? Or, aren't you limited to the specific legal challenge you're raising here?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I think it's actually more direct in the sense that in the decision we challenge here, they said greenhouse gases are not air pollutants under any regulatory provision of the act. So at least on --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Don't you have to show injury from their decision here? The fact that other people, or you presumably as well might be injured by their decisions that you are not challenging here, that doesn't help your standing here, does it?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe it does, Your Honor, because we cannot win that other case unless we win this case here in terms of the authority question. And in any event, it is important to point out that because of the scale of the problem, relatively small percentage deductions in global emissions can lead to real world results.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But at the outset, you made this, some of this perhaps reassuring statement that we need not decide about global warming in this case. But don't we have to do that in order to decide the standing argument, because there's no injury if there's not global warming? Or, can you show standing simply because there is a likelihood that the perceived would show that there's an injury?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, especially in this case where none of our affidavits were challenged, I don't think the Court needs to go there ultimately on the merits because we showed through our uncontested affidavits that these harms will occur. There was no evidence put in to the contrary, and I would add that the reports on which EPA itself relies conclude that climate change is occurring in --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Those affidavits talked about the fact that if the government starts to regulate, the technology is going to change, if the technology changes, other governments will adopt it, and all that, and that strikes me as sort of spitting out conjecture on conjecture, the sort that we disapproved of.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, although we believe we have shown other governments will follow suit, we are not in any sense relying on that. We can easily show our standing without relying on that. And that's because --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Same argument if the automobile emissions were 1 percent contributors?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would be the same argument. And I would add that EPA in other contexts has determined on several occasions that a 1 percent contribution is significant under the Clean Air Act.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How is that consistent with our taxpayer standing cases where the argument is that a taxpayer doesn't have standing to challenge an illegal expenditure as a general matter simply because his contribution, the benefit that he's claiming is so small and so widely dispersed?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, it is different because here there is particularized injury that we have shown. The injury doesn't get any more particular than states losing 200 miles of coastline, both sovereign territory and property we actually own, to rising seas.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you look ahead, I don't know how far imminence allows you to look ahead, but let's say we're looking at 5 years or 10 years, what particularized harm does the record show that Massachusetts will, or faces an imminent threat of suffering, that can be traceable to the reductions that you want to produce through these regulations?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, if I can deal with the traceability part of that question first, traceability is easy to show here because the extent of our harm is caused by the overall amount of the gases in the air. And being focused on the 20 percent of all U.S. sources, or the 6 percent of the cars, that's still a sizeable portion of the problem, so we know that 6 or 20 percent is there. In terms of the particular harms, similarly we have shown --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 6 percent is the total emissions, the total contribution from motor vehicles in the United States, right?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34374 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To the global carbon dioxide emission.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34375 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ To the global. And so, the reduction that you could achieve under the best of circumstances with these regulations would be a small portion of that, would it not?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34376 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would be, we have shown in the record it would be about a two-and-a-half percent over the time it takes to turn the fleet over. But it's important that given the nature of the harms, even small reductions can be significant. For example, if we're able to save only a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars that Massachusetts parks agencies are projected to lose, that reduction is itself significant.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That assumes everything else is going to remain constant, though, right? It assumes there isn't going to be a greater contribution of greenhouse gases from economic development in China and other places that's going to displace whatever marginal benefit you get here.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. But reducing domestic emissions will reduce our harm, the harm we would otherwise face regardless of what --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not if your harm is the alleged loss of coastline. Not necessarily. It depends upon what happens across the globe with respect to greenhouse emissions.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, we would still lose coastline but we would not lose as much because these harms are cumulative, and while reducing U.S. emissions will not eliminate all the harm we face, it can reduce the harm that these emissions are causing. So it will necessarily reduce our harm and satisfy redressibility.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, do we know that that's a straight line ratio, that a reduction of two-and-a-half percent of carbon dioxide -- well, two and a half overall would save two-and-a-half percent of your coastline? Is that how it works? I'm not a scientist, but I'd be surprised if it was so rigid.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't believe it's established it's necessarily a straight line. But I want to emphasize that small vertical rises cause a large loss of horizontal land. For example, where the slope is less than 2 percent, which is true of much of the Massachusetts coastline, every foot rise will create a loss of more than 50 feet of horizontal land. And for example, in the State of New York, the Oppenheimer affidavit projects that New York could well lose thousands of acres of its sovereign territory by the year 2020. So the harm is already occurring. It is ongoing and it will happen well into the future.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What's your strongest case from this Court to support your standing allegation?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, what I would say to that is our standing here is so much more direct and particularized than, for example, the harm this Court found sufficient in Laidlaw, which was --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Laidlaw was a specific citizen suit provision, wasn't it?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was, Your Honor.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So doesn't that make it somewhat analytically distinct from this case?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't believe so, Your Honor. Here I think the fact that the States are showing harm not only to them in a property sense, but in their sovereign capacity --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What's your authority for that? I have the same question as the Chief Justice. I was looking at your brief for the strongest case. Suppose there were a big landowner that owned lots of coastline. Would he have the same standing that you do or do you have some special standing as a State, and if so what is the case which would demonstrate that?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, first of all, we agree that a large landowner would himself or herself have --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What of a small landowner?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. I'm asking whether you have some special standing --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- as a State and, if so, what's the authority for that?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34395 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, first of all, I do think we have special standing. For example, here it's uncontested that greenhouse gases are going to make ozone problems worse, which makes it harder for us to comply with our existing Clean Air Act responsibilities. And the -- in the West Virginia case, which is a D.C. Circuit case, the Court found that that itself provided an independent source of standing. In terms of Supreme Court cases, the -- it's been -- for 200 years, this Court has recognized loss of state sovereign property as a traditional --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34396 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't know. 1907 was Georgia versus Tennessee Copper, and that was pre-Massachusetts versus Mellon. That seems to me your best case. What about a small landowner? I asked the question about a big landowner. Suppose you have a small landowner and he owned a lot?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34397 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I think if someone is losing property because of this problem, then that person would have standing, but we're nowhere near a de minimis threshold here. We have shown we own property, 200 miles of coastline which we're losing, and we think the standing is straightforward.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I'm not sure -- I think our opinions have even said it, but certainly commentators have often said it, that really the far margin of our standing cases has been, you know, the famous scrap case, in which the allegation was that the added pollution from municipal incineration of municipal waste which would -- which couldn't be transported by rail for burial because the ICC rates were too high, that added pollution interfered with the students' -- they were Georgetown Law students -- their hiking in the George Washington Forest along the Blue Ridge. That seems to me a much more immediate kind of damage; yet that's been referred to as really the far margin of our standing cases. You're talking not about their being affected by ambient air but being affected by a stratospheric effect which then has another consequence that you allege.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, once these are emitted the laws of physics take over, so our harm is imminent in the sense that lighting a fuse on a bomb is imminent harm. It may take --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Milkey, does it make a difference that you're not representing a group of law students, but a number of States who are claiming that they are disarmed from regulating and that the regulatory responsibility has been given to the Federal Government and the Federal Government isn't exercising it? I thought you had a discrete claim based on the sovereignty of States and their inability to regulate dependent on the law Congress passed that gives that authority to the EPA. I thought that was --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, you are correct that we are saying that provides us also an independent source of our standing.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't understand that. You have standing whenever a Federal law preempts State action? You can complain about the implementation of that law because it has preempted your State action? Is that the basis of standing you're alleging?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In short, Your Honor --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you know any case that has ever held that?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I would cite you to the amicus brief of the State of Arizona et al., which cites several cases, albeit not in this Court, that stand for that principle. Your Honor, if I may turn to the merits quickly, section 202(a)(1) provides EPA jurisdiction over any air pollutant that motor vehicles emit. It's not restricted to certain types of air pollutants or to air pollutants that cause certain kinds of harm. And not only does the act define air pollutant with comprehensive breadth, but we know these four substances are air pollutants from other evidence. For example, Congress itself expressly referred to carbon dioxide as an air pollutant in section 103(g). And since by definition all air pollutants are air pollution agents, we know that Congress understood carbon dioxide to be an agent of air pollution. And if air pollution --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Moving from your authority argument to the exercise of authority, the clause 202(a)(1) requires EPA to prescribe standards which in their judgment cause or contribute to air pollution reasonably anticipated to endanger public health. And they say they haven't made that judgment yet, so they're not in violation of that statutory command.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct, Your Honor; but they have said that they have put off making a judgment based on impermissible grounds. While EPA's explanation is difficult even to follow, one overarching point shines through and that is the agency does not agree with taking a regulatory approach regardless of how it might otherwise come out.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let's say the first day this law is passed, there are a lot of air pollutants that come out of motor vehicles. I mean, is EPA immediately in violation of this statute if they don't issue emissions regulations for every one those air pollutants on day one?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. EPA has a lot of room to move based both on the endangerment standard itself and on background principles of administrative law.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And presumably the principle that they want to deal with what they regard as the more serious threats sooner. They want to deal with lead first and then they want to deal with other stuff. I mean, what is the -- when did they -- I guess -- move into an abuse of discretion in not exercising a judgment with respect to a particular pollutant?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The answer to that, Your Honor, is that when they do not rely on any of those grounds, they do not rely on lack of information, they did not rely on background principles of administrative law. What though said here is -- and -- that they did not, in fact, contest the seriousness of the problem. But note, in two back to back sentences on page A-82 of the third petition they say: We must address the, issue but we disagree with the regulatory approach. The very section in which they explained why they weren't going to regulate is entitled "Different Policy Approach." Rejecting mandatory motor vehicle regulation as a bad idea is simply not a policy choice that Congress left to EPA.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if you are right and then it went back and the EPA then said, well, an obvious reason also is constraint on our own resources, we have the authority to say what comes first, Congress -- we couldn't possibly do everything that Congress has authorized us to do; so it's our decision, even though we have the authority to do this, we think that we should spend our resources on other things. Suppose they said that? You said they didn't say it this time around, but how far will you get if all that's going to happen is it goes back and then EPA says our resources are constrained and we're not going to spend the money?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, while background administrative law principles provide EPA at least some room to move, we think it's important that EPA say that. If they -- it's a very different opinion if they say, we are not going to regular here because we just don't want to spend the resources on this problem and we want to look elsewhere. If they want to say that, they can say that and then, if at all, there'd be a narrow arbitrary and capricious challenge on that. But the point is here they relied on the impermissible consideration that they simply disagreed with the policy behind the statute.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's not all they said. I'm looking at A-85 and they said establishing emissions now would require EPA to make scientific and technical judgments without the benefit of studies that are being developed to reduce the uncertainty in the area. That's different than saying they disagree with the regulatory approach.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is and it isn't, Your Honor, because that statement will alleges be true. There will always be scientific uncertainty. Agencies will always have an understandable interest in seeing more information. They never --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's a difference between the scientific status of the harm from lead emissions from vehicles that -- when you have lead in the gasoline, to the status, the status of scientific knowledge with respect to the impact on global warming today? Those are two very different levels of uncertainty.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, when EPA regulated lead back in the ethyl days, as the Court court itself took note, there were huge amounts of uncertainty at that time. And EPA has a lot of discretion in evaluating that, that uncertainty. And if the EPA determined that the level of uncertainty was such that it was not reasonable to anticipate endangerment, that is perfectly appropriate. It would also be appropriate if the agency determined that there was so much uncertainty that they couldn't even form a judgment on that. That would be applying the endangerment statute at the same time it put off. But the point is they did not say any of that. They instead relied on impermissible grounds.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Milkey, I had -- my problem is precisely on the impermissible grounds. To be sure, carbon dioxide is a pollutant, and it can be an air pollutant. If we fill this room with carbon dioxide, it could be an air pollutant that endangers health. But I always thought an air pollutant was something different from a stratospheric pollutant, and your claim here is not that the pollution of what we normally call "air" is endangering health. That isn't, that isn't -- your assertion is that after the pollutant leaves the air and goes up into the stratosphere it is contributing to global warming.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Respectfully, Your Honor, it is not the stratosphere. It's the troposphere.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Troposphere, whatever. I told you before I'm not a scientist. (Laughter.)
05-1120 +++$+++ 34421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's why I don't want to have to deal with global warming, to tell you the truth.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under the express words of the statute -- and this is 302(g) -- for something to be an air pollutant it has to be emitted into the ambient air or otherwise entered there.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, and I agree with that. It is when it comes out an air pollutant. But is it an air pollutant that endangers health? I think it has to endanger health by reason of polluting the air, and this does not endanger health by reason of polluting the air at all.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, respectfully, I disagree, and there is nothing in the act that actually requires the harm to occur in the ambient air. In fact, some of the harm here does occur there.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it talks about air pollution all the time. That's what the, that's what the thing is about, air pollution. It's not about global warming and it's not about the troposphere.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, we are not saying, first of all that global warming is air pollution, any more than we're saying that asthma is air pollution. They're both effects. I would point you to the example of acid rain, where the pollutant there, sulfur dioxide, the problem is it causes its harm after it leaves the air, after it gets washed out. Air pollutants do not need to cause harm in the ambient air. Your Honor, I would add that our interpretation satisfies common sense because, while EPA has plenary authority over substances that motor vehicles emit, those substances are regulated only if EPA determines that they cause endangerment. By defining the term "air pollutant" comprehensively, Congress has not prejudged what may cause endangerment, but it has allowed other pollutants to be regulated as their harms become appreciated. It is EPA's interpretation that fails the common sense test. They have suggested that the term "air pollutant agent" creates an independent test so important that it may prevent some harmful compounds from being regulated without providing any hint of what the term means or how it applies in this case. And they cannot explain any number of anomalies such as the fact that methane is already a regulated air pollutant, yet they claim they can't look at its climate effects. Your Honor, if there are no more questions I'd like to reserve my time.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Milkey. Mr. Garre.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34429 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you. Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. After carefully considering the issue the nation's expert agency in environmental matters concluded that Congress has not authorized it to embark on the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to address global climate change. And that even if it has, now is not the time to exercise such authority, in light of the substantial scientific uncertainty surrounding global climate change and the ongoing studies designed to address those uncertainties. Plaintiffs have provide no reason to override that quintessential administrative judgment.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34430 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Garre, doesn't the EPA's decision on the first, "we don't have any authority," doesn't that infect its subsequent decision, "well, even if we did, we wouldn't exercise it." But they've already decided they don't have authority.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't think that it does. In the sense, I think EPA made clear in its decisional document that it considered as an alternative matter, that if it, even assuming it did have the authority, that it wouldn't be appropriate to exercise it at this time. And importantly, too, I mean, just to be clear on this, EPA has never made an endangerment finding with respect to global climate change. That was true in 1998 and 1999 when the agency had a different position on authority to regulate. Even then the agency's position was clear. Even assuming we have the authority, now is not the time to exercise it. So I don't think --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- I take it that on that question, is there authority, the EPA has come out one way, but at least it is debatable because as you just said, the predecessors of the current people said we do have the authority.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, to that degree, Your Honor, this Court has made clear, for example, in the Brand X case that even where agencies change positions, where they've provided reasonable grounds for a new interpretation, that interpretation is entitled to Chevron deference. We think that that is true in this case.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ On this particular issue, the opinion as I read it, of the EPA, consists of 32 pages. Twenty of those pages, 22 in fact, deal with whether they have statutory authority. And of the 10 that deal with the issue we're talking about now, five of them give as their reason that they think that the President has a different policy. Of the remaining five, two more consider international aspects of the problem and how you have to get other countries to cooperate; and then the conclusion of that part says in light of these considerations, we decide not to exercise our power. Now their claim with respect to that, is that at least three of the four considerations are not proper things for the agency to take into account: namely whether the President wants to do something different, whether we're running foreign policy properly, whether cooperation with other countries are relevant to this particular issue. So what they've asked us to do is send it back so they can get the right reasons. Now -- if they want not to do it. What's your response to that?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, I don't think that it depends on how many pages that the agency devoted to the --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The reason it depended on that is whether or not these other, improper considerations might have influenced the ultimate decision not to go ahead.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it depends on the reasons that the agency gave. And one of the reasons that the agency gave was the substantial scientific uncertainty surrounding the issue of global climate change. Petitioners acknowledge that that was an appropriate consideration for the agency. So even if you think the other considerations were inappropriate, and we certainly do not, but even if you think they are, the agency gave an appropriate reason. And that reasons --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ When I write an opinion -- when I write an opinion, sometimes I write the words: "We decide this matter in light of the following three factors taken together." And I guess a lawyer who said, "one of those factors alone the Court has held justified the result all by itself" -- in saying the Court has held that, I guess that wouldn't be so. That would be a bad lawyer, wouldn't it?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But Your Honor --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If they write that all of these considerations justify our result, again, one of them by themselves, it sounds, they think would not have been sufficient.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I don't think that that is a fair reading of the EPA decisional document, Your Honor. Certainly, the agency didn't go out of its way to say, "and reading these considerations together and not any of them individually." And with respect to the scientific uncertainty, Your Honor, you also have to take into account that the EPA had before it and pointed to the report of the National Research Council on global climate change.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I find it interesting that the scientists whose worked on that report said there were a good many omissions that would have indicated that there wasn't nearly the uncertainty that the agency described.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, if you are referring to the amicus brief, Your Honor, there are -- assuming there are amicus briefs on the other side. The Ballunas amicus brief -- I think it is fair for the Court to look at, to look at the document that the agency had before it. That -- that document produced by the National Research -- Research Council, that's the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences. And it's one of the gold standards of research.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But in their selective quotations, they left out parts that indicated there was far less uncertainty than the agency purported to find.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I think one thing that we ought to be able to agree on is there is that there is uncertainty surrounding the phenomenon of global climate change. I think the debate is on which areas are more uncertain than the others. But certainly I think the agency was entitled to conclude, particularly if you take into account the deference this Court should give to that kind of determination, that the scientific uncertainty surrounding the issue of global climate change, surrounding issues of the extent of natural variability in climate, surrounding the issues of impact of climate feedbacks like ocean circulation, and low cloud cover, are permissible considerations for the agency to take into -- --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there uncertainty on the basic proposition that these greenhouse gases contribute to global warming.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, the report says that it is likely that there is a -- a connection, but that it cannot unequivocally be established. I think that -- if I could use that to go back to the standing question, Your Honor, which is the fundamental question of whether they've showed not just a connection between greenhouse gas emissions in toto and the phenomenon of global climate change, but the particular class of greenhouse gas emissions at issue in this case. Six percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, at most. That assumes you put all U.S. vehicles off the road or that they are all zero emission cars. So you're talking about emissions --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- it is not a mathematical question, right? I mean, you would -- it's that you would -- what is the number? What's enough? 10 percent? 15 percent? Presumably, there's more to it than the percentage of emissions attributable to be this particular --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that's true, Your Honor. But what petitioners here to show, they bear the burden in order to establish standing under this case, is that regulation of the class of greenhouse gases at issue in this case will make a difference to them.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose it is not greenhouse gas. Suppose it was Agent Orange. Suppose there a car is coming down the street and it sprays out Agent Orange. And I come into the Court and I say, you know, I think that Agent Orange is going to kill me with cancer. And the reply is, well, we have some scientists here who say your chance of dying of cancer from Agent Orange is only 1 in 30. Maybe 1 in 50. Maybe 1 in a thousand. Maybe 1 in 10,000. And therefore, you have no standing to require the EPA to regulate this pollutant, Agent Orange, which is in a green cloud all over the city. Now, would you say that the person who's made that claim has no standing?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I think that that is a fundamentally different case, for the simple reason that global climate change is a global phenomenon. I mean one --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I was only addressing, using that to -- to address your problem that the chances are too small that, in fact, any one individual will be affected by the 7 percent or 6 percent of the material that comes out of the truck -- the CO2.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the individual in that case, Your Honor, like the plaintiffs here, would have to show specific facts demonstrating injury, redressibility and traceability. Now in this case --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your problem, I think, you take the position, the proposition that the greater the harm the greater the risk, the smaller the probability has to be before it is reasonable to act, and necessary to act.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, this Court's standing cases make clear that you have to show that granting the relief requested is likely to redress the alleged harms. And again, looking at the --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They are saying it is likely to do so, even though we cannot give you a point for point percentage correlation between reduction of gas and coastline loss. You're saying, it seems to me, that they have somehow got to pinpoint this mathematically --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't -- we're not saying that.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- before, before there is redressibility.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We're not saying that, Your Honor. We're saying that they have, they certainly have to do more than they have done here. And they're granted their standing --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Tell me what it is that they need, be more specific about what they need to do.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I will be more specific. And if I could also just point to what they grounded their case on here. They grounded their case on here, in the declarations, on the notion if the United States regulates greenhouse gas emissions of vehicles, then other countries will follow suit with respect to the emissions of vehicles and other greenhouse gas emissions. That's clear from the McCracken declaration on page 239, paragraph 32 of the JA, as well as the Walsh declaration.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it can be argued that the Assistant Attorney General hasn't argued that here.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He has said that 6 percent is enough.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That, that's true, Your Honor, but I still think you have to look at the basis that they've relied upon on standing. And they haven't shown specific facts which should provide any comfort to this Court that regulation of less than 6 percent or fewer greenhouse emissions worldwide will have any effect on their alleged injuries.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is there -- why is there reason to assume that it will have no effect?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That seems to be the assumption you're making. You are saying unless they can pinpoint the correlation between reduction of gas and effect, let's say in coastline loss, they have not shown either causation or a sufficient likelihood of redressibility.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But why do they have to show a precise correlation as opposed simply to establishing what I think is not really contested, that there is a correlation between greenhouse gases and the kind of loss that they're talking about; and it is reasonable to suppose that some reduction in the gases will result in some reduction in future loss. Why is that insufficient?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, one fundamental reason is that we don't know what the rest of the world is going to do, whether or not --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let's assume the rest -- let's assume that the rest of the world does nothing. I don't think that's a very reasonable assumption, but let's make that assumption. So that the only thing we're talking is the 6 percent. If the 6 percent can be reduced -- I think the suggestion was over a reasonable period of time, by two and a half percent of the 6, there is, I suppose, reason to expect that there will be, maybe not two and a half percent less coastline lost, but some degree of less coastline lost because there is a correlation between the gas and the loss of the coastline. Why is that an unreasonable assumption to make in order to show causation and redressibility, bearing in mind that redressibility is a question of more or less, not a question of either/or. They don't have to show that it will stop global warming. Their point is that will reduce the degree of global warming and likely reduce the degree of loss, if it is only by two and a half percent. What's wrong with that?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, their burden is to show that if the Court grants their requested relief it will redress their injuries. I'm not aware --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not redress their injury in the sense that it will prevent any global warming or stop global warming and stop coastal erosion; their argument is a different one. It will reduce the degree of global warming and reduce the degree of coastal loss.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's their argument. Not all or nothing. But a part. That's what they're trying to show.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's fine, Justice Souter, I grant you that. But they still have to show that there is reason that it is likely to believe, that the reduction in that tiny fraction of United States emissions, putting aside the 99 percent or the 95 percent in the rest of the world and what they do, and the evidence that shows that greenhouse gas emissions in those countries are increasing, they have to show the regulation of that tiny fraction would have an affect on their alleged injuries, not to completely redress them, Your Honor. We don't say that --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Don't they have to show that it is reasonable to suppose it will have an effect?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They have to show that it is likely, Your Honor. And they haven't even tried to make that showing. The one thing that they've --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is that showing -- and I agree with, by the way, with the Chief's suggestion a moment ago, life is not, or physics are not so simple as to assume that there's going to be a be a direct two and a half percent reduction of coastline for a two and a half percent reduction from the 6 percent. But isn't it intuitively reasonable to suppose that with some reduction of the greenhouse gases, there will be some reduction of the ensuing damage or the ensuing climate change which causes the damage? Isn't that fair?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think that it is fair, Your Honor. I don't want to pretend to be an expert on global climate change. But the one thing I can say is from the materials I looked at is that this an extraordinarily complex area of science. I'm not aware of any studies available that would suggest that the regulation of that minuscule fraction of greenhouse gas emissions would have any effect whatsoever on the global -- --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But do you have any --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose others cooperate? Suppose, for example, they regulate this and before you know it, they start to sequester carbon with the power plants, and before you know it, they decide ethanol might be a good idea, and before you know it, they decide any one of 15 things, each of which has an impact, and lo and behold, Cape Cod is saved. Now why is it unreasonable? Why is it unreasonable to go to an agency and say now you do your part, which is 6 percent, and now we're going to go to a different agency like NHTSA and we're going to ask them too, and we're going to go to your electricity regulation program, and coal. And there are like not a million things that have to be done, maybe there are only seven. But by the time we get those seven things done, we'll make a big difference. Now what is it in the law that says that somehow a person cannot go to an agency and say we want you to do your part? Would you be up here saying the same thing if we're trying to regulate child pornography, and it turns out that anyone with a computer can get pornography elsewhere? I don't think so.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, what I would point you to is your decision in Lujan versus Defenders of Wildlife, Justice Kennedy's opinion in ASARCO versus Kadish, where the Court made clear that you cannot establish standing based on predictions of the actions of independent actors not before it. That's true about other agencies that aren't here today. That's true about other countries whom this Court does not have jurisdiction over.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So they couldn't have gone in and asked for ozone regulations, because that requires other countries? Or what about dumping heavy metals in the sea, and as the sea gets polluted because of what other countries do, but EPA tried to regulate that. Acid rain they tried to regulate. You're saying there is no standing to ask for any of that.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, first of all, Congress has specifically addressed two of the areas that you mentioned, Your Honor, and we're not saying that categorically --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Just because there's no standing to challenge an agency's decision doesn't mean the agency can't regulate that particular area, right?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's exactly right, Your Honor. That's exactly right.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you are saying if Congress passes a statute and they put the words CO2 right in this statute under ambient air, and they say anybody can go and sue if the EPA doesn't do it, you're saying Congress lacks the constitutional authority to do that, because it's Article III we're talking about?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, we're saying two things. First, every plaintiff has the obligation to establish that he has Article III standing under this Constitution. And secondly, there are members of this Court, for example, Justice Kennedy in his concurring opinion in Defenders of Wildlife, who did suggest that perhaps if Congress specifically addresses an issue, that could inform the standing analysis. For example --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They can't compromise the requirements of Article III.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It cannot, Your Honor. Congress could make findings with respect to causation or other issues that this Court would have to give deference to and seriously consider, but you're right. It would not override the requirements of Article III. And there may be some global phenomenon that create more difficult challenges to establish standing but --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As I understand the government's position, you're not merely questioning standing but you also take the position you do not have the authority to do what the plaintiff asks you to do; is that correct?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's true, Your Honor, moving to the merits, that's true. And with respect to that, the agency engaged in the same type of analysis that this Court laid out in the Brown and Williamson case.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you on that question, if we turn to the statute, to Section 201, there's reference to "shall regulate" if in the judgment of the administrator there is a for real danger and so forth. In your view, is there a duty to make a judgment?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, our view is that agencies have inherent discretion to determine when to make that judgment.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could they have a discretion never to make the judgment?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that gets to the question of whether there is, what judicial review is available. We have assumed in this case that there's some measure of judicial review. So I think at some point you got to the point where the agency either has provided no reasons whatsoever, or there is no sound basis for the agency not to take that step. Then assuming that there is a role for the courts here, a court could come in and say that that was inappropriate.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But as I read your brief, you didn't really confront the question, s I understand it, of whether or not there was a duty to make a judgment at all. And I'm interested in what your position on that is.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, again, I think it goes to the question -- we think the statute does not put a deadline on when the agency has to have, and that therefore --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To me, just reading the text of the statute is a little ambiguous. I'm not entirely clear, but it seems to me that just reading that statute, I got the impression that Congress thought that the administrator had a duty to make a judgment when there was enough evidence out there that people were concerned about it and so forth, that there would be a duty there, but you think not?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not the agency's interpretation. In fact in its decisional document under the section no mandatory duty, the agency explains why that's not its interpretation and we think that that's a reasonable interpretation. Congress knows how to constrain the exercise of discretion. We point in footnotes 18 and 19 of our brief of many examples where Congress has laid out deadlines or other constraints on the exercise of discretion, and those aren't present in Section 203.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you would agree that if they did make a judgment, then you would have authority to regulate?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34504 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. And then I think it's a point the D.C. Circuit made in the Ethyl Corporation case at footnote 37, that precisely because the statute imposes a duty to act once that endangerment finding is made, the agency has discretion to determine when to make the endangerment finding.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34505 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In Norton versus Utah Wilderness Alliance, having to do with the regulation of off-road vehicles, we indicated that one measure was whether or not the agency has unreasonably delayed its action.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a separate sort of action, Your Honor. There are cases where people have said that this is unreasonable delay. That's not the claim that the petitioners in this case brought.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me understand your answer to Justice Stevens' question. If EPA made the judgment under the statute, you think they would have had the authority?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Under the statute --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought you had a Brown and Williamson argument that EPA was precluded.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I was assuming -- in answering Justice Stevens' questions, that we were down in the exercise of discretion part. But you're right, Your Honor, the threshold position of the agency on this is that it lacks the authority to --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34511 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I ask about that? I found persuasive Solicitor General Garre's point that in the acid rain context, it isn't air pollution that harms health, but rather it is the effect of the pollutant after it leaves the air and produces the acid rain. Is there anything wrong with that response? It seems to me --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think there is, Your Honor. The way that the agency looked at this is to look at the question of whether Congress intended it to regulate greenhouse gas emissions to address global climate change, and it looked to the factors that this Court laid out in Brown and Williamson. The statute as a whole is specific legislation addressing global climate change, and it concluded that the agency had not authorized it to embark on that regulatory --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You concede that it's an air pollutant that affects health?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. The agency -- what the agency found, Your Honor, was that because global climate change is not air pollution within the meaning of the statute -- which is to say that Congress did not authorize it to regulate it as air pollution.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then why isn't it air pollution within the meaning of the statute, although whatever it is that causes acid rain is?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think, Your Honor, that the key to the agency was that Congress did not give it regulatory authority over this. And I think on the question of whether or not greenhouse gas emissions qualify --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you can't give me any text in this statute itself. It isn't the phrase "air pollution" or any other phrase?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The agency pointed to the term "air pollution agent" in the statute, and concluded that because global climate change was not air pollution that Congress intended to address --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that gets us back to acid rain.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And with respect to acid rain, it's a good example insofar as Congress has enacted a whole separate title of the Clean Air Act to address acid rain. The other thing I want to mention on the interpretive question is, in the Brown and Williamson case, this Court assumed at the outset of its analysis that nicotine would be within the general terms of the definition of drug in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and that cigarettes would fall within the general term of drug --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So that's the position you're taking, that it is within the general term?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it's largely the position that the agency took, Your Honor, insofar as it reasoned that, look, we've looked at everything. We conclude that Congress doesn't intend us to regulate global climate change as air pollution. And so therefore, we're not going to say that greenhouse gases are air pollution agents.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which is why there's a significant difference between the agency saying that for 60 years, and I think this Court stressed that in its opinion, and Congress reacting to that, what the agency's position was. And here where it's a newly minted position, because the agency's position not too long ago was that they did have the authority.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, it was 30 years before the agency reached the conclusion in 1998 that carbon dioxide was an air pollutant. And again, even when it reached that conclusion, it made clear that it didn't think that the agency would exercise its authority to regulate it.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a different question. I'm just focusing on, did it have authority to deal with this issue?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I think -- I mean, I grant you that there are differences between Brown and Williamson and this case, but the fundamental conclusion that the agency reached is the same. Which was, to borrow the phrase from the Whitman case, Congress did not intend to hide elephants in mouse holes. Here we are talking about an issue of the magnitude of regulating global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which are fundamentally an important part of the nation's economy. Nearly 85 percent of the economy is a direct or indirect source of greenhouse gas emissions. And when we look at when Congress did mention carbon dioxide in the statute, which is in the 1990 amendments, Section 103(g), that was the first time that Congress mentioned CO2. And when it did that, it went out of its way to say that it was giving non-regulatory authority to the agency, and moreover, that nothing in this section shall provide any basis for any air pollution control requirements. That's a strange thing for Congress to say if it believed that the agency already had this far-reaching authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. There are other aspects of the statute that we think lead to the same conclusion in Brown & Williamson. There's a fundamental inconsistency, the agency concluded, between attempting to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the national air ambient quality system, and that inconsistency is similar to the inconsistency that the Court pointed out in the Brown and Williamson case.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'd like you to address that. You said there was a lot of legislation in Congress that would have been pretty inconsistent with serious regulation by the FDA. And in this case, I don't think Congress is opposing the notion. I don't know anybody there who's in favor of global warming. And it seems to me they haven't passed laws that is actually, that would be significantly interfered with by the EPA trying to do its best to deal with this problem. Or am I wrong?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think you're wrong in the following respect, Your Honor.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What articles would be --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Congress has passed at least six separate statutes to specifically address the issue of global warming, and all of them share two common features. One, we want you to research this issue and learn more about it. And two, we want you to work on an international framework for addressing global climate change. The agency reasonably concluded that unilateral U.S. regulation of greenhouse gases --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there anything in the statute that prevents them from consulting with other nations or prevents the government from doing that when they determine how best to work out whatever standards or other forms of regulation they want?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There's nothing in the Clean Air Act, if that's the stature you're referring to, but I --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I presume the problem that they have in mind is that we have nothing to give in international negotiations. If we have done everything we can to reduce CO2, you know, what deal do we make with foreign nations? What incentive do they have to go along with us?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right, Your Honor. We've got a unique collective action problem, and yet, the reaction experience of the agency in dealing with the issue of stratospheric ozone depletion rate had precisely that situation, where the U.S. initially took steps. The stratospheric ozone depletion worsened, and it was only after international agreement was reached in the Montreal Protocol that a global solution to the problem was reached.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you think they have a good reason, yes or no? Because I'm not an expert in foreign affairs. The EPA probably is more than I am. But do you think that if they do rest their decision on their analysis of foreign affairs, that that is a proper basis for an agency like the EPA to refuse to regulate?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it's a proper basis within its inherent discretion, Your Honor, for at least two reasons. One, the agency is a part of the executive branch and it had unique experience with the issue of stratospheric ozone depletion. And two, Congress has made clear, for example in the Global Climate Protection Act of 1987, that the EPA has a role in at least reporting to Congress on international cooperation and efforts in that realm.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But Congress has not directed, don't regulate domestically for purposes of global warming.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's true, Your Honor, but --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The problem that I have with your reference to this very -- these various pieces of legislation that suggest that Congress has a different modus operandi in mind is that Congress certainly is aware that EPA has authority over pollutants, and it has never interfered with it.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, again, I think in looking at all the sources the agency looked to, the conclusion is, that the agency responsibly and prudently reached, is that Congress has not authorized it to embark on this regulatory endeavor. And I think the closest statute that comes to --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But isn't that a misstatement? Isn't the conclusion that they're trying to draw that Congress doesn't want them to exercise the authority they have for this purpose? And isn't that something quite different? And doesn't that raise the question whether that is a legitimate concern for them under the statute that does give them the authority?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I answer the question? No, Your Honor. I think the agency's conclusion was Congress had not authorized it to undertake the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to address global climate change and that, even if it had, that authority should not be exercised. Thank you very much.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Milkey, you have 3 minutes remaining.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34545 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Milkey, do you want us to send this case back to the EPA to ask them whether if only the last two pages of their opinion were given as a reason that would suffice? Would that make you happy?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would not make us happy, Your Honor.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I didn't think so. (Laughter.)
05-1120 +++$+++ 34548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, if I can address the global aspect of the problem, the fact that the solution to the whole problem --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What is your answer to Justice Scalia? Because I thought you said before that you thought it was appropriate for us to send this case back so that they could redetermine in light of proper considerations whether they wanted to exercise their authority.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is exactly --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Am I wrong about that?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, that is exactly what we want. I understood Justice Scalia to be saying --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's what I was asking, yes. And you think it will go back to them and they will say, oh my goodness, the scientific uncertainty is not enough by itself? You really expect that to happen?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Respectfully, Your Honor, I think EPA will have a hard time saying that there is insufficient -- I mean, too much scientific uncertainty. The very sentence --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They said it already.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The only question is whether that alone is enough.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Respectfully, Your Honor, they did not say that. They did not anywhere say why the existing uncertainty mattered. To the contrary, they emphasized the need to act in the face of current uncertainty, but never explained why that principle applies to a nonregulatory approach but not to a regulatory one.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What they said was until more is understood about causes, extent and significance of climate change and the potential options for addressing it, we believe it's inappropriate to regulate these emissions.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That strikes me as saying they think there is too much uncertainty for them to act.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34562 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, they did not say there is too much uncertainty for them to form a judgment, which is the key issue. They said they preferred more certainty, but because of the nature of the endangerment standard, which emphasizes the important of regulating in the face of uncertainty, they have to at least explain why the uncertainty matters. And that is -- what they did here is particularly troubling in the fact that they ignored all of the indications pointing toward endangerment. They looked at what we don't know without ever looking at what we do know.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the EPA concludes that regulating an air pollutant would endanger public health and welfare, can it decline to regulate?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not under section 202, Your Honor.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34565 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It has to regulate even if it concludes that regulation would make things worse?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34566 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would make things worse?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34567 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. No.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. If they thought there would be more endangerment that way they would not have to regulate.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then why can't they -- what is wrong with their view that for the United States to proceed unilaterally would make things worse and therefore they're going to decline to regular for that reason?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, first of all, I don't believe they actually said that, and there is nothing in the statute that even hints that they can take foreign policy considerations into account. To the contrary, the statute is very specific in other sections about when they're supposed to look at foreign emissions --
05-1120 +++$+++ 34572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't the definition of public welfare extremely broad?
05-1120 +++$+++ 34573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MILKEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, it is certainly extremely broad, and it does include climate. Thank you, Your Honor.
05-1120 +++$+++ 34574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34578 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument first today in Bell Atlantic Corporation vs. Twombly. Mr. Kellogg.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34580 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think the most important point that I can make today is that this is a case about the substantive requirements of antitrust law, and just as in Dura and in Blue Chip Stamps, the Court articulated the substantive requirements for pleading a claim under the securities law, and just as in Anza, it did so under RICO, so too in Associated General Contractors, in Trinko. And in the instant case, the Court is faced with the question of what a plaintiff needs to plead in order to state a claim and show an entitlement to relief under the antitrust laws. In that regard, I'd like to direct the Court's attention to paragraph 51 of the plaintiff's complaint in this case, which is at page 27 of the joint appendix, and which summarizes the grounds for plaintiffs' allegation that there is a contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade. The complaint states, and I quote, "in the absence of any meaningful competition among the defendants," and, quote, in light of the parallel course of conduct that each engaged in to prevent competition, the plaintiffs -- the defendants conspired.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but isn't the next sentence, the substance of the sentence is "plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that defendants have entered into a contract combination or conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their respective telephone and/or high speed interstate markets, and agreed not to compete with one another and otherwise allocated customers and markets to one another." Now, does that state a violation of the Sherman Act?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It does not, Your Honor.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It does not?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It does not state a claim.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, you could leave out everything before plaintiff, the part you quoted, that's not part of the declaration in the sentence. But the sentence itself alleges a garden variety of the violation of the Sherman Act, doesn't it?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The sentence recites the language of the Sherman Act, that is correct. But what this Court's cases indicate and what Rule 8 requires --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's got the language of the Sherman Act, a conspiracy to prevent competitive entry in their respective telephone and/or high speed markets. That's not in the Sherman Act, that's a description of the alleged conspiracy in this case.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is true that they have described the alleged conspiracy, but what Dura, Associated General Contractors, and other cases of this Court require is a statement of facts that warrants the legal conclusion that the plaintiffs wish to --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Kellogg, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure assiduously avoid using the word fact throughout. And from 1938 on, it has been repeated that it is not necessary to plead facts. The index of forms, the appendix of forms shows how simple the plain statement of a claim is, and you're not required to plead facts. And yet that's the central -- seems to be the central thrust of your argument.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, every case of this Court dealing with pleading standards has indicated that it is not sufficient merely to recite a legal conclusion, and claim an entitlement to relief therefore. In Dura, for example, the plaintiffs claimed proximate cause and loss causation, and the Court said --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Mr. Kellogg, that's not a legal conclusion, it's an allegation of fact that there was an agreement to prevent competitive entry into respective markets. There are dozens of antitrust complaints that are no more specific than that.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, in the context in which this claim is made, the allegation of agreement or conspiracy is not a statement of fact. It is an inference that the plaintiffs seek to draw from the facts that they allege in the complaint. Context here is everything. In form 9, for example, Justice Ginsburg, or in the case of Sherkovitz, you had a specific context. You had a time, a place, individual participants named, a clear injury in form 9, a broken leg as a report --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But negligently drove. It doesn't say whether it went through a stop light. Doesn't say whether it was speeding. It doesn't say any one of the umpteen ways one could be negligent.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct, Justice O'Connor, but you have a direct context -- Justice Ginsburg, you had a direct context in which an eyewitness participant in the event is claiming negligence on behalf of the driver of the car. In the instant case, we have no injury that's separate from the alleged conspiracy, and we have no time, place or participants for the alleged conspirators.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you do have a case -- anywhere, forget antitrust. Suppose it's a tort case, and the following complaint is filed. My foot hurts. I've gone to Dr. Smith for 15 years. I claim he is negligent. Is that valid?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I do not think so, because I don't think --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Now, if you think that's valid, I understand that you think this complaint does just what I said in the field of antitrust. But is there any case that you've come across which would say a complaint just as I have described it --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Either is valid or is not valid. You'd like to find one that says it's not valid, so what's your best effort in any field of law.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would cite, for example, the Court's decision in the Papasan case, where the plaintiffs claimed that they were not getting a minimally adequate education. That sounds like a factual statement. But what the Court expressly said in that case is that we do not have to accept legal conclusions in the guise of factual allegations.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But of course, there the legal standard was not clear. And the Dura case, I looked at, and perhaps you disagree based on what you -- what I have just heard, and I thought Dura was a lack of proximate cause. They just didn't show any relation between the injury they alleged to have suffered, and their own.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think Dura is --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that's the way I read Dura.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think Dura is an exact analogy. In Dura, they allege proximate cause, they allege loss causation. And the Court said, well, let's look at their statement of facts, which only showed that they had bought at an inflated price. And the Court said there was a fatal gap between that factual allegation and the legal conclusion that they wished to draw.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You can get into trouble by alleging too much, I guess, because if you allege a lot, you might leave something out. And you say, well, what about that one. But suppose we keep it very, very minimal. And a person just says, I'm hurt and the defendant, I claim, negligently injured me. Period. Period.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That would not provide --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, why not?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The grounds upon which the claim is based.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So the only thing that's missing there are some facts.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Some facts indicative that the defendant is responsible for the --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34611 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. So now you're saying a complaint has to have facts?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34612 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34613 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I thought you were also making a different argument. I thought you were making the argument that they have, by their pleadings, in effect, affirmatively indicated that they don't have enough facts to support a general allegation. I thought you were saying that because of the preface that you began reading, that in view simply of the fact that they are not competing, and in view of parallel conduct, they have violated the Act. So I guess my question is, would your position be different if there were no allegation simply of an absence of competition and parallel action if -- would your position be different if they had simply alleged, as Justice Stevens emphasized, that here were these parties and they had -- they had taken some action, not specified, which resulted in violation of the Act?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34614 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our position would not be different. It's the uniform view of the cases that I cited, the Courts of Appeals and a requirement of Rule -- Rule 8 that you do more than simply parrot the words of the cause of action or announce legal conclusions. But as you point out, in this case --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34615 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that would not be good enough, but are you saying that this is worse because, in effect, they have gone some steps towards specification. And the specifications that they have made affirmatively show that they don't have enough for the agreement.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is certainly true that all they have alleged is conduct from which they seek to draw an inference of conspiracy. And they have made that quite clear, that they have made no direct allegation.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you're saying that inference cannot be drawn from the particular facts that they have alleged.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34618 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct. Our position is that as a matter of substantive antitrust law, what this Court said in Matsushita is that antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences that can be drawn from parallel conduct. And if all you have is parallel conduct that's consistent, on the one hand, with conspiracy, or on the other hand, with ordinary business judgment, you cannot draw an inference of the sort that the plaintiffs depend upon in this case.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34619 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course, that may be true on summary judgment, you may be dead right on the merits, but are you telling me that an allegation that the defendants have agreed not to compete with one another is not a statement of fact?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34620 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I am. I would say that that's a -- that's a conclusion --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34621 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what if they said they agreed in writing not to compete with one another, would that be sufficient? Or if they have agreed orally not to compete with one another, would that be sufficient?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34622 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If there were a specific context and they said --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34623 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If they said they have agreed orally not to compete with one another, would that be a statement of fact, an allegation of fact?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Because you require --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then why did you leave the words orally out? Why is it not a statement, allegation of fact?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because the plaintiffs here were very careful, in light of Rule 11, not to make any direct allegations of conspiracy, not to suggest that there was a time and place --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's a direct allegation of conspiracy, that very statement.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But they make it clear in that paragraph that it's an inference.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They make it fairly clear that they may only have the evidence of parallel conduct that you describe, and that may not be sufficient, and maybe for that reason, you get a summary judgment. But how you can say this is not an allegation of fact, I find mind-boggling.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm saying that it's not sufficient to state a claim. Just as the allegation that there was lost causation in Dura, or that there was harm to the union in Associated General Contractors or there, that there was harm --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now you're, that's the part precisely which you're following that I don't, that I actually don't know, is the extent to which you have to put in a complaint, in whatever field of law, you can allege a fact. You say the person ran over me --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or you say, they treated me negligently. That's a fact. That means something happened there. But suppose you write the complaint and there is just no notion that you have a what and when, how, under what circumstances. It's just totally out of thin air, and the defendant doesn't know what, what period of time he is supposed to be thinking about, what, what happens to such a complaint? There must be some law on it in torts or someplace?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, ordinarily in a complaint like that, you could file a 12(e) motion and ask for more specificity. Our problem --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, why couldn't you do the same?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our problem with the current complaint is not a lack of specificity, it's quite specific. It provides color maps and such. The problem is that the facts specifically alleged simply don't amount to an antitrust violation because they don't support the inference that the plaintiffs ask the Court to draw.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, but they're -- they're using the fact that there was parallel behavior as a basis for thinking there was more than parallel behavior. They are using it as a basis for thinking that once, on some occasion that's relevant, there were people meeting in a room and saying things to each other. So they are not just saying that it's sufficient. They are saying it's evidence that something else occurred.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. That's exactly what they are saying and what Matsushita and the other courses, cases of this Court dealing with parallel conduct indicate, is that that's not a fair inference from parallel conduct.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wasn't that a summary judgment case and hadn't there been discovery before? The Matsushita decision?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct. But the Court announced that as a principle of substantive law. They said substantive antitrust law limits the range of permissible inferences. We are not suggesting that the plaintiffs need the sort of specificity or certainly any evidence at the pleadings stage. For example --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They just have to say orally, I wish you would reconsider that? Because if that's, if that's all you're arguing, I don't see anything to be gained by -- by such a holding. It doesn't tell you -- you know, this is a suit against a number of large corporations, nationwide businesses, thousands of employees. And on this complaint you have no idea who agreed with whom, where, when, any of that. I can understand that you're saying that does not give us enough notice to prepare a defense. But if you say oh, but it would be perfectly all right so long as they said orally. I mean -- forget about it.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I should not agree to that. That's simply adding the word orally. It's certainly fair when you are talking about a nationwide class over a period of 10 years attacking an entire industry to suggest that the plaintiffs have to give some indication of what it is that the defendants have done that is wrong. Some concrete basis for the Court to believe there is a reason to go forward to the --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So in the negligently drove case, the plaintiff negligently drove over -- the defendant negligently drove over the plaintiff, if it's not specific as to time and place it must be dismissed? If it's specific as to time and place it's, it withstands the motion?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well certainly, Form 9 is very specific. It gives a specific corner, it gives a time, it gives the names of the participants.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What if it does say within the last 10 years.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think that's sufficient, Your Honor. But with a -- with a --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you have a case, do you have a case I can look to that tells me that?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With a negligence case a 12(e) motion could then specify the actual time and place, but the plaintiffs here have had ample opportunity to amend their complaint to supplement. If they had any specifics indicating that there was such an agreement as opposed to lawyer speculation and a desire to engage in expensive discovery they would have produced that.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Did you seek a more specific statement?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We did not, Your Honor.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why not? Why didn't you ask when and where was this agreement.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well again the whole way this was litigated below by the plaintiffs was that they, they acknowledged they had no specifics. They simply asked that an inference be drawn from the parallel conduct they alleged. And that is our central point that you simply cannot infer an agreement from this conduct. If the Court has no questions, I reserve my time.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Kellogg. Mr. Barnett.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34655 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. The fundamental concern of the United States is that the decision of the Second Circuit can be read to hold that a Section 1 Sherman Act complaint will survive a motion to dismiss merely by alleging parallel action or inaction in attaching the bare assertion of an agreement. Such a result fails to appreciate that parallel action or inaction is ubiquitous in our economy and often reflects beneficial competitive forces.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What do you mean can be held, can be thought to hold that? Is there any interpretation of what they did.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well there are certain portions of the decision that talk about a plausibility requirement but when it turns to the specific area of a Section 1 complaint and a complaint alleged on parallel conduct, I agree with you, Justice Scalia, that that's the only interpretation I can draw from that passage. The Court held that if you allege parallel action unless there are no set of facts that can be proved, and it's always possible to hypothesize an agreement, you cannot dismiss that complaint.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, is that really what they -- I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that the, that the Court spoke of no set of facts, only on the assumption that there had been a pleading which did raise a plausible, possible inference of forbidden conduct, and I thought the Court was saying if the, if the plausibility criterion has been satisfied, then the only way that the defendant can get a dismissal is by showing that there is no set of facts which would actually support the action. And I'm not sure that that can be done at the, at the, at the stage of simply pleading a dismissal as opposed to summary judgment or something like that. But I thought the Court did not get to its no set of facts point until it had first assumed that there had been a, a pleading on the basis of which a plausible inference of forbidden conduct could be drawn. Am I about that?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Souter, I read that passage of the Second Circuit decision as not expressly referencing the plausibility requirement. There is language saying that the allegation needs to be plausible but when you get to this specific passage it says that if you allege parallel conduct a court cannot dismiss the claim unless there could be no set of facts that could be proved. But regardless, even if I am, your interpretation is potentially permissible interpretation, the fundamental concern of the United States is that this Court, having the case now, clarify that a Section 1 Sherman Act complaint should not be able to survive a motion to dismiss unless it alleges some facts beyond mere generic parallel action.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So, so that if plausibility is the standard this does not meet the standard of plausibility, that's your argument?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we prefer the formulation that, from the Court's opinion in Dura that says that the facts need to demonstrate some reasonably founded expectation that there is an unlawful agreement within the meaning of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And some parallel action would indicate that wouldn't it? I mean, if for example they, you have nine companies that change their price at the same hour of the same day, 10 months in a row.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Justice Scalia. I agree.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you're, you're not saying that parallel action can never create this, this kind of --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct. If all you know is that there is parallel action or inaction, that in and of itself tells you nothing. Once you start to add the facts and circumstances surrounding it, particular parallel action can be suspicious enough, and the example you give is a good one, that demonstrates a reasonably founded expectation for believing that discovery may yield evidence showing that that parallel price increase at the same time by nine different companies was the result of an unlawful conspiracy. If I can turn to, in -- in deciding whether or not there is such a reasonably founded expectation, you do need to look to the substantive law. Here the issue is the law on agreement under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Some of the questions I think I've heard go to this issue. Section 1 law specifically limits the kinds of facts that can be used to establish an agreement that is cognizable under the Sherman Act. In particular, the Court's rulings made clear that conscious parallelism which some economists might argue is a form of an agreement, is not an agreement within the meaning of Section 1.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's clear it's not sufficient to prove it, but is it admissible evidence?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It may be admissible evidence but depending on the facts and circumstances --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Should a plaintiffs's complaint fail because it includes unnecessary, verbose, admissible evidence?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. It should fail if it fail -- if it does not allege facts that indicate reasonable found --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is not it an allegation that they've agreed not to compete with one another an allegation of fact?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is a combined question of law and fact in our view, because as I said the Section 1 law limits the kinds of facts that can be used to establish an agreement. If all they have alleged is parallel action without more --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But they have alleged more. They have alleged an actual agreement.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But as paragraph 51 of the complaint is, as you were discussing, in some ways even worse. Because it specifically relies upon parallel action and alleged parallel inaction.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what if it didn't? I mean, I mean face the question that Justice Stevens puts. Suppose you have a complaint that says nothing else except that these defendants entered into an agreement in -- in restraint of trade.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that is not sufficient because in our view the complaint needs to allege some facts that demonstrate a basis for believing there was an unlawful agreement within --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What if the complaint in addition to that alleged that up to a certain date, it was unlawful for the companies to compete with one another but the law was changed and after that change took place they were advised by their lawyers they could compete, but they agreed not to. Would that be sufficient?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. Every business, every day fails to enter some new line of business or take some potential competitive action. The mere --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Justice Stevens's question was that the allegation was that after that date they agreed not to compete. That states -- that states a cause of action under the Sherman Act, doesn't it?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I would, with respect, Mr. Chief Justice, I would disagree with that. There still needs in our view to be some allegation that indicates -- a factual allegation that indicates a reason for believing there may have been unlawful agreement.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can they say on the 14th of January, 2004, we believe that in the city of New York, they agreed upon this course of action? That would surely be sufficient?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That may be sufficient because it is providing enough facts to give you a reason to believe that the plaintiff has a basis for --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's saying, all I've done is limited it in time and space. Just as you might say on October the 24th, 2004 at the corner of 14th and Third Avenue, defendant drove negligently and injured me. That's certainly a complaint, isn't it?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, and it -- you -- you --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't it?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It needs to allege enough specifics --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, look, the one I just alleged in the tort law is a complaint. I've just copied it out of the model complaints.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I want to be clear --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Am I right or not?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The facts allege need to be specific enough to suggest --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I understand the standard.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I want to know how to apply the standard and now I take my tort case --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- which is okay, and now I say sometime during the last 10 years he drove negligently and injured me. Is that no good?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In my view that's probably insufficient --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And so you're saying that this case is like that, when because they don't say when they met, they don't say what happened, they don't give a time or place. If that's, leaving your side parallelism out of it, I'm past you on that, all right? I'll accept for argument's sake all your point about that. Now if you're saying this is too vague, leaving that out of it, because it doesn't say time and place of the meetings or give any other clue for meetings etcetera, what's your best authority ? This is an area of law I'm not familiar with. I'm looking for cases that will tell me how specific a complaint has to be to tie the events down to specific ones.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe that this Court's decision in Dura Pharmaceutical --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Dura is still the best. I think I, did I write that case? (Laughter.)
05-1126 +++$+++ 34699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You did --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not drawing total comfort from it. (Laughter.)
05-1126 +++$+++ 34701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In fact I'd like something in tort law or something that, you know, that I get a general idea of what the law is because I don't know that antitrust is --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Barnett, I thought --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought our brief lists cases that go to that point.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Barnett I thought you had, you had said that you don't need to indicate the particular day of the agreement. That it would be enough if it was the kind of parallel action that suggested an agreement that over nine years they all raised the price at the same time. Now that doesn't really give the defendant notice of, you know, what individuals were responsible for this, when it occurred. But you say that would still be adequate?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it does provide notice that -- this is a fairly low threshold. It provides some indication. It can be an indication of direct evidence. It can be an indication of circumstantial evidence. It does focus the litigation, however, by providing a, a reason why the court and the defendant should be defending themselves against a section 1 claim. My time is up.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Barnett. Mr. Richards, we'll hear now from you.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34708 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: There are four essential dimensions to the problem that's before the Court and on every one of those dimensions the guidance that the Solicitor General gave in its amicus brief in the Swierkiewicz case is 180 degrees opposite the guidance that the Solicitor General is providing in its amicus brief in this case. The first of those dimensions I'll begin with because it's where petitioners began. In their brief, the Solicitor General in the Swierkiewicz case very clearly said that evidentiary standards cannot be made into pleading standards. What they said on page 5 was that by requiring pleading of the McDonnell Douglas prima facie case from employment law the Second Circuit had erroneously conflated the fair notice owed the defendant at the outset of the litigation with the standards governing the plaintiff's present of proof in court. Later at page 11, they said the court's test confuses pleading --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now you're reading from the Swierkiewicz brief?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ From the Swierkiewicz Solicitor General brief. They said that the court test in the Second Circuit that was reversed --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, i mean, you know, that's shame on them. But we're trying to get this case right and, you know, I don't care what position they took before. I care about what the right answer is, and I find it difficult to believe that you can simply allege in a complaint, I was injured by the negligence of the defendant in driving an automobile, period. Does that satisfy the, the Federal Rules?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There's a big difference between -- the answer is I don't know, perhaps.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Perhaps?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Perhaps. But that's very different from this case and it's different in that an automobile accident is something that happens all in one moment in time. An antitrust conspiracy like the conspiracy alleged --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The agreement happens at one moment in time.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, it could happen in many moments.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Meetings of the minds, meeting of the minds. I used to each Contracts. Meeting of the minds at one moment in time, okay.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what the Second Circuit said on this point, and I submit that the Second Circuit was correct, was that the complaint does set forth the temporal and geographic parameters of the alleged illegal activity and the identities of the alleged key participants, and I think that's correct.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34719 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But where does it set forth agreement?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34720 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It alleges --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34721 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Temporal, geographic, the identities, but where does it set forth anything evincing an agreement other than the allegation of parallel conduct?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It alleges that there was an agreement, but it doesn't prove that there was an agreement because proving the facts alleged is not a plaintiff's burden in the complaint.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you have any, is there an allegation of an agreement apart from the parallel conduct?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what does that consist of?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The leading plus factor that's generally used in, in the Matsushita context, in the Monsanto context, is action that would have been against the self-interest of the conspirators in the absence of a conspiracy, and this complaint alleges very clearly that the conduct of not entering into one another's territories and competing among the ILECs as a CLEC was contrary to what would have been --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it states -- would it state an antitrust violation if had you a grocery store on one corner of the block and a pet store on the other corner of the block and you say, well, the grocery store is not selling pet supplies and they could make money if they did, therefore that's an antitrust violation?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that conspiracy were implausible, if it made no sense.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's all the facts that are alleged.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34730 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, but the Second Circuit standard and the standard we defend is that if someone alleges a conspiracy I that just makes no sense because it's obvious from the face of the complaint that the alleged conspirators aren't in the same product market, not in the same geographic market or something of that kind, there is no conceivable motive for them to enter into the kind of conspiracy at hand, the complaint can be dismissed.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34731 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If my case, the gasoline, oil prices fell, but I happen to know there were four gasoline shops near each other, gasoline stations, and they didn't cut their prices. Complaint?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34732 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34733 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, then that's the economy, and you can go sue half the firms in this economy. Every firm in a concentrated industry engages in -- I mean, normally conscious parallelism, and I know there are economists who think that that should be the case, but I thought the law to date was that the Department of Justice is not given by the Sherman Act the authority to remake the entire American economy. But if we accept your view I guess it is.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Breyer, in the NHL case, the National Hockey League case, which is one of the cases that the petitioners relied upon for a circuit conflict to get here, what the court said is that allegations that defendant's action taken independently would be contrary to their economic self-interest will ordinarily tend to exclude the likelihood --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ordinarily, if you take that sentence and read it for how you're reading, a consciously parallel action is a violation of Sherman Act section 2, then we have that radical change that many have advocated for the last 40 or 50 years, that half the economy is in violation, because in any concentrated industry, after all, it is in the interest of a firm to cut prices and to make a large market unless he knows his three competitors will also keep prices up. Now, you have to know that or you'd cut them. And that's called conscious parallelism. And I had always thought that this Court had not said that that in and of itself is a violation of the Sherman Act.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Breyer, we don't just allege conscious parallelism. We allege --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I know that, but if in fact all you have to do in order to bring a price-fixing case and get into discovery is to allege conscious parallelism and then add without further foundation, and we think there was a real agreement too, but there's nothing other than the conscious parallelism to back it up, now we've got just what I said, with the exception you might not win at the end of the day. What have you is a ticket to conduct discovery. Now, that's what's bothering the Department of Justice and so I'd like to know the answer to that problem.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Breyer, the difference between that, a critical difference between that scenario and what we have alleged in this complaint is that we do allege in great detail that not entering into one another's territories would have been contrary to the interests of --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that does not help you with respect to the other claim, the claim that there was a conspiracy to prevent upstart competitors from coming in. There's no plus factor as I understand it alleged there, and I also understand that it would have been entirely in the interest of each of your defendants to keep the upstarts out and that there is no need for them to agree to do that. It would be the most natural thing in the world to do it. What do you say about that part of your case?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As to that aspect of the case, paragraph 50 does allege two plus factors, but they are essentially allegations of common motive, which is a less strong, I'll grant you --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but a common, isn't the common motive consistent, just as consistent with no agreement as with agreement? In other words, they didn't have to agree; their common motive was operative agreement or not?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The important thing as to that aspect of the conspiracy is the Continental case in this Court, which said that you're not supposed to dismember -- it's an inappropriate way to approach a conspiracy to dismember it, look at one piece of it in isolation, evaluate it as though it's by itself and then wipe the slate clean at the end of that analysis, and that's essentially what the other side is trying to do repeatedly.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, what the other side is saying is that simply by alleging parallelism when it would be in the interest of each of the alleged conspirators to do just as you claim they are doing in the absence of an agreement, you have not alleged something that gets to the threshold of plausibility. That's their argument and I, I --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think, by the way, that that argument applies not just to the keeping out the upstart claim, but also to the not entering the other alleged conspirator s' fields of monopoly, if you want to put it that way, because if I, if I enter your field I know that you're going to enter mine. It just doesn't pay for me to do it. Yeah, I can make money, but I'll lose money. It seems to me perfectly natural for companies that have a certain geographic area in which they are the, the principal, the selected instrument and although they technically can enter somebody else's geographic area, they know that if they do it they will be subjected to the same thing. That is nothing more than conscious parallelism.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You may reply to us jointly or severally, however you may want. (Laughter.)
05-1126 +++$+++ 34746 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I may, I'll try to pose a hypothetical that I think addresses Justice Souter's question and then, Justice Scalia, I'll try to address your question. Justice Souter, a good example would be suppose one alleges a conspiracy to rob a bank and to steal a number of getaway cars at the same time and one comes -- in order to get away, so that the conspirators couldn't be found at the site of robbing the bank. One could say, well, there's a reason to rob the getaway cars totally independent of the bank and without a conspiracy. Why do they need a conspiracy to steal a car? Why isn't that something that they wouldn't individually do?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34747 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the difference between that case and this is that the allegation with respect to the agreement to procure the getaway cars gets to a kind of specificity that is not present here. Here the allegation simply is parallel conduct to make it hard for the upstarts to get in. And at that general level the answer is, of course anyone in his right mind would want to make it difficult to let the upstarts in. There's no need to assume that they might have agreed on some matter of detail which is not essential to the scheme. This is a general characteristic of competition and resistance of competition.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34748 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understand, but the point I'm trying to make with the hypothetical is that what one does if one is just looking at the conspiracy to keep CLECs out by itself first, taking the secondary aspect of the conspiracy, putting it first and analyzing it in isolation, is like taking the getaway car theft, analyzing it in isolation, saying, well, they have a reason individually to steal the cars, so I guess that couldn't --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34749 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Richards, can I ask you this question. Supposing that you were allowed to have discovery and each chief executive of the defendant companies got on the stand and said: I never talked to my, my competitors at all, I never seriously considered competing in the other, other company's territory for the reasons set forth in the, in your opponent's brief on the merits here. We never did agree. And you're able to prove the things you've alleged in the agreement. Would the, would it be appropriate to enter summary judgment against you on that testimony if you had no evidence of a specific agreement?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In the context of summary judgment or at trial, we would be required to prove what we have now alleged.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But my question is you can prove what you've now alleged factually, but they deny the existence of any agreement and they explained the reasons for it exactly as the lawyers did in this brief. Would you not lose on summary judgment?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If we don't have proof at that point of what we've alleged here, we'd lose --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ After several years --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Prove what you have alleged, in effect, except for the key allegation of agreement among the competitors. If you had no other evidence of that agreement, would you win.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34755 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If we had proof that they actually acted against what would have been their self-interest in the absence of a conspiracy, we would satisfy then the Matsushita standard for summary judgment.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34756 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't understand acting in self interest. I mean, they might just decide apart from, you know, if they go into their territory they'll come into mine, that investing in this wired business isn't the best, the best bet for them. Maybe they want to get into the wireless business and think that's a better way to spend their money.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BARNETT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Surely it is possible to conceive of facts under which they would not have not conspired and they would have had a different motive, but that's not the legal standard under Conley versus Gibson.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I'm questioning you. You say you meet the plus factor because they were acting against their self- interest, that a self-interested player in this league would have gone into the other's territory, and I'm questioning that by saying that they might have seen this whole area as not the best place to invest their money.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understand that. But we have alleged that as fact, Justice Ginsburg, and that fact and that allegation has to be treated as true under conventional pleading standards for purposes of a motion to dismiss. If we are unable to prove that fact when we get to summary judgment --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You mean the mere fact that you have alleged something is against their self-interest is enough to make an issue of fact on whether it's against their self-interest?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, yes.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They could have gone on the stand, they gave all the reasons in the red briefs -- or the blue briefs in this case, that say it's not against their self-interest; you'd say that would be a jury question?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, not at summary judgment. What I'm saying is that at the pleading stage to allege that, which is an allegation of fact, satisfies pleading standards. Just to allege it with testimony on the other side and no evidence to prove that allegation on summary judgment --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are you suggesting that you don't have to prove an actual agreement? You can merely prove conduct contrary to self-interest is sufficient?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Conduct contrary to self-interest is a way of inferring actual agreement in the absence of direct evidence.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you agree you must -- do you agree that you must prove an actual agreement among the defendants?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There must be an inference of actual agreement, but the inference can be drawn from circumstantial evidence, and that's what Matsushita is all about.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So then when we get back to the paragraph 51, let me start with your statement at the bottom half of that paragraph, that plaintiffs allege upon information and belief that they have entered into a contract, is a conclusion based upon your prior allegations, it's not an independent allegation of an agreement. It's saying because of this parallel conduct, because we think it's contrary to their self interest, therefore, they have agreed.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Counsel presented it as though it's a complete summary of everything, but what it says is, and the other facts and market circumstances alleged above, and it's preceded by --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it's a statement of a conclusion based upon your allegations that precede it.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not a statement that independently there apart from all of this, there's an agreement.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's also an independent statement and allegation on information and belief, which is permitted under Rule 8, that there is agreement.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I guess if you had just alleged the last part of paragraph 51, plaintiffs have alleged, plaintiffs allege upon information and belief, et cetera, without the detail that you provided, would that have been sufficient?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you gave no context of what kind of a conspiracy you were alleging and what kind of scope it had, so that a court could balance --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you omit all the allegations about parallel conduct and the other allegations that you think provide a basis for inferring a conspiracy from the parallel conduct, if you omit all that but you just include the last part of 51, would that be enough?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If there isn't enough in the way of facts alleged to permit a court to understand what it is you're claiming in general terms happening, then you haven't satisfied Rule 8. I mean --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's the answer to Justice Alito's question in this case?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, in this case we have provided, as the Second Circuit --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. His hypothetical is all you've done is to allege the final sentence without the preceding clause, the five or six lines before there's a comma. That's out. All there is is the allegation of the conspiracy. Is that enough in this case?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In this case with the allegations of the nature of the conspiracy that precede that sentence, it's enough.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. The hypothetical is without the preceding clause. Is that enough --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34783 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That sentence by itself --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34784 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that enough in this case for what Justice Alito asked, and I think we are interested in the answer that you make given this complaint in this case that we are faced with.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that that would satisfy conventional pleading standards under Rule 8(a). On the other hand, I don't think it would satisfy the Second Circuit's standard below, because the Second Circuit required enough facts to enable a court to wrap its mind around a complainant, understanding what it is you claimed happened. You don't have to prove your case as a complainant, you just have to --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'd also like a clear answer, and I would like to go back to Justice Stevens' question because I'm not sure what you're thinking there. We have three steel sheet companies in the United States, no more. They sell at $10 a sheet. One day we have action in the case, a memo to the president of the company. He says Mr. President, if you cut your prices to $7 you will make even more money unless the others go along. And if they get there first, you will lose money. So whether they cut or not, you'd better cut your prices. Reply from the president: But if I don't cut my prices, they won't cut theirs, and we are all better off. That's your evidence. Do you win?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That would depend on the vehicle --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is no depend. That's the evidence. Do you win?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that's the evidence, I think I win.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. And you cite Matsushita for that?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. For that I would cite Judge Posner's decision.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you're right, then I guess we could engage in this major restructuring of the economy, and if that's the law, I'm surprised they haven't done it, but maybe they have just been recalcitrant.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there's no major restructuring of the --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, because we have concentrated industries throughout the economy, I guess, or at least we used to, and I suppose that that's a perfectly valid way of reasoning for an executive in such a company, at least they teach that at the schools of government, and people who aren't really experienced in these things, but --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the way Judge Posner explains it in High Fructose is to say that it is possible to have an agreement without a moment where there's a statement of agreement. The participants in a conspiracy can possibly treat what one of them does as an offer, which another one can accept by following it, to satisfy that way of showing a conspiracy.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay, fine. Now, let's forget my immediate disagreement or not. Let's say I agree with you on this. Now we have our example right in mind. What other than the parallel to my example could one reading this complaint think you intend to prove?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34797 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, the strongest -- plus factors that, in the absence of direct evidence of conspiracy at the outset of a case, which private plaintiffs will almost never have because people don't conspire in public parks. All a plaintiff can have is what are called plus factors under Matsushita, and the strongest of those plus factors is what has been alleged in great detail in this complaint of action against self interest. The case law recognizes that --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34798 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But how do you tell? I mean, companies get proposals all the time. Here's a way you could make more money. You could all enter the market in some foreign country. The people decide, I mean, life is short and they've got certain objectives, and they don't have to do everything that an economist might think is in their economic self interest. I mean, what is the limiting self interest to that?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34799 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is different from that because this is a situation where when the Telecommunications Act was passed in 1996, Congress expected that the ILECs would compete in one another's territories as CLECs. The defendants pledged that they would compete in one another's territories at ILECs. They then for years in Congress complained that the CLECs who were trying to compete with them were given an unfair advantage in the terms and conditions on which they were permitted to --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34800 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it an adequate response for the executive to say, I'm a little risk averse, I want to see how things work out over the next five years. They keep changing the laws, the regulatory environment. That's why I didn't jump in and compete?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34801 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If they can prove that that's the reason why they didn't jump in and compete, then they have a nonconspiratorial reason for what they did.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34802 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if they don't do that, is it your argument that simply by behaving differently from the way Congress assumed when it passed the statute, that raises the plausible inference of violation?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34803 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Within the other facts that I was identifying, there is a strong suggestion here that competition as a CLEC would have been, in the absence of the pattern of conduct that we allege here, would have been a profitable endeavor.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34804 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. But is part of the plausibility of that inference the fact, in your argument, the fact that Congress assumed that would happen?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34805 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's one factor that I point to among several to --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34806 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I mean, the congressional assumption is part of your case, in other words?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34807 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34809 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I believe that along with other factors such as the constant complaints to Congress about how CLECs had the better side of the deal than the ILECs, along with the pledges of the defendants that they would do, and that they didn't do.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34810 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I used to work in the field of telecommunications and if the criterion is that happens which Congress expected to happen when it passed its law, your case is very weak.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34811 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, that -- I certainly don't expect that that is the evidence that we would be relying on at trial or at summary judgment to support our case, but in our motion to dismiss we don't have to have the evidence to support our case.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34812 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you need what is called the plus factor, and I gather that you acknowledge that if I disagree with you that this, this parallel action seemed to be against the self interest of the companies, you no longer have a plus factor and you would lose.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34813 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think that the Court, if the Court comes to a conclusion on its own that the facts that we have alleged, which is that it would have been in their interest to do this in the absence of conspiracy, is wrong, then the Court is not following conventional pleading standards.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34814 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So all you have to do to prove, to establish a plus factor is to say in your pleading, and there is a plus factor?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you have to say what it is.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You have to say what it is, that's all, and even if it's implausible?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if it's implausible, that might be a different consideration.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Richards, didn't the Second Circuit say you don't need a plus factor? They said if you did, we think that the plaintiffs could show it, but the second sentence is you don't need a plus factor.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34820 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that can be wrong or right, but the Second Circuit was very clear that Rule 8 wants a plain statement of the claim and no plus factor.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34821 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I agree with that, Your Honor, and my contention as to what the law is is that we are not required to plead plus factors. But the fact remains that we have, and that our factual pleading of plus factors has to be treated as true for purposes of a --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What if you pled more than you had to, and it's clear from what you pled that you were drawing an implausible inference? Can't the complaint then be dismissed for failure to state a claim?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I don't believe that it can be if -- because the Court is not, the correct function of the Court under a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is not to be decided by whether it believes or is persuaded by the allegations in the complaint.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let's take the Form 9 where you take the form complaint for an automobile accident, and suppose what it says is, I was injured in an automobile accident at a particular place in time. I was hit by a compact car with Massachusetts plates. The defendant owns the compact car with Massachusetts plates. That's the complaint. The Court can't dismiss that for failure to state a claim when it's apparent from the face of the claim that you're, that the basis for suing the defendant is a totally implausible inference?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if the allegation is also made that the defendant was negligent, then I think it clearly satisfies the pleading standard under Form 9. I think it would be a more detailed complaint than the sample that comprises Form 9 of the rules.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34826 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Even if it reveals that the only basis for identifying this person as the defendant is the fact that the person has a Massachusetts license plate and a compact car?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, because that's more than nothing, and the rule in Form 9 contains nothing.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it contains a time and a place. It's quite specific that there was an accident and that defendant, defendant of a certain name at a certain time and place negligently drove. What it doesn't tell you is the details of the, of what was negligent, but it certainly is specific in time and place and person, which is one of the -- one of the concerns, I mean, if you strip away everything, it seems that you have a suspicion that there may have been a conspiracy and you want to use a discovery process to find out whether or not that's true. Isn't that essentially what this complaint is?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is the situation that any plaintiff is going to be in in a horizontal conspiracy case in the sense that we don't know for certain that there was a conspiracy. We have observed market facts which are suggestive of a conspiracy and we allege that there was a conspiracy. Now under conventional standards, all we would have to do is allege that there was a conspiracy and say what it was. We wouldn't have to plead a basis to infer that we are correct or incorrect because that's not the analysis that Rule 12(b)(6) --
05-1126 +++$+++ 34830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you don't think you have to prove that either? I mean, you don't think you have to prove anything more than what you've alleged in the complaint about the background context, the parallel conduct?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the Court -- if we were to prove to the satisfaction of the finder of fact that the conduct we have pointed to here was or would have been contrary to the interests of the defendants in the absence of a conspiracy, we were to prove that as distinguished from pleading, we would satisfy Matsushita. Now at that stage in the case, it's inconceivable that there won't be all kinds of other memos and, you know, real world things that will shed light on why the defendants internally think they did this.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How much money do you think it would have cost the defendants by then to assemble all of the documents that you're going to be interested in looking at? How many buildings will have to be rented to store those documents and how many years will be expended in, in gathering all the materials?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, to address that concern, which we share, because we don't gain anything with Matsushita. At the end of the road in the case, we don't gain anything by pursuing a case for years in an unnecessarily burdensome way if we are not sure that it's going to prevail. So we proposed in this case a phased discovery process, pursuant to which you would first have discovery into conspiracy, and then the Court would have an early opportunity for a Matsushita motion and we either carry the day at that point or we don't. That's discovery.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ At what point does it get characterized as a class action, before this discovery or after?
05-1126 +++$+++ 34835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's at the Court's discretion when to entertain the motion for class certification. In this particular case the defendants, a couple of the defendants proposed that we include in that phased discovery proposal class certification as an additional subject of that first phase of discovery, and we would be amenable to that as a compromise. But the point, getting back to Justice Scalia's point, that discovery as to whether there was a conspiracy in this case in order to satisfy that first phased analysis, would not need to be terribly burdensome and wouldn't necessarily be more burdensome than all kinds of other cases. It's really a very targeted issue. I think it's actually an appropriate way to deal with cases of this kind and it's actually a way that the Court has proposed dealing with similar issues in the past in the Anderson versus Creighton case.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, how would it be focused if you're talking about whether it's in their economic interest? You would have to say why, why didn't you enter into this particular realm of competition and they would say, well because we were doing other things. We had other areas that we were focusing on. And they would have to document all that to your satisfaction.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. RICHARDS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We'd -- we would ask for production of documents reflecting their thinking process about entering into one another's territories. And that would be very enlightening. And after we get those documents we would have a much clearer idea and be able to share with the Court a much clearer idea of the entire picture of a kind that we can't have at the 12(b)(6) stage. Thank you.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you Mr. Richard, Mr. Kellogg, you have four minutes remaining.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34840 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. KELLOGG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. Your Honor. I have three quick points that I would like to make. First following up on Justice Ginsburg's point, the private plaintiffs do not have an authority to issue purely investigative complaints. The Department of Justice of course can issue civil investigative demands, but for private plaintiffs the price of admission even to discovery, particularly to the sort of massive discovery at issue here, is to establish some basis for thinking the plaintiff -- the defendants have done something wrong. In that regard, in the Trinko case, the plaintiffs there specifically alleged that the defendants were engaged in actions against self interest by not cooperating with new entrants. And what the Court did is it went behind that mere allegation, looked at the complaint, looked at facts concerning the industry, looked at the statute, regulatory rulings and said that's ridiculous. Of course it is in the self interest of the incumbents to not go out of their way to cooperate with new entrants to allow them to take business away. Now the flip side, the second half of the conspiracy that the plaintiffs alleged here is our failure to enter new markets. And it's important to recognize that they are suggesting we should have relied upon a regulatory regime that we were successfully challenging in the courts. We got it struck down three separate times, and it was simply not a viable business opportunity in light of those facts and there is no reason to suggest that it was anything but in the self interest of the defendants to decline to enter these markets. Even conscious parallelism is not sufficient to state a claim under the antitrust laws. And at best, that is what we have here, and as a consequence they failed to state a claim. If the Court has further questions? I have nothing further.
05-1126 +++$+++ 34841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Kellogg. The case is submitted.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34845 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in 05-11284, Abdul-Kabir vs. Quarterman, and 05-11287, Brewer versus Quarterman. Mr. Owen.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34847 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When this Court granted review in mid October in these consolidated cases, the cases exemplified the Fifth Circuit's settled approach to reviewing claims of error under this Court's 1989 decision in Penry v. Lynaugh. In both cases the court below failed to take seriously the requirement that capital jurors have a meaningful basis for giving effect to the relevant mitigating qualities of a defendant's evidence, and in both cases the court below found as a factual matter, both against common sense and this Court's holdings, that reasonable jurors would regard evidence that a defendant had experienced significant mistreatment or abuse as a child or had mental impairments as an adult as reasons to find him less dangerous rather than more dangerous. But those opinions, however incorrect, no longer represent the Fifth Circuit's view of Penry. In mid December the Fifth Circuit decided in its en banc decision in Nelson vs. Quarterman to take a sharp turn away from its prior treatment of Penry claims and to follow instead this Court's guidance in Tennard and Smith. Under such circumstances, where the assumption that we imagine underlay this Court's decision to grant review in this case has been so profoundly changed by an intervening decision of the court below, we respectfully suggested by motion that the Court return these cases, vacate the judgments, return them to the Fifth Circuit for further consideration in light of the new opinion in Nelson.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34848 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why, when we are told that, that the State will surely challenge Nelson in this Court, and we already have the issue before us, so all that you would achieve is delay, just substituting the Nelson case for this one?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34849 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't believe, Your Honor, that, that all that would be accomplished by that would be certainly not just delay. I think that if the Court chooses to wait for the State's cert petition in Nelson, the Court could certainly put our cases aside and hold them awaiting Nelson -- Nelson's cert petition should be filed by mid March -- and then could make its judgment about whether to grant cert in Nelson or not. If it granted cert in Nelson it could decide the three cases together; if it found Nelson raised no questions that were worthy of review, it could either proceed to decide these cases or send them back to the Fifth Circuit. I think that the State's decision, though, Your Honor, is based on a, a misreading of Nelson. I think that the State has suggested to the Court that Nelson is in the State's phrase a narrow fact-based decision and I think that's not, I think that's not a fair characterization of the Nelson --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34850 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, why can't we just read Nelson and then say in these cases whether or not it's correct?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34851 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think the main reason, Your Honor, is that these cases aren't Nelson, and that Nelson if it presents issues that are worthy of the Court's consideration, that would be the better vehicle, rather than trying to use in effect these cases to decide issues that are presented by a different set of facts.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34852 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If these cases aren't Nelson that's a reason why we should decide these cases; it seems to me.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34853 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I am, I am confident that if the Court chooses to proceed on the merits of this case that we will prevail on the merits, until it finds --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34854 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, why don't you try to convince us of that?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34855 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then let me turn, let me turn to our, our merits, Your Honor. The issue before the Court in this case as we said is whether the jury instructions gave the jurors a meaningful basis for considering the relevant mitigating qualities of these two Defendants' mitigating evidence. In Mr. Brewer's case that included the fact that he was hospitalized for treatment for a major episode of depression about three months before the murder, and the fact that the evidence indicated he had suffered serious abuse, serious physical and emotional abuse from his father as a teenager. In Mr. Cole's case the evidence indicated that as a result of neglect and deprivation that he suffered as a child, he had himself emotional problems, fragmented personality, chronic depression, enormous need for nurturance, a lot of emotional turmoil and problems that continued into adulthood. And in addition to that, the expert who testified at Mr. Cole's trial indicated that he had been given a set of generally accepted neuropsychological tests and that on those tests he had scored below normal and on some of them very far below normal, under the fifth percentile. And as a result that he probably suffers from some sort of central nervous dysfunction which limits his impulse control. We respectfully suggest that under this Court's decision in Penry, those are all the kinds of facts about these two Defendants that could reasonably support a juror in concluding that a life sentence rather than the death penalty was an appropriate sentence. But because the jurors were never asked whether the mitigating evidence reduced the Defendant's culpability in such a way as to call for a life sentence, the resulting death sentences are unreliable. The jurors are asked only two questions as the Court well knows. But just to review, under the pre-1991 Texas statute jurors were only asked two questions: Was the crime committed deliberately and is the Defendant likely to pose a continuing threat to society? And those instructions alone as has been mentioned earlier this morning, don't mention mitigating evidence; the verdict form doesn't mention mitigating evidence; and so this Court has held repeatedly that whether that two question format satisfies the Eighth Amendment's individualized sentencing requirement is a matter of the evidence that's presented in a particular case, how it's argued to the jury, and what are the jurors told about the meaning of their instruction. And we believe that in this case, throughout the trial -- in both of these cases, excuse me -- throughout the trials the jurors were emphatically told that they were not entitled in deciding the future dangers test question to engage in any sort of broad inquiry into these Defendants' moral culpability. Instead, the prosecutors in both cases made very clear to the jurors during jury selection that in answering the future dangerousness question you must put to one side your opinion about whether the Defendant's background, for example, calls for a particular sentence and answer the question solely on, as the prosecutor put it, the basis of the facts. And we feel that the evidence in this case very strongly would have supported the inference that these, both of these Defendants were likely to be dangerous --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34856 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How would you compare that evidence with the evidence in Penry itself?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34857 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think, Your Honor --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34858 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ These are closer cases than Penry, I think. You'd have to concede that, wouldn't you?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34859 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think they are different cases, Your Honor, I'm not willing to concede that they are closer cases. I think that in, in the juror's mind, the only conclusion that could be drawn from the evidence in these cases is that the Defendants are likely to be dangerous in the future. That is exactly the same conclusion that would have been compelled by the evidence in Penry. I think that --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34860 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How does that, if the evidence, suppose we think the evidence is weaker, it's still evidence of childhood abuse and mental disorder of some kind, and those are relevant mitigating factors.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34861 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely. Absolutely, Your Honor,.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34862 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you -- if your case is less strong than maybe the jury will decide it the other way. But it doesn't mean that those factors are not mitigating factors.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34863 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I couldn't agree more, Your Honor. I think it's very clearly settled by Tennard and other cases going back to 1976 that facts like a deprived or abused background or mental impairment are certainly mitigating. And with further response to your --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34864 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Tennard, Tennard was decided after the State decision here, wasn't it?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34865 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This Court's decision in Tennard postdates the State court decisions in both of these cases. Yes, Your Honor.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34866 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And where is -- this is an AEDPA case, isn't it?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34867 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34868 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So we're, we're asking whether this State court made an unreasonable decision at the time, and at the time regardless of what the Fifth Circuit has now said, at the time under Johnson, and -- and there is another earlier case, we said that you didn't have to give full mitigating effects; as long as there was some manner in which mitigating effect could be given that was enough.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34869 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Court has been consistent --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34870 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So I think Tennard is utterly irrelevant even if it is right.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34871 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I, I -- I don't agree. And here's why, Your Honor. Tennard was itself both a habeas case and a case governed by the antiterrorism act, like these two cases. And so in Tennard the Court was called on to decide not squarely the question of whether the State court decision in that case had been objectively unreasonable, but whether a reasonable jurist could have found it to be objectively unreasonable such that a certificate of appealability was warranted. Mr. Tennard's case was decided by the State court in 1997, so I think it is immanent in this Court's ruling in Tennard that at least as of 1997, it was apparent that a, a low IQ score alone implicated the concerns of Penry.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34872 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Did Tennard purport to overrule Smith, even when it came down? It simply, it simply quoted language of the Justice O'Connor's concurrence in an earlier case. It certainly didn't purport to overrule Smith?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34873 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I, I see where Your Honor is --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34874 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry, Johnson, not Smith.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34875 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. And I, and I -- no, it didn't purport to overrule Johnson. And the reason why is this: I think the concept that ties this Court's cases together on Penry is this concept of meaningful consideration. Because Your Honor focused on one bit of language from Johnson: the jury has to be able to give some effect. Elsewhere in the Johnson opinion the Court said there has to be a meaningful basis for giving effect to the relevant mitigating qualities of the evidence. And I think neither of those two phrases can be read out of the context of the other. In other words, it can't just be some imaginable, conceivable, strained effect. It has to be some effect which speaks sensibly to the way that a juror would -- would understand the evidence to relate to future dangerousness. In the Johnson case, the defendant's evidence was his chronological youth, and I believe that it was, it is sensible for the Court to find that a reasonable juror could conclude that, that its relevance to culpability and its relevance to future dangerousness are essentially coextensive. This case is not like that.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34876 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In Brewer --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34877 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in Johnson wasn't there also --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34878 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Go ahead.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34879 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wasn't there also mitigating evidence about a troubled, about his troubled youth, which is analogous to what was involved at least -- well in both of these cases?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34880 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Very little such evidence, Your Honor, in Mr. Johnson's case. And in that case moreover this Court's question presented, the question on which it granted review, was limited to the question of age, so this Court didn't reach or decide in Johnson the question of whether the other facts about Johnson's background that found their way before the jury might have been within the jurors' effective reach. And I do think that the specific evidence in Johnson again was argued as a basis for a finding of nondangerousness, of rehabilitatability. That's utterly untrue of evidence in Mr. Brewer's case and Mr. Cole's case, where I think it's very clear that the evidence is being offered to provide some kind of explanation for the jurors about what caused these men to commit these terrible crimes, not that --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34881 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But in, in Brewer's case, it's, quoting the record, evidence of one hospitalization for a single episode of nonpsychotic major depression. So it was certainly opened for a jury to determine that as mitigating and not aggravating in assessing the likelihood that there was going to be further violent behavior.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34882 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think, Your Honor --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34883 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Quite a bit different than Penry.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34884 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think that you can separate the diagnosis of depression, that, even that one single episode of hospitalization for depression, from what the jury knew about Mr. Brewer's upbringing, from the fact that they knew he had been hit by his father in the terms of, his mother said, numerous times. He was struck with the butt of a pistol, he was hit with a flashlight, he was hit with a stick of firewood. His father told him if you ever raise your hand to me you better kill me, because I'll kill you. He saw his father bloody his mother, and bruise her eyes, throw chairs at her.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34885 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And your submission -- your submission is that every juror is, or a reasonable juror is going to look at that, and the only conclusion that they are going to draw is that he is more likely to be violent in the future? As opposed to the conclusion that there is mitigating evidence because of this, that he should -- mercy should be shown to him in light of all of this? And I just don't see how you can speculate which way the jury is going to go.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34886 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that it's not simply speculation, Your Honor, I think this Court recognized in Tennard as it did in Penry, that when there is evidence of mental impairment before the jury, there is at least the probable inference of dangerousness. The amici before the court, both the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, on the one hand, the Child Welfare League of America, on the other, their amicus briefs I think really -- really detailed the fact that this is a commonplace understanding in our society. And the reason that we know that, Your Honor, is what the prosecutor said in his closing argument, where he said to the jury if you take a puppy and you beat that puppy, then he is going to bite and he is going to bite as long as he lives. There is nothing you can do to change that. I think that where you have --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34887 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that was in, in Brewer. Now --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34888 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34889 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- there was no reliance or no similar statement by the prosecutor in Abdul-Kabir or Mr. Cole's case.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34890 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There was no similar --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34891 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So do we have different results in these two consolidated cases?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34892 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. I think that this Court's case in -- decision in Tennard, when it's talking about the inference of probable future dangerousness, this Court says: The jurors might well have believed that Mr. Tennard would be dangerous in the future, both as an inference to be drawn from the evidence and because the prosecutor expressly told them that's how they ought to regard the evidence. And in this case we have the prosecutor, in Mr. Brewer's case we have the prosecutor expressly telling the jury, just as the prosecutor did in Mr. Tennard's case, what is mitigating about the guy's background --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34893 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So the, so the -- but my point is the absence of a similar prosecutorial statement in the Cole case cuts against you.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34894 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It simply doesn't cut as far in favor of us, Your Honor. The fact that in Tennard this Court said that from mental impairment, a probable inference of dangerousness may be drawn, cuts squarely in our favor. And you don't even have to go to the level of inference. In Mr. Cole's case his expert witnesses said that the background experiences that this young man had make him dangerous. And they, they could not forecast exactly how long it might be before he would conceivably age out of that. But they said is it 10 years? It could be 15 years, it could be 20 years. I mean, there is just -- that doesn't give a reasonable juror, as -- if all you ask the juror is, after they have heard that evidence is, is there a probability that this guy is going to be dangerous in the future? I think they would be compelled to say yes, even though they might say, if they were broadly instructed --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34895 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where is evidence of abatement in that case that was before the jury? So that if you ask them, was it this person's fault in some moral sense, that might affect whether they wish to show mercy? And if you ask them whether he is going to grow out of it, they may well say, it was not his fault because of this brain disorder and he is going to grow out of it and that was the evidence, and so we are not going to sentence him to death.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34896 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that it's not unconceivable that a juror could have reasoned in that fashion. But I think it's not reasonably possible. I think that this Court's decisions in Penry and Tennard suggest that a juror's commonsensical response to evidence that a defendant has, presently poses a grave danger as a result of his life experiences and the enduring impacts that they have left upon him, the reasonable response of a juror shown such evidence is to find future dangerousness, and that that is precisely the problem with the pre-1991 Texas sentencing statute. If we had a broad mitigating evidence issue like the one that's presently given to Texas juries then we could all be confident that the jury had engaged in precisely the reasoning that the Court -- that the Court is hypothesizing. That they looked at the evidence and said yes, he's dangerous, but he's also deserving of something less than death so we will accomplish that by answering this issue in a certain way.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34897 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But in Penry we didn't establish a per se rule. We said it depends upon the evidence. It depends upon the instructions. It depends upon what the prosecutors say. It seems to me that you're arguing for an absolute rule.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34898 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't -- no, Your Honor, and don't let me, please don't let me be misunderstood. I do not believe that this is a per se rule. I think Johnson stands with our case. I think that Graham stands with our case. I think there's no -- there's no need for the Court to -- to change anything other than to -- and it doesn't have to change anything about its existing approach to Penry for our clients to prevail. Because I think that if the Court looks at this evidence and concludes that a reasonable juror approaching this, there's no reasonable probability that they would have felt constrained to find him to be a future danger, then we lose. But I don't think you can look at this record and see that.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34899 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's not no reasonable probability, that's not the standard. The standard under Smith is whether the juries can consider this mitigating evidence in some manner.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34900 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think, Your Honor, that again, removing that language from Smith, from the language in -- if you're talking about Johnson, I know you're referring to Johnson, that the language in Johnson about some effect can't be separated from the language about meaningful effect.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34901 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's absolutely one step removed from that.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34902 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry, Your Honor?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34903 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I say the actual question is even one step removed. It's whether it is unreasonable to conclude otherwise than what you conclude, which is wrong.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34904 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. And I think --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34905 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But unreasonable.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34906 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, and I think that it is unreasonable. I think the State court in this case had essentially two lines of authority, that it was trying to decide which one controlled this case. It had Penry which involved evidence of mental impairment and child abuse, and it had Johnson and Graham which involved evidence of youth and other background. And I think that the facts of these cases, given the facts of these two cases, it is objectively unreasonable to say they fit over here with Johnson and Graham rather than they fit over here with Penry. And that's why I think the decisions by the State courts are not just wrong, but objectively unreasonable. If the court has no further questions, I will reserve the remainder of my time.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34907 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Owen. Mr. Marshall.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34909 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: When the State court considered these Penry claims in 1994, 1999 and January 2001, this Court's decisions in Graham and Johnson made it clear that the Eighth Amendment requires only that a jury be only able to consider mitigating evidence in some manner, not in every conceivable manner. This is because virtually any mitigating evidence may be viewed as relevant to moral culpability apart from its relevance to these Texas special issues. Cole and Brewer with sizzling bright IQ scores of 121 and 115, dysfunctional childhoods and depression, are much more like the troubled childhood and youth evidence in Graham and Johnson than the mental retardation, brain damage and severe child abuse evidence in Penry. Equating these facts to Penry --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34910 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's the same kind of evidence. It may be weaker. In other words, it's not evidence of good deeds in the community. It's two specific kinds of evidence, the very kinds of evidence that were involved in Penry. You can argue about whether this was weaker, but it's certainly different from youth and reputation for good character.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34911 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I disagree, Your Honor. In Graham in particular, the Court was not just considering youth, the Court was considering a troubled childhood, a difficult childhood in which Graham's mother had been hospitalized with a mental illness, his custody shifted from relative to relative. That's exactly the same kind of evidence we have in Cole.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34912 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the evidence was that he didn't react hostilely, he didn't do bad deeds. On the contrary, he was gentle, kind, God fearing, and that's why the jury should regard the murder as aberrational. That was the Graham picture, whereas here we're dealing with people who are dangerous.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34913 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, that's not the way counsel argued it to the jury in either case. In both of these cases defense counsel presented his case to the jury during -- through his evidence and his argument, that this was youthful indiscretion or it was an aberration, and it wouldn't happen again, which is exactly what Graham --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34914 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What other choice does defense counsel have, given that the jury is going to get a question, is this man likely to be a danger in the future? What else could counsel argue?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34915 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, that's not the question before the Court. The question before the Court is whether the Eighth Amendment was violated and whether the jury had a reasonable opportunity, and in --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34916 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. Well, maybe sending counsel into those two questions, what violates the Eighth Amendment instead of doing what Texas now does and say jury mitigating evidence is for you to judge. We're not going to bottle it up inside of two special questions.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34917 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, that's not the question before the Court, though. We're trying to determine in this case whether the State courts unreasonably determined that these juries had a fair opportunity to consider that evidence. And I think looking at argument, when we're determining the reasonableness of that decision, looking at counsel's argument is all we have to go on in determining whether the jury had a fair shot. Now I think if you look back at the '90s --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34918 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But realistically, a defense counsel who knows that the jury is going to have those two questions, he's got to fit his argument to the jury into those questions.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34919 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, that was a strategic choice, though. This is not a Sixth Amendment claim. We're looking at the Eighth Amendment now. And so what counsel chose to do is not the question. We're looking at what he did, and we've got this record to work with.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34920 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're looking at what Texas law forced him to do.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34921 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think that's the issue before the Court, Your Honor. I think what we're looking at is whether he -- the jury had a fair opportunity here, regardless of what counsel chose not to do or what the statute forced him to do. The fact is when the State courts looked at these claims in 1994 and 1999, this evidence was much more like Graham than it was like Penry, and it was reasonable for them to decide that there was no Penry error in these cases because of that fact. And I think it's worth mentioning that if that's not the case, then I think we've arrived at the point where Penry has swallowed the rule announced in Jurek 31 years ago and it -- to which it was only supposed to be an exception.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34922 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Jurek was a facial challenge, and the Court said no, on its face we can see that there are things that would fit into it. Good character would fit into it. But Jurek said as applied, we're not certainly not ruling on that. All we're saying is it doesn't fall on its face, and then as cases come up the law is filled out. But Jurek doesn't say -- Jurek didn't say across the board, it's enough that there are these two special factors, that everything can be squeezed into them, all mitigating evidence one way or another can be squeezed into them.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34923 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is correct, Your Honor. Jurek was a facial challenge. But in Johnson and Graham the Court made it pretty clear, I think, that as long as the evidence is relevant in some way within those special issues, some mitigating way --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34924 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought in Johnson the only question presented was age.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34925 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In Johnson, Your Honor?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34926 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34927 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Youth was the central point of Johnson, but Graham involved youth and a distinctly troubled childhood, much like we have in these cases. And so if that evidence was relevant within future dangerousness and did not amount to Eighth Amendment error, then this evidence has to be just as relevant. And in fact we have another layer of analysis on top of this because we are looking at the State court's decision under AEDPA.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34928 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't see how this fits in the Graham package. The Graham is, this child came from a deprived background but managed to survive it, and he fits right into the category, he's not dangerous. Look at all the bad things that were done to him. He turns out not to be dangerous. Apart from this one murder, he's been a good boy. That's not the picture in either of these cases.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34929 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's essentially the picture, Justice Ginsburg, in Brewer. That's exactly the way counsel presented it to the jury. But not only did counsel argue that he wasn't going to be dangerous despite his childhood shortcomings, there was a deliberateness definition submitted in the Brewer case, which is what this Court suggested in Penry in 1989 might remedy this problem. And so the court submitted a definition of deliberateness and counsel argued it to the jury, that -- the definition was read to the jury, counsel argued --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34930 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where is that charge?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34931 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It appears at page 90 of the joint appendix, Your Honor, and that's the Brewer joint appendix. Now counsel read that definition to the jury, and the definition reads as follows: "A manner of doing an act characterized by or resulting from careful and thorough consideration characterized by awareness of the consequences, willful, slow, unhurried and steady, as though allowing time for a decision." Now counsel read that definition to the jury during his closing argument. He argued that Brewer's crime reflected poor planning and execution, that he was led into it by other actors, by his girlfriend Christy Nystrom, and that his commitment to a mental hospital and his mental illness, depression in this case, were argued specifically as cause for those faults. And so counsel related the evidence within that deliberateness instruction to the jury, and that provided them with a significant vehicle to give effect to this evidence.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34932 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that what the Penry Court was talking about, something like what you just read?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34933 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think so, Your Honor, and the Penry Court was not specific about what that definition should say, but this is certainly helpful to the jury in this case and in taking account some of this evidence that was before it.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34934 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you see, in Johnson the Court was confronted with the special issues and it makes the assumption based on the State's representation there, that the special issues had enough latitude for a jury to fully consider this. What has happened in these cases is that the prosecutors tell the jury, they keep reminding the jury you just must answer special issues one and two as given. And in the Cole case they say, even though you felt maybe he had had a rough time as a kid, you still must put that out of the mind, of your mind, and just go by the special issues. And that's the concern in these cases.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34935 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That may be a concern, Justice Kennedy, but the Cole case provides a particular example of how defense counsel countered that argument. 75 percent of his argument, which is between pages 141 and 144 of the Cole joint appendix, 75 percent of that argument is that Cole will burn out as he grows older, and that's based on the testimony of his experts. And he says that burnout, that likeliness that he will not be dangerous is a reasonable one.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34936 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that's because the issues confined him to that.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34937 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor, but that's a legitimate argument on the evidence here, and I think that it would be, it's difficult in my mind anyway to determine that the State court in reading Graham and Johnson could unreasonably determine that that wasn't a good vehicle for the jury when he said, you have a reasonable doubt about this man's dangerousness because of the testimony that we presented to you from his experts that said he wouldn't be dangerous in the future.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34938 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He's 30 years old, and the testimony is 40, 50. It says, jury, for 10 years this man is going to be walking in prison corridors and he's going to be a danger for at least 10 years. And that's an effective --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34939 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, that's easily as effective as the -- as youth was in Graham and Johnson. Youth is evidence that -- I mean, we don't know how long it takes people to grow out of youth, but certainly 10 years wouldn't be unreasonable under the circumstances in that case. And so I don't see any difference between youth and burnout in this context. We are talking about a finite amount of time, we don't know exactly what that amount of time is, but it's certainly reasonable for a jury to give mitigating effect to it under that question.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34940 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Marshall, I heard what you read from this charge, and I don't have the exact words of what the Court was talking about in Penry, but it did say a special instruction that would enable the jury who believed Penry committed the crime deliberately, that he committed it deliberately, not slowly, whatever you just read, but also believed that his background and diminished mental capacity diminished his moral culpability, making the imposition of the death sentence unwarranted. So what Penry said very clearly is yes, it's deliberate, but you give them a charge that tells them even though it was deliberate, because of his abuse, because of his retardation, he is not morally culpable to the same extent as someone who doesn't have those impairments. That's the instruction that Penry said could be given and that would be okay under the deliberateness. Quite different from the instruction you read.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34941 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's different, Your Honor, but I don't think it's that much different, and the reason is that this makes the crime a function of awareness of the consequences of slow unhurried consideration of those consequences. And then counsel argues to the jury that Brewer is uncapable of engaging in that sort of premeditation because of his mental problems, and so that's what reduces his culpability under the circumstances. And I think if you combine the argument and the definition, which we were bound to do under Boyde versus California, we're supposed to look at the entire context of the trial here, that that meets that suggestion in Penry for it. It's not exactly what the Court suggested.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34942 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Wasn't there something about moral culpability in what you read?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34943 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. It's not mentioned in this definition.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34944 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's what Penry makes clear, makes the distinction, between these are factors that don't say he is that dangerous, don't say he didn't act deliberately, but they reduce or the jury may decide that they reduce his moral culpability. And that's not what this charge was?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34945 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This charge is different and you're correct in that, Justice Ginsburg. However, future dangerousness also provides that vehicle in this case, just the same as it did in Graham, and so -- and in Johnson. The Court said that this kind of evidence, the evidence of a troubled childhood, could find effect within future dangerousness in some manner. And granted we can conceive of other ways it might be relevant to culpability, but the Court explained -- and this was what the State court was working with at the time it considered this claim -- this Court explained that just because we can imagine other ways in which it might be relevant doesn't mean that we have got Eighth Amendment error. It's just important that the jury had some way of getting to it. And I don't see how this is markedly different than the evidence that the Court said fit within future dangerousness in Graham. Now, in -- I think another thing that I need to mention about Cole is, is that my colleague noted the expert testimony that Cole lacked impulse control. Now, I think the, the mitigating nature of that testimony in this case becomes especially apparent when you realize that, that Cole planned this crime 2 days in advance. He planned to strangle this 66-year-old blind man 2 days before he did it. And so I don't think that an impulse control problem mitigates his culpability for this crime in any way and I don't think any reasonable juror would ever see that. So I think that the mitigating significance of that evidence in this case is severely diminished as opposed to the testimony that the jury heard in Penry, for example, which is that he'll never learn from his mistakes, he had previously committed a rape, he didn't learn from it; this time he committed a murder and a rape. And so the mitigating relevance of that evidence was only aggravating within future dangerousness.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34946 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How do we, how does that factor in on the issues that are before us, the weakness of the mitigating evidence? In what way are we supposed to assess it? We don't have a harmless error question in these cases.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34947 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is no harmless error question, correct, Mr. Chief Justice. However, I think when we're looking at the Boyde standard, which is -- and in Johnson -- a reasonable likelihood that the jury was precluded from giving effect to the evidence, the reasonableness of that likelihood, the reasonableness of that possibility, depends upon the way the juror, the jury, heard the evidence and the relative strength of that evidence. And so evidence of intoxication, for example, while it does mitigate culpability in some manner, would not create the reasonable possibility of Eighth Amendment error in that sense.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34948 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So your argument is that the mitigating evidence was not precluded by, reasonable consideration was not precluded by the instruction; it was precluded by the fact that there wasn't much mitigating evidence to begin with?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34949 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor. But in addition to all of that, the State court was looking at Penry and Graham when they decided this case and there was no Penry II yet. There was no Tennard or Smith. And so it was reasonable for them to compare the evidence, the weight of that evidence, the strength of that evidence, to those cases and decide that it fell on the Graham and Johnson side of the line rather than the Penry side of the line. That's the only thing they could do at the time.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34950 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, do you think the case should have been decided differently should it have been decided after those decisions?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34951 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Stevens, if we take into account the full effect language that gets quoted in Penry II, we might well have a different result. But that wasn't the standard at the time and under AEDPA --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34952 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But those decisions didn't purport to change the law.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34953 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, under Teague they did not purport to change the law. But I think AEDPA is a different inquiry here. We're looking at what clearly established law was at the time the State courts made their decisions and not necessarily what, you know, what the Teague inquiry would be. And so at that point I think it's pretty clear under Graham and Johnson we're looking at some effect. Whatever "full effect" means now, it doesn't apply to these cases. And I think that gets to the main point here. We're looking at an exceedingly ordinary fact pattern in a capital murder case in both of these cases: Dysfunctional childhoods, a small amount of abuse in Brewer, undescribed --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34954 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Am I correct, your position essentially is that, while it may well be true that these instructions did not permit the jury to give full effect to this mitigating evidence, that was not clearly established law at the time of these decisions?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34955 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Justice Stevens.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34956 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's your view.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34957 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Were these decisions post-Johnson.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34958 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. In fact, the Brewer case was decided the year after Johnson and the, the Cole case was decided in 1999. So the Court had not held forth on what Penry meant in a long time at that point. Graham and Johnson were the last clear statements the Court had made. Now, I want to correct one misstatement by my opposing counsel in Brewer. Brewer was -- there are three distinct episodes of abuse that appear in the record in that case: That he was struck with a pistol by his father, he was struck with his fist, and struck with a flashlight. He was never struck with a stick of firewood, and that's on page 65 of the joint appendix. That's pretty clear. This isolated abuse that occurred late in life -- we don't know the exact time frame, but it could be as late as age 18 or 19 -- surely has different characteristics in a jury's eyes than the evidence in Penry which, in which the defendant was beat and beat severely from a very young age, from his infancy, and that beating, that abuse, caused brain damage or mental retardation. The ordinary nature of this evidence in comparison to the exceptional --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34959 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are you suggesting that some kind of a psychological expert would say that abuse as an adolescent is not as damaging as abuse as a young child?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34960 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not suggesting that, Your Honor. I'm just suggesting that this is a smaller amount of abuse than what was in Penry.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34961 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I guess striking a big person is not quite as bad as striking a little person.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34962 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That may be true, Your Honor.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34963 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the question is one of the evidence was weak, why isn't that a harmless error question rather than a question of whether the jury can give it effect?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34964 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there is, there is that reasonable likelihood standard built in under Boyde.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34965 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The likelihood of?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34966 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of constitutional error.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34967 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, constitutional error is --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34968 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is the reasonable likelihood --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34969 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34970 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Reasonable likelihood that the juror was precluded from considering the relevant mitigating evidence.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34971 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. So if the evidence is very weak and if the instructions prevent you from considering it, then it's precluded. But if the evidence is very weak it didn't matter.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34972 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think it's a reasonable reading of Graham and Johnson, though, Your Honor, that weak evidence does fit within these special issues. That's what those cases held. They said the jury could consider the evidence in some manner and therefore there was no reasonable likelihood that they were precluded from doing so.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34973 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So imagine you're a juror and you think to yourself, I see all this stuff about the childhood, frankly it doesn't move me so far as his dangerousness, I think he's dangerous, and I also think he did it deliberately. And then you think to yourself, well, could I consider it because it shows a bad childhood and that is deserving of a life term? I'm not sure it shows me that, but can I consider it for that purpose at all? What's my answer under Texas law?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34974 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, the State court considering this case was looking at Graham, in which the Court Stated that that evidence fit within future dangerousness.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34975 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. I have gotten -- I've finished considering it for future dangerousness. No, it doesn't move me; he's dangerous. Now I say to myself, can I consider it for the purpose of showing a bad childhood deserving of mercy, if you like? Can I consider it for that purpose? What's the answer under State law?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34976 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34977 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The answer is no.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34978 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Justice Breyer, the answer is yes.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34979 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The answer is yes?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34980 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The answer is yes because this Court said it was yes. This Court said that in Graham the jury was free to accept counsel's suggestion that Graham's conduct was merely an aberration and that, and that he wouldn't do it again. That's exactly the way the case was argued to the jury by these two defense lawyers.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34981 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not talking about future dangerousness. I'm talking about -- I would be repeating myself. You've taken that, I'm not talking about future dangerousness. The jury's decided that matter in your favor. I'm saying does Texas law allow -- you understood what I said, didn't you?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34982 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, yes.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34983 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right, and the answer is yes, you can take it in to show mercy?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34984 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34985 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what's the Texas case that says that?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34986 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, it's not a Texas case. It's this court in Graham and Johnson. This Court said that evidence of a troubled childhood, of the particular dysfunction that comes with youth, can be taken as an aberration, that the person will not repeat --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34987 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, did we say that in the case of all childhood, in cases, in every case of childhood abuse and so forth?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34988 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The question is --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34989 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Or was it really applied just in the context of the Graham evidence?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34990 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, in these cases it's relevant for the same reasons it was in Graham. This evidence is not enough like Penry to warrant relief.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34991 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. But the answer to Justice Breyer it seems to me has to be that you can only consider it in the, in the context of deliberateness or future dangerousness.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34992 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34993 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that depends on the nature of the evidence, I take it? I mean, if the evidence we were talking about was biological predisposition to violence, that's only going to point in one direction, right? I mean, if the evidence is isolated incident, incidents of depression, the idea is that, well, a juror might look at that and say, well, that's why he did it, and that since it was isolated it's not likely to come up again and therefore it can be regarded as mitigating as well as aggravating.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34994 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Mr. Chief Justice.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34995 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And so when you get into this evidence of child abuse, I mean, how are we supposed to decide if the evidence is sufficient so that anyone looking at it is going to say, he's only going to do it again, or if someone who's looking at it is going to say, well, there's an excuse for it and he's going to outgrow it? Do we make that determination in every case based on the particular evidence and the particular arguments that counsel made?
05-11284 +++$+++ 34996 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think there's any other way to do it, Mr. Chief Justice. This Court has continually engaged in a case-specific analysis on a case-by-case basis in these types, when granting these types of claims. If the Court has no further questions --
05-11284 +++$+++ 34997 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Unless you take the view that Penry took, which is you have to let the jury distinguish between dangerousness and deliberate conduct on the one hand and mitigation for mercy purposes that don't tie in at all to dangerousness.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34998 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's because, Justice Ginsburg, the Penry's evidence was relevant only in an aggravating way to those issues. It suggested nothing other than the fact that he would be a future danger, and when the evidence is not so aggravating, when the evidence suggests, suggests that there is a mitigating answer to the future dangerousness question, that the person won't be a future danger because they're going to burn out or because this is an isolated incident, we have a different situation.
05-11284 +++$+++ 34999 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can you tell me, if you know, how many cases in the Texas system, capital cases, are pending that were decided before the legislature amended the instruction?
05-11284 +++$+++ 35000 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, there are 47 inmates on Texas death row that were sentenced under this statute that remain there. There are nine cases which have litigated Penry claims all the way to conclusion in Federal court. There are 25 more that are somewhere in the pipeline either in State court or Federal court. I've actually looked at the cases and 17 of those cases, 17 of the 34 that are still in the system, have evidence that's almost identical to these cases.
05-11284 +++$+++ 35001 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that wasn't the question. Your question was how many were before or after the --
05-11284 +++$+++ 35002 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I take it your answer was that all these were tried before Texas amended the statute. Was it 1991 when it amended the statute?
05-11284 +++$+++ 35003 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-11284 +++$+++ 35004 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And all the cases you mentioned were tried before 1991.
05-11284 +++$+++ 35005 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MARSHALL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. 47. 47 cases were sentenced under this pre-1991 statute. If the Court has no further questions, I'd ask that they affirm the judgment of the court below.
05-11284 +++$+++ 35006 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Marshall. You Mr. Owen, have you 12 minutes remaining.
05-11284 +++$+++ 35008 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'd like to make two points about Graham since it's been a subject of some discussion. First is to remind the Court that Graham was a Teague case. Graham was a case about whether the law in 1984, prior to Penry -- Mr. Graham's case became final on direct appeal -- dictated the result that he was asking for, which I think doesn't mean it has no persuasive impact on these cases, but I certainly think it limits its precedential value outside the scope of the question of youth that Johnson later settled squarely. The second thing I want to say about Graham is this is the State's brief in Graham, 91-7580, and I want to just note that at page 26, squarely. This is the State's brief in Graham 917580 and I want to note at page 26, footnote 8 the State says the insubstantiality of Graham's evidence of a troubled childhood is readily apparent, which certainly suggests that there is a fair reading of the evidence in Graham of this background evidence as not being substantial, not being evidence about abuse or mistreatment. The fact that he was moved from one relative to another because of the circumstances in his family, in that case was not shown to have any negative impact on him. Whereas I think in Mr. Cole's case certainly there is expert testimony that it had a very devastating negative impact on him. So Graham really does not even give the Court much guidance on the question of troubled background because there is no indication that Graham actually had a, a background of mistreatment. By the same token with respect to the State's comment or my brother's comment that the, the record doesn't bear out that Mr. Brewer was struck by his father with a stick of firewood, that is correct. What the record actually says is, if I may quote from the Brewer JA at page 90 -- 95 -- 65, excuse me: "He tried to hit him with a stick of firewood. When he went outside to grab the firewood I --" -- that's Mr. Brewer's mother -- "slammed the front door and locked it, and he smashed the glass out of the front door with the firewood. That was the night I had him arrested."
05-11284 +++$+++ 35009 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How old was Brewer at that time?
05-11284 +++$+++ 35010 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe he was 15, Your Honor. But I also want to, I also want to emphasize that I think there, the fact is, the testimony is that Mr. Brewer was hit numerous times. That's his mom's word. Hit with objects only twice, but hit numerous times. And I don't think the Court should also underestimate the significance of the evidence that Mr. Brewer saw his father brutalize his mother on many occasions, because that evidence too contributes. It's not just the difference between being hit and watching someone else being hit. I think everyone understands that there are enduring feelings of shame and guilt, and that the teenage son feels --
05-11284 +++$+++ 35011 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the argument is that the jury hearing this evidence in light of all the instructions will only conclude that the evidence shows that he will be violent again. They will not feel that they can take it into account in any way to determine that it's a situation in which they should extend mercy, or that, I guess it was, I get the Cole and the Brewer records confused here, but that this, the cause for the violence will abate with, with age.
05-11284 +++$+++ 35012 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think, Your Honor --
05-11284 +++$+++ 35013 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or that in, I guess in Brewer's case in particular, that since the violence was caused by a particular bout of depression, that would not necessarily recur.
05-11284 +++$+++ 35014 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I, I don't think that's -- that's not our argument, first, Your Honor, for this reason. The court's question was, as I understand it, don't we have to show there is no way the jury could have understood this evidence except as aggravating? I don't think that's, I don't think that's the test. In Tennard this Court said if the jury might well have considered the evidence as aggravating, then --
05-11284 +++$+++ 35015 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that was after -- I guess the question would be under Johnson, whether or not it could be considered in some manner.
05-11284 +++$+++ 35016 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. OWEN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In some manner that is reasonable and that gives effect to the relevant mitigating qualities of the evidence. Yes, Your Honor. And I do think that the, that the fact of Mr. Brewer's -- the fact that the jury knew that he had endured this mistreatment as a teenager could only have been given aggravating effect. I don't think there is any way to reason from the premise that he was mistreated physically and emotionally by his father when he was a teenager, to the conclusion that therefore he will be less dangerous in the future. That doesn't seem to me to be a reasonable connection. And I think that what the Court was calling for in Johnson was that there be some sensible link between the proffered mitigating evidence and these narrow questions, which as has been pointed out already were the only options for the jury in this case. There was no, there was no mercy option. There was no mitigation instruction. The jury was told solely these two -- these two special issues. With respect to the Brewer argument that there was a deliberateness instruction, I think Justice Ginsburg has it exactly right in observing that in Penry, what the Court said was that to satisfy the, you know, to fix the deficit in the former Texas special issues, a definition of deliberateness would have to direct the jury's attention to the defendant's personal culpability. And I don't think this instruction does that. This instruction directs them to the sort of quantity of forethought, how much did he think about it, how long did he think about it, did he mull it over? But I don't think that that captures the moral culpability aspect that Penry says is required under the Eighth Amendment. If the Court has further questions I'm happy to entertain them. Otherwise we would ask that the Court grant our motions. In the alternative we would ask that the Court reverse the judgments in both cases with directions to reinstate the District Court's favorable judgment in Mr. Brewer's case and to grant habeas relief in Mr. Cole's case. Thank you, Your Honor.
05-11284 +++$+++ 35017 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you Mr. Owen. The case is submitted.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35021 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument first this morning in 05-11304, Smith versus Texas. Mr. Steiker.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35023 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is here for the second time. In your summary of reversal, this Court held that Petitioner's mitigating evidence could not be given adequate consideration through the Texas special issues or the nullification instructions. On remand, the CCA found the error harmless by concluding the opposite, that Petitioner's jury could give sufficient consideration to his mitigating evidence, including specifically the evidence of his 78 IQ, learning disabilities and troubled background.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35024 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Did they find it could or did they find that it did? I thought our holding was that given the instructions, the jury would not necessarily take into account those mitigating factors, and I thought that what the Texas court held is, yes, that was a possibility, and we have to see whether that possibility came to pass, which is what harmless error analysis involves.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35025 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think, Justice Scalia, what the --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35026 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So they are not contradicting the fact that the jury wasn't required to take it into account, but they are saying nonetheless, in our view, the jury did take it into account, and therefore, the error was harmless. That doesn't contradict our opinion. I mean, you might want to argue against it on the merits, but I don't think that will contradict our opinion.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35027 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it does contradict your opinion, Justice Scalia. Your opinion said that Petitioner's mitigating evidence had little or nothing to do with the inquiries of the special issues, and your opinion also said that the nullification instruction, no matter how clearly conveyed or fully understood by the jury, would not solve that problem.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35028 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right. And that means that the jury was not instructed to take it into account. And I think the Texas court is conceding that. But it's, it's saying, nonetheless, we don't think that the error made any difference because, in our view, the jury did take it into account.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35029 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The matter in which the CCA posited that the jury could take it into account was the fact that on voir dire, the jurors said we can follow a nullification instruction and falsify our answers to the special issues in order to give effect to mitigating evidence. That was the exact same proposition that the CCA had issued in its first opinion that this Court summarily reversed.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35030 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but it seems to me it's one thing to use it for the purpose of saying the instruction was okay. And it's something else to use it for the purpose of saying even though the instruction didn't require that, it was a fuzzy instruction and a juror could very reasonably have understood it not to allow nullification, nonetheless, we have satisfied ourselves that the jury indeed thought it had the nullification power. I don't see how it contradicts our opinion.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35031 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think what's contradictory, Your Honor, is that the notion that the nullification instruction would be an adequate vehicle was what this Court specifically rejected.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35032 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They didn't say it was an adequate vehicle. I mean, they acknowledged that that instruction shouldn't be given again because it doesn't require the jury to do what, what you say the jury must do, and I think they accept that. They say, oh, no, I thought it was fuzzy, and didn't require -- we think the jury did indeed think it had the power to nullify.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35033 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I would also add that when you actually look at the voir dire on which the CCA relied in which it said jurors express no discomfort, no hesitation about their willingness to falsify their answers to the special issues, the very first juror in this case, a lawyer, expressed exactly the kinds of discomfort that this Court feared and anticipated with the use of the nullification instruction.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35034 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Mr. Steiker, may I interrupt you or interrupt the course of your argument to get to a more preliminary point before you get down to details? Do you concede that harmless error analysis is ever appropriate, is ever open as an option following an, in effect, a finding of this kind of instructional error, Penry I instructional error? Do you concede that?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35035 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Souter, we do not concede that, but nor do we rely on that as a basis for relief in this case. We believe that the purported harmless error analysis that the CCA applied was so interwoven with a rejection of the Federal constitutional --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35036 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I quite agree. I understand that. Was the, was the issue of the availability of harmless error raised on your side of the case in the proceedings back in Texas?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35037 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, it was. It was raised on remand from this Court.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35038 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Also on the same preliminary line of inquiry, are we in as good a position as the State court to conduct harmless error analysis, or can we or must we defer to the State court's harmless error analysis?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35039 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would say ordinarily this Court is not in as good a position as a State court to conduct harmless error analysis. Our belief here is that the, the basis for the State finding the error harmless was a very unusual rejection of the conclusion that this, these instructions would facilitate consideration of mitigating evidence.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35040 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You agree that the application of the harmless error analysis is a question of State law, though, correct?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35041 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I do not agree with that. I think that the application of harmless error analysis, when it's predicated on a misunderstanding of Federal constitutional law, is not an independent basis for decision. It's clearly wrapped up in the Federal claim, and I think this Court's cases have clearly so held.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35042 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that if there is an instruction given to the jury and it violates the Constitution, then we, as a de novo matter, can determine the harmless error, harmless error inquiry?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35043 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's, it's certainly possible. I don't think that that's a usual practice and I wouldn't advocate that here. And this is not a usual case in which the State has conducted an ordinary harmless error analysis. The State has actually in no way disparaged the power and extent of Petitioner's mitigating evidence.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35044 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, is the level of harmless error determined as a matter of Federal or State law when there is a Federal law?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35045 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Generally speaking, it's a matter of State law with some limitations.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35046 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Really. You mean that they could have something that it has to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and we'd be bound by that?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35047 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, on direct review, Chapman clearly says it's a Federal question what the standard of review may be. And on direct review, it's undoubted that a harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard is required by Chapman. This case doesn't present the issue on whether on State -- post-conviction, a State can have the latitude of requiring greater harm, because on the CCA's own analysis, the standard of harm that's applied on State habeas is identical to the standard of harm that's applied on direct review, the standard of Almanza, which posits Chapman error, harmless beyond a reasonable doubt for preserved error, and egregious harm for unpreserved error.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35048 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And, and this was unpreserved error. I mean, they are not saying this for everything. They are saying he did not object to the instructions at the time and therefore our harmless error standard is -- is more rigorous than it would otherwise be. What's unreasonable about that?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35049 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And we -- we argue that there are three independent bases, Federal bases for finding that the application of egregious harm in this case to be violative of Federal rights. And I'd like to turn to the first of those arguments. Petitioner plainly objected that the special issues and verdict form did not allow for consideration of his mitigating evidence. That was and remains his core argument throughout this case.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35050 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but that's a very generalized argument, and what he won on was a very specific point that, that this instruction in effect required, if they were going to give mitigating effect, required a jury nullification. That's a very specific point.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35051 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ On that --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35052 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He did not object -- he did not object to that specific problem. Had he objected, the court would have said, you know, there is something to what you say, and I'll give a different instruction. But he didn't.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35053 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Everyone at trial understood that the special issues on the verdict form were unalterable, that Texas law required the legislature to specify what was on the special verdict form. What the trial court invited counsel to do was to offer a different form of nullification in the supplemental instruction that would then interpret the special issues. This Court's opinion in its summary reversal made plain that the problem with nullification instructions is broad and intractable and applies to all nullification instructions.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35054 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What you're going to hear in a second, I'm sure, because I read it in the briefs, my understanding of the Texas point is slightly different. It is this. That under Texas law, when you file before the, before the trial, a general objection, unless you make the objection again when the specific, when a specific instruction is given, you've forfeited your rights to appeal. Under Texas law. And they say that's true of evidence and that's true here, too. And they say that's just Texas law, ordinary Texas law. Now --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35055 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's nothing --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35056 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's what you did, you didn't make the right objection. Now you come up here and well, you are out. You can't make any argument. But -- we are very generous, and we will let even people who make every wrong procedural thing still have a shot, if what they have, if what they are pointing to absolutely egregious. But your isn't absolutely egregious so you're in the same boat as if you just didn't have any argument because you didn't follow the Texas law. Now, I take it, that's their point. What's your response?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35057 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I have special responses, Your Honor. The objection to the special verdict form and the special issues was made plain in pretrial motions and that objection was clearly recognized by the trial judge at trial and denied at trial when the instructions were being considered for the purposes of voir dire.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35058 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, you're there in a Texas court. We're not. We are following Texas law, they say, and you're wrong. Now, what are we supposed to do about that?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35059 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The court, the Court of Criminal Appeals did not invoke this basis for saying that his trial objection was inadequate. They didn't say that it was made at the wrong time, or in the wrong -- what they specifically said --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35060 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They applied, they applied a legal standard, the egregious harm standard, that depends on failure of an objection. So I would have thought they, they certainly thought that there was an inadequate objection, or they wouldn't have applied that standard.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35061 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. I -- I misspoke if I -- I conveyed the impression that they did not suggest that it was inadequate objection. I was merely suggesting that it wasn't inadequate in the sense that it was made at the wrong time, pretrial or at trial.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35062 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The judge, the judge, I thought, told the lawyers what the charge would be, and I think also said I can't give a separate charge on mitigation because that's a job that only the Texas legislature can do. I am bound by the statute to give these two things. I think the judge said that, so it was the understanding of everyone.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35063 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was the understanding of everyone. It's reflected in the record in the first State habeas opinion that the Court of Criminal Appeals acknowledges that the verdict form was sacrosanct. That was not going to be altered, so the nature of the CCA's suggested failing of Petitioner was that he did not specifically object to the nullification instruction.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35064 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It sounds like you're arguing that the Texas court misapplied Texas law, and you want us to reverse their application of their own law about what is an adequate objection.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35065 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. I believe that the CCA misunderstood the Federal law of the relationship between Penry I and Penry II. The failing in this case was a verdict form that made no mention of mitigating evidence. The nullification instruction was the State's flawed defense to that failing.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35066 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but on the issue of whether there was an adequate -- I thought you were arguing that, in fact, there was an adequate objection. And if the, if the State court held against you on that point, that's an issue of Texas law, isn't it?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35067 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think it is an issue of Texas law, Your Honor, because the basis for the finding that it was inadequate was that he had to separately object to the nullification instruction as opposed to what everyone agreed he object to, was the inadequacy of the verdict form. That was his Federal claim. And our view is that the misunderstanding of the nature of the Federal claim was what led the Texas court to conclude that his objection was inadequate. I'd also like to --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35068 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I, may I again interrupt you to just get the context of your argument? You said earlier that under Chapman, assuming there is a harmless error issue, that essentially is -- is necessarily a Federal issue. And therefore, I take it, the basis of your point here is, if that is a Federal issue, then the adequacy of actions of counsel to raise it is also a Federal issue. Is that correct?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35069 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35070 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is my understanding --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35071 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct, Your Honor.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35072 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35073 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'd like to make it clear --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35074 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do we make up our own procedural rules, too? I mean, why, why -- why is it just a Federal judgment as to whether it adequately complied with the Texas rule? Presumably we should make up our own rule.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35075 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think you need to make up --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35076 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why not? You say it's a Federal question.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35077 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's a Federal question about what the nature of the claim is, and if the State's misunderstanding of the Federal claim was what was intertwined with its conclusion that it was an inadequate objection, that is a misunderstanding of Federal law. We also believe that the procedural, that the application --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35078 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's -- that's a little bit different from your, from your response to Justice Souter. You are making a much narrower argument. You, you don't --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35079 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe our, I believe our right to be --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35080 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You don't assert that in every case when there is a procedural objection in a capital case or any case involving Federal law, Federal law will determine whether the procedural objection is adequate?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35081 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I agree with that fully, Your Honor.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35082 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you do, but you do take that position with respect to a harmless error?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35083 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that the question of whether an error can be deemed harmless is always a Federal question. Chapman says as much.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35084 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. If we assume, for the sake of argument, that there is disagreement on that point, are there any cases of this Court on the matter of adequacy of State procedural bars that would support you, even on the assumption that it's a State, not a Federal issue?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35085 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, clearly Ake vs. Oklahoma holds that if the State invocation of the procedural rule is dependent on a judgment about Federal law, and that judgment is incorrect, it is not an independent basis for decision under the independent adequacy grounds.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35086 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What about the case, the name of which I cannot think of, to the effect that requiring procedural action by the defendant which would simply be a useless formality and so on?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35087 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's Flowers.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35088 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's Flowers. All right. Wouldn't, wouldn't that be authority that you would invoke, in the, in the sense, as I understood your earlier argument, that the, that the pretrial motion and the adjudication of that made it plain to everybody what the, what the issue was, and therefore requiring anything more would -- would in effect violate the Flowers rule?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35089 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I agree with that, Justice Souter. I think that to apply the default in these circumstances where everyone was plainly aware of his concerns about the inadequacy of the verdict form in special -- and the special issues, would be imposing too high and too excessively burdensome a requirement for the preservation of the Federal right. I do also want to argue that there is a --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35090 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why is that -- just, why is that too burdensome? What's so burdensome about saying I object to that instruction?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35091 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, he did --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35092 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're saying, there is a difference between saying it would have been futile and saying it's high and burdensome, and I'm just wondering what your specific point is.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35093 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ My specific point is once he has made it plain -- and this is all that Texas law itself says is required -- once he has made it plain that he objects to a special verdict form which cannot allow for the consideration of mitigating evidence, and this Court's holding is that that is precisely the error in this case, that no supplemental nullification instruction could correct, he has plainly made clear what his objection was and there was nothing else he could do.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35094 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I, may I ask this question about your position? Is it your position that they should not have applied any harmless error review, or that they applied the wrong standard? And if it's the latter, what was the standard they should have applied?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35095 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We believe it is the latter. That we are assuming that harmless error analysis could apply here without conceding that it's necessarily applied, but assuming for the purposes of this case that it does apply, it should have applied the Chapman standard, which is their standard for preserving --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35096 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It wouldn't be preserving the Chapman standard if it was Federal collateral review, would it?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35097 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. It would be under Brett. It would be a different standard. But Texas law for jury instruction claims clearly states that for preserved error, the standard is Chapman.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35098 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's preserved error on direct review, isn't it? On page 23 of their brief there's a footnote that, the red brief, that at least claims to describe the sort of the structure of Texas law, and I thought under Texas law you got a Chapman analysis only if you were on direct review and had preserved error. Is that correct?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35099 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that the CCA's position and Respondent's position is that Almanza applies dually on direct review and post conviction, and that that's that's their explanation for why the State court didn't impose a procedural default on State habeas. And one of our views is even if you don't agree that under Federal law this objection was inadequate, we believe that the State could not in effect change its mind about the adequacy of his trial objection only after this Court summarily reversed its rule on the merits. And we think there are --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but it didn't have to reach the harmless error question after it made an erroneous determination that there was no error at all. When the case came up here and the Court determined there was error, then it was necessary to reach it. I don't see that it's changing its position at all.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it is changing its position. When four judges signal that this may be a procedural impediment in the case and the court declines to embrace it, I think that is a signal to this Court that --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wouldn't it be normal exercise of judicial restraint to say, we don't have to reach out and decide whether this error was harmless if we've already decided there's no error at all?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it would not be in the case of State habeas, for this reason. The vast overwhelming number of cases that proceed into State habeas are on their way when they're final into Federal habeas, and the State court was abandoning this argument for Federal habeas. That is, it was removing any procedural impediment to a merits review.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35104 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I just don't -- you say whenever, whenever a court decides the case on the merits instead of using an intervening procedural objection, the procedural objection is waived.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35105 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I do not make that, I do not make that broad argument, Your Honor. I think in the special circumstances of State habeas, where, as this Court knows, 99 percent of cases are on their way to Federal habeas, and the State does not adopt this procedural impediment which would from a judicial --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35106 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Especially in capital cases, courts don't like to say, oh, you know, yes, you may be innocent but there's this procedural objection. I think most courts --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35107 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm afraid that's not my experience with the court of criminal appeals.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35108 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's my experience with a lot of courts.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35109 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it's a very bad -- I think in the long term in the broad category of cases, it would be a very bad solution for defendants, because what's going to happen, once a court's determined there's no error at all, it's much easier for them to say, oh and by the way if there was it's harmless. And if they did that and then it turns out there was an error, you're going to be back here saying, well, don't be bound by their harmless error decision because they thought there was no error at all, so they didn't focus on it carefully. I would say the way they approached it in this case is the more desirable way. If you don't think there's an error don't go on and decide whether it's harmless or not in the abstract.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35110 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In the vast majority of cases, Chief Justice Roberts, the courts in Texas take that approach, which is if there is a procedural impediment to the case they flag that procedural impediment, rule on alternative grounds, and I think that is good evidence that in this case when four justices urged a procedural element --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35111 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why, why, why do you say there are a lot of cases where it doesn't matter? I would have thought every case it mattered. Look, isn't it an absolute rule that there's a Federal issue in a case and there's a State ground, the State ground typically is a failure to raise an objection, and a State court says the Federal ground is what we're talking about. They say nothing about the State ground and they decide the Federal ground. The defendant goes to a Federal court and he says, I'm entitled to be released because they got the Federal ground wrong. I thought it's a hundred percent the case, and this is where you'll correct me, that it's now too late for the State to raise the State ground but the State's waived their adequate and independent State ground and that if they try to raise it again the answer is always, not some of the time: I'm very sorry, State; you're out of luck; you should have decided it on the State ground and not reached the Federal ground.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35112 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that's exactly right, sir.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35113 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why wouldn't that be the case? Suppose the --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35114 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35115 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose the State --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35116 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't there a difference between waiving it as a procedural bar and waiving it as an objection to the proper standard of review?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't think it's a difference, Your Honor, because we think the underlying fact, the adequacy of the trial objection, was what obtained. And I'd like to point out --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Who gives the State court the power to, as you say, waive that objection? I can understand when you say the prosecutor didn't object. It's the prosecutor that has the power to forfeit certain arguments on behalf of the people which he chooses not to raise.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think "waiver" might not be the right word.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it's clear that if the State court does not rely on a procedural impediment when the case goes into Federal habeas that impediment cannot be reintroduced in the case as a separate ground of decision.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But even if it is, logically anterior to consideration of that procedural impediment is a particular ruling on the merits and the State court didn't make that merits. They thought there was no error. It is logically not necessary for them to decide whether an error is harmless if they don't think there's an error, and to say that they waive that, that later ground I would have thought would be very surprising. Why do we remand these cases for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion if there's nothing further to be considered?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that the concerns for judicial economy in this case would have dictated that if the State court believed that the trial objection was inadequate, it would have rested its decision on that ground to essentially preclude merits review of that Federal constitutional issue.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Otherwise you have a Supreme Court decision that the State court can say, thanks, thanks, that's very interesting advice, but we -- there was a procedural default here. Although we bypassed it the first time, we're not going to bypass it after the Supreme Court has told us what the Federal law is.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it's a special risk in State habeas when the --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35126 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it would be a special risk if you, if you, if you allowed them to raise the bar, allowed a State to raise a bar to consideration of the issue. But I want to go back to your answer to Justice Stevens' question. You, you say you draw no distinction between the, the procedural failing as a bar to raising the issue and as a basis for determining a standard of harmless error review later. I don't understand why you, you can maintain there is no distinction because if they may not consider it as the basis for their, their standard of harmless error review, assuming we have such a thing, then what are they supposed to use as their standard? Your answer I take it is Chapman, but Chapman as I understand the statement of Federal law would not apply -- State law -- Chapman would not apply in these circumstances. And if you were in a Federal court and this were a Federal conviction Chapman wouldn't apply on collateral review. So it seems to me that you've either got to accept the distinction between procedural error as bar to issue, procedural error as basis for standard of review, or you have no way to figure out what the, what the standard of review should be.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35127 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we would take the CCA at its word that the Almanza standard's appropriate. But if the underlying fact of the adequacy of the trial objection has basically been accepted by the State court, we don't believe that on State habeas it could reintroduce the inadequacy of that. I'd like to reserve if I may the remainder of my time.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35128 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cruz.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35130 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: Two postulates govern this case. First, reconciling Jurek and Johnson and Graham on the one hand and Penry II and Tennard and Smith II on the other hand is not an easy task and State and Federal courts have struggled for two decades to draw the appropriate lines and to faithfully apply this court's Penry jurisprudence. Second, the usual default rule in both State and Federal court is that most constitutional errors are subject to harmless error review. Petitioner suggests that the State habeas --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35131 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I take it that is not an issue before us?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is an issue that on the reply brief Petitioner has essentially conceded. In footnote 5 Petitioner states that he is not seeking reversal on the basis that Penry error is structural error. But that is the issue of what the Court of Criminal Appeals did to us.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the Penry error, even if not structural, is not subject to harmless error review and you could say that that distinction is possible because Penry has a built-in harmless error or a harmful error component. But as I understand it that's not -- that issue is not in this case.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is not in this case because of Petitioner's concession, but Petitioner's concession has serious consequences because the only ground upon which Petitioner can prevail in this Court is that the State court's application of harmless error violated the United States Constitution and by giving up his structural error argument he gives up virtually any basis to lay out why that would violate the U.S. Constitution, not simply why it was incorrect but why it is unconstitutional for the State court to apply that doctrine.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's a question of waiver, part of it. I mean, that's -- it's well established that, I guess, I mean, if a State waives an adequate State ground by considering the Federal issue, the Federal courts will go into the Federal ground and they can't later, can they -- is there any case you found anywhere -- I haven't found one -- where say any Federal court considered a State case where the State went into the Federal issue, the State had said nothing about a State ground, and then after the Federal court's decided it somehow the State got a hold of it again and they this time said, oh dear, we forgot, we forgot; in fact, there is the State ground here. And is there any case that you found like that which says that was permissible?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, I do not disagree with you.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35137 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay, there's no such case and therefore this would be the first.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35138 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that's not what happened here.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I do not disagree with you that if the State court had concluded for Petitioner on a State ground TO begin with and after being reversed revisited that conclusion --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no. I'm saying the State typically decides against the defendant. They decide against the defendant on a Federal issue. There's a perfectly adequate State issue. It's called failure to object, and they don't mention it. I'd be repeating myself. Are you following what my, my -- and I'm saying is there any case you found anywhere which says after that occurred that the State when it gets a hold of the case again can say, oh dear, we forgot, there's also this adequate State ground, bad luck? I've never seen such a thing. I doubt that you have.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, there is no suggestion --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I say this would be the first.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35144 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not what happened here and so we are not urging that ground to support what the Court of Criminal Appeals did. But as the Chief Justice suggested, the Almanza standard, the State harmless error standard, is a two-step inquiry. Inquiry number one, is there error; and under State law if you conclude no the analysis ends. So the first time the State court considered this it concluded there is no constitutional error and so it never addressed harmless error.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35145 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm making a mistake here. I thought that the reason they bring in the Almanza standard is, as I put it before, a kind of act of charity. That is, since there was no contemporaneous objection or proper one, you don't get any appeal normally. But we'll let you do it if you can show egregious harm. I'm wrong about that?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is not exactly how the State court and State law does it. What the State law does and our position in this case is that Petitioner failed to preserve his objection because he did not object specifically on the grounds --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but Mr. Cruz, is it not true that if he did fail to preserve the objection then there should have been a procedural bar to the case going forward?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is not a procedural bar --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is that?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- because the State Court of Criminal Appeals has chosen to forgive failure to preserve for purposes of procedural default and subsequent habeas rights.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, they are saying that the failure to object does not constitute -- would constitute a procedural bar if we elected to treat it that way, but we've decided not to, but we're nevertheless going to rely on the failure to object to justify a higher standard of review on harmless error?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's exactly correct, Justice Stevens.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there any precedent for that ambivalent use of a potential procedural bar?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me suggest it's not an ambivalent use, but rather what the Court of Criminal Appeals has held, in the Black case it held that Penry I was so novel that the State courts would excuse a failure to preserve for purposes of procedural bar. So in this regard the State court is more forgiving to defendant than the Federal courts are.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ General Cruz, none of this went on in the opinion and there were four judges of that court who said there's a procedural bar here, end of case. The majority never explained why they weren't going along with that. I didn't see anything in the majority opinion that said, well, never mind that there's a procedural bar here, we're going to deal with the Federal question.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, you're right that in Smith I, the Court of Criminal Appeals, the majority did not explain why there wasn't a procedural bar. But there had been a long line of cases where the CCA had decided Penry errors were not going to bar access to the courthouse, and just last week in another decision that was decided after briefing in the case, in the In Re Hood case, the Court of Criminal Appeals made clear that in its judgment Penry II was also so novel that for purposes of successive risk it would excuse a failure to preserve.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The simple question is the procedural objection, as the four judges suggested, could have precluded consideration of the Federal claim at all.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the court said we're going to go ahead and consider it, and then when it turns out that they got it wrong and there was error they had to apply harmless error review. In Texas law, harmless error review turns on the standard whether there was an objection or not, and they went back and said there was no objection. The contrary assertions assumes that when they let the claim go forward, that they were waiving any reliance on objection for any purposes, not consideration on the merits, but also for any eventual later consideration on harmless error pursuant to the established State standard.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Cruz, would you clarify one thing for me? Did the Texas Court of Appeals say in effect, there is a procedural bar but we're going to waive it, or did they just not address the issue?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In Black they said exactly what you say.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How about in this case?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In this case they didn't -- they didn't say because longstanding CCA precedent made clear that --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you're assuming there's longstanding precedents. It is also at least conceivable that at the time they thought the objection was properly preserved.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is conceivable, but I would suggest the more reasonable inference is they followed their long line of precedents that said we're not going to interpose, as the Chief Justice suggests, a total bar to raising these claims. So for procedural default and for successive writs, we're not going to penalize Petitioners for failing to make objections. Just because the State court decides to be more lenient than the Federal courts in that respect does not mean that they also need to apply the lesser standard of --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you're assuming that they decided to be more lenient rather than assuming that they may have actually decided and rejected the procedural bar.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's at least possible on this record, is it not?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They did not say one way or the other the first time.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. But isn't the implausibility of the argument that you are making something like this: You say the Texas rule is not that failure to object is a procedural bar but that failure to object determines the standard of harmless error review if in fact there is a later appeal. The implausibility, though, I guess of the position is that as I understand it, four members of the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals did not understand that to be the case at all. Four of them said it is a procedural bar. The four did not understand that there was this rule that you invoke, and when the four said there is a procedural bar, the majority of the court never came out and said no, there isn't.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The most reasonable explanation for that, Justice Souter, I would suggest is at the time of Smith III the Court had not decided Hood, which means it had not concluded that Penry II was also so novel that it would forgive failure to raise it.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't the consequence of that, though, that for purposes of this case there was no clear State bar at the time in question and therefore, they cannot apply it now? Maybe they can apply it in cases down the road. I'll assume for the sake of argument that they can. But not in your case, because the bar was not established at the relevant time in your case.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That would arguably be the case if on remand the Court of Criminal Appeals had applied procedural default and refused to consider the case -- the claim, but not what it did.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. But what it is doing is in effect saying there was a kind of default which is subsumed in what the four dissenting justices said the first time around. And so we're going to, we're going to sort of call it a half-loaf procedural default, but we never said so the first time around.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Respectfully, they are altogether separate concepts that procedural default is a total bar to the courthouse.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I can understand that they would be separate concepts if there were a rule or if there had been a rule in place at the time he was going through his State habeas that so said. But we don't seem to have such a rule because as you said, there was disagreement within the court, and Hood had not been decided, and therefore --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But Black had.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Pardon me?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Black had and Almanza had.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Black being -- help me out, Black?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Black is what excused the failure to raise Penry I for novelty. And so it was clearly established State law at the time of this trial --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that goes to Penry I, and this is then an objection both to Penry I and based on Penry II.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it's --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the Hood -- the Hood decision with respect to Penry II is being forgiving to criminal defendant. It's not a bar. It's forgiving a bar. That does not mean that the Almanza standard which had been present for -- has been present in State law for over 20 years is suddenly inadequate.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're right.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But did they cite that case in this case, in this opinion in this case?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They absolutely cited Almanza.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Speaking of that case, can you give me any citation? And just give me a citation, and here there may not be one, but you give me a citation where Texas previously said that a defendant who raised an objection before trial to the application of the statute to his client, he said it's unconstitutional as applied to my client, give me one example in Texas law where that was raised and the State appeals court of any -- at any level said, I'm very sorry, you can't really appeal that because you should have said it again during the trial.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Respectfully, Justice Breyer, that is not what we are urging, and I'm very glad you asked that question because I'd like to clarify what we are urging in our brief. That is not why we think Smith is not defaulted.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, there's no case, there's no case in Texas law which says what I just said?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't know if there is or not but our --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You can't say.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Our argument is not based on the timing of the objection, so it has nothing to do with when he did or didn't raise his objection. And so --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought it was because he didn't raise it again in the trial.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is not --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is the argument?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The argument is that he made a different objection, a substantively different objection, because what he filed was an argument that the Texas death penalty was unconstitutional on its face across the board and as applied to him, and he made a conscious strategic choice which is, when the judge presented a charge to the counsel and said do you have any objections, do you have any suggestions, is there any way I can change it, he could have done what Penry's counsel did. Penry's counsel twice asked the judge, please instruct the jury on deliberateness so they can consider my mitigating evidence for deliberateness. Penry I said that would solve the Penry problem.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. But in this case the counsel for the defendant did one other thing, and it said to the judge, you don't have authority under State law to add to these supplemental instructions. And I was going to ask you, he was right about that, wasn't he?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, he was categorically wrong about that, and that fundamentally --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Really?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. For two reasons. Number one, because Penry I, which has already been decided, this Court has said the way to correct a Penry error is to give an instruction. And the Court of Criminal Appeals following Penry had already squarely held the way to correct a Penry error is to give an instruction.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What instruction? I haven't seen one. I haven't seen --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was it the nullification instruction?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's what the Court of Criminal Appeals has said Penry I said, a deliberateness instruction or a catch-all instruction. So -- but in both cases, both this Court and the State court have said judges can give an instruction. And Penry I's counsel made --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is your instruction -- I think this is of some importance. My understanding in this case is that the judge as well as counsel thought that the judge couldn't say in essence what became the Texas law because the legislature put it in, which is: Jury, is it two special issues, but you can consider all the mitigating evidence and it's up to you if you think that mitigating evidence is enough to have a life rather than a death sentence. That I thought the judge couldn't do. I have not seen a prelegislative change, charge in Texas that says what the legislature provided.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, that is in fact what the judge did here. What the judge could do clearly under Texas law is give any reasonable instruction to cure the error. What the judge couldn't do is submit a third special issue. It couldn't ask the jury, check, is there enough mitigating evidence to sentence to death. So it couldn't change the output from the jury. It couldn't add a new special issue but it could give any instruction possible to correct the error. That was Texas law, that you could give instructions, but the special issues are set by statute.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And so the jury, what they take into the jury room is something that says these are the two questions that you must answer.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But they also have a written charge, so they get a written charge with the instruction.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which tells them that the only way that they can give effect to mitigating evidence is if they answer one of those questions falsely.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But this Court said in both Penry I and Penry II that if the trial judge defined deliberateness appropriately, even under the old special issues, that it could solve the problem.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But in this case the judge said I'm going to give the nullification instruction, and the attorney said, and I think quite properly, he said that won't work.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what the attorney -- the attorney didn't say that won't work because it puts jurors in an ethical quandary, it causes them to violate the oath. What the attorney said is, you can give no instructions. And the reason for that strategic choice is that Smith's counsel made the judgment, I want it to be impossible for my client to be subject to the death penalty. Had Smith's counsel made the same objection that Penry made, had he read Penry right in front of him and asked, give me a deliberateness instruction, it would have cured the error. But the reason I would suggest that Smith's counsel didn't is that the quantum of mitigating evidence in this case was so slight compared to the pervious cases that he made a very conscious strategic choice, I'd rather go all or nothing. I would rather make an argument that there is --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ General Cruz, how can you make that assumption when the kind of mitigating evidence that has been considered possible within these special questions, the -- the -- in the Graham case where the reputation of this young man, he was sweet, gentle, kind, God fearing, and so the murder that he committed was an aberration. And youth. Those are the two things that I know that we have recognized fall within that. The evidence in this case is surely not that we are dealing with a sweet and kind person. We are dealing with somebody who has been abused as a child and who has a mental disorder.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Respectfully, Justice Ginsburg, the evidence was precisely that he had been sweet and kind. Over 90 percent of the evidence that defense counsel relied on in closing was the 15 character witnesses to show that he was a big lovable Teddy bear and went to church, and was sweet and kind, and he had overcome these obstacles, and this was a momentary aberration. That was the central theme of defense's arguments. And in fact when the court --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ When you say 90 percent, you're talking about argument time, aren't you?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm talking --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your answer to that is, there were several hundred pages of records from school and the testing that went on in school that indicated there was something seriously wrong with this guy.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well -- and it's interesting. The several hundred pages they talk about, there are three IQ tests that he had gotten. When he was 7 years old he tested at 87; when he was 10 years old he tested at 87; when he was 13 he tested at 78. They -- and they introduced all three. These were the school records. There weren't competing experts. It's interesting in closing arguments --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. Maybe -- but the fact is that we're talking right now about sort of quantum of evidence. Was there something serious there for the jury to consider which in effect is the basis for all of this argument? And it seems to me it's not fairly characterized by saying, well, 90 percent of the mitigation case was that he was sweet and loving there. Whether you find it -- whether you find it persuasive or not, there was a substantial amount of evidence of -- going to his mental capacity and to his abuse.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CRUZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, not only was it a very small part of the presentation, but in closing argument defense counsel explicitly pointed out to the jury that -- and let me read from defense counsel's closing: "I think it speaks well for both sides, the State and the defense to be quite honest, that we didn't bring you some hired gun, some psychiatrist that gets paid to get up here and say oh well, these are all family problems." And that is at 33, volume 33 of the record, page 59. He affirmatively -- in Penry the whole argument was there's IQ problems, there's serious abuse. There's no abuse in this case, Justice Ginsburg, no allegation of abuse whatsoever. And he affirmatively said to the jury, look, we're not relying on some psychiatrist saying there are all these family problems. Our story is that this is a good person who led a good life and this is an aberration.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Cruz. Mr. Schaerr.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35224 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: I represent California and 20 other states who are concerned about the implications of Petitioner's arguments for their ability to apply their own varied harmless error standards in their own State habeas proceedings, and thereby to strike what they believe to be the right balance between the two competing concerns that this Court identified in Calderon. One being the significant social costs of retrial or resentencing, and the other the desire to ensure that the extraordinary remedy of habeas corpus is available to those whom society has grievously wronged. And with those concerns in mind, I'd like to address three specific points. The first is the whole question of whether States have the ability under our Federal Constitution to choose their own harmless error standards even when they are addressing Federal error. Petitioner appears to concede as a general matter that States do have that authority, but let me just briefly indicate why that concession is well founded. First of all, as this Court has held in Pennsylvania versus Finley --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are you talking about both collateral review and direct review, or just collateral review?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm just talking about collateral review right now. As this Court has held in Pennsylvania versus Finley, the States are under no obligation to provide collateral review at all, and so it would be extraordinary if they take the step of deciding that they will provide such review, for this Court to say, well, if you're going to do that you have to apply a Federal standard on State habeas review rather than the standard that you choose. Secondly, to the extent the States decide to provide habeas review or any other kind of post-conviction review, the authority by which they do that derives from State law, not from the Federal Constitution or any other Federal law, and this Court obviously does not have general supervisory authority over, over State courts as it does Federal courts. And third, unlike the situation with direct review, this Court could not as a practical matter impose a Federal standard on State habeas proceedings without being highly intrusive. I mean --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In, in this case suppose the following circumstance. Suppose a Federal court has decided in the case of this defendant --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- there was an error of Federal constitutional law, search and seizure or confessions or something, and now we send it back. And let's suppose further the State has no independent State ground, they are not trying to make the argument, whether or not they're trying to make it here. There's no independent State ground, no objection to problem, nothing. Now, I read that one standard that could be applied is the structural error standard. A second is a harmless error standard. But I've never seen a case, but that's perhaps my ignorance -- -that's whey want you to show me -- where it's definitively established by a Federal court anyway that there was a serious Federal error, I've never seen a case where this Court said, or I can't recall one, that the State applied yet some third kind of standard, such as, well, I know there was a very important error, I know it was Federal and constitutional, but nonetheless we're not going to give them any remedy unless it's absolutely egregious harm. I've never seen that in the law. Now, can you point to me in the law where, which will correct my lacuna?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not aware that the Court has expressly addressed that precise question, which I think is --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Have you ever seen it in a State? Have you ever seen a State which gets a case back from --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where? Where should I look on that?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, our amicus brief, Your Honor, cites, cites dozens of cases in which, in which States have addressed Federal --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. I'm not talking about that because obviously they can do what they want, I think, in the State courts, but they might violate Federal law if they do it. And now so what's happened is somebody has gone into Federal court or this Court and Federal court or this Court has said: Here's a Federal error, of course you're free to apply harmless error or whatever, you don't have to let the person have a new trial or let him out. But I've never seen an instance I can think of where, that having happened, the State then applied yet some third standard like absolutely egregious horrible harm or not totally wonderful harm or something like that. I've never seen. That's what I'm looking for. Is there such an instance?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Or plain error, as applied in the Federal cases under Alano.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, that's possible.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there some reason, Mr. Schaerr, why that would be more egregious when the Federal constitutional question has been answered by a Federal district court than it is when the Federal constitutional question has been answered by the State supreme court? Wouldn't it be just as bad when the State supreme court has said the Federal Constitution has been violated and then the case goes back to the lower State court and the lower State court applies some standard for plain error which is, which is simply different from what is, what is being urged here today. I'm sure that happens all the time.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sure it does.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I don't know why it's any worse, any worse when you do it to a Federal district court's determination of what the Federal Constitution says than when you do it to the State supreme court's determination of what the Federal Constitution says.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I guess the reason would be that there is a problem with enforcing Federal constitutional standards. I have not heard of a State that says, suppose the jury was chosen in a racially discriminatory way, suppose there are all kinds of things, the State says, well, we admit, we admit that there is this violation, but we're just not going to apply a harmless error standard. We're going to apply a tough one. I guess that would be the reason. That's why I don't think I've ever seen it.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, and the question is whether the State is free in that circumstance to apply a State harmless error standard or if it has to be required to apply a Federal harmless error standard. And our -- and the fact is that on the ground the States are routinely applying State harmless error standards in those situations. And so it would be a sea change if this Court were to now hold that, no, when a State court is reviewing the effect of a Federal error that the State court has to apply a Federal standard rather than the State.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there any special Federal harmless error standard that applies to unpreserved error?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it's the Alano standard, at least in the Federal --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's for Federal, that's in the Federal courts. But there isn't one that's applicable able to the State courts, is there?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. There isn't.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we haven't had the issue before us, have we? That's why you're here.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's why I'm here, that's right.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This question is a little different. If you had two harmless errors in a given State, do they have to apply them consistently?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, then the question would be is there some Federal law reason why they have to. I mean, they may under State law have to apply them --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In other words, if for example the higher standard only applies to unpreserved error and the record clearly establishes and the several State judges confirm there was no unpreserved error, then would there not be a duty to apply the lower standard?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There may be under State law, it's not clear why that would raise a Federal issue.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if the State follows the rule in just one exceptional case before the Federal court, can the court said, hey, you're not following your regular rule?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there may be a due process objection to that, but here the only objection --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there no Federal interest in ensuring that there is a full and fair implementation of a Federal right? And if the State higher standard is erroneously applied, doesn't that prejudice the Federal right?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that may be one reason why we have Federal habeas proceedings.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that reason would apply equally, however, to determinations of Federal rights by State courts.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I think everybody understands that State courts do this all the time, and indeed a good way to do an end run around what, what, what the other side in this case seems to want is simply for the State supreme court to find a violation of Federal law so that it doesn't get to a Federal court and then have the State lower court apply whatever harmless error standard it wishes, which would be a crazy system.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So if you're going to adopt this rule, this rule would have to be adopted not only for references back to the State court from a Federal decision, but you would surely have to apply it to all State determinations of Federal law, and I don't really know what authority we would have to require lower State courts to do that.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SCHAERR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's, that's exactly right and especially in the habeas context it would be, it would be extremely intrusive and invasive for this Court to attempt to do that. It's one thing on direct review of a State criminal conviction to say as a matter of Federal constitutional law we think there was an error here and we're going to nullify the conviction, which is what the Constitution gives this Court the power to do. But it's quite another, after the conviction is final and the defendant is already incarcerated, then on a State habeas proceeding for the issue to come, to come back to this Court, it would be extraordinary for this Court to say, well, you have to apply Federal standards or Federally dictated procedures in that circumstance. Thank you.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Steiker, you have 4 minutes remaining.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35266 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'd like to return to the record in this case because I think once it's clarified what the nature of the evidence was in this case it's clear that this Court could find that the error was harmful under any standard, including the egregious harm standard. We have in this case over 200 pages of exhibits documenting a lifelong disability. This evidence was first introduced in the guilt-innocence phase of the trial. It was argued at the guilt-innocence closing argument, in which trial counsel said, this is a 19-year-old ninth grader who has been charged with this crime, and argued that that was the basis for considering him less culpable than his college-educated co-defendant. During the punishment phase, it's clear that the single most important witness, the one whose testimony was the most central, the most time-consuming, was Alberta Pingle, who brought in all of the school records showing from at the time the Petitioner was in school he had been diagnosed as a learning disabled, possibly organic in nature, 78 IQ. And his counsel emphasized this as the central basis for withholding a death sentence. He said, this man has a 78 IQ, 8 points from being mentally retarded, lifelong learning disabilities, possibly organic in nature. And the argument that there was no evidence of abuse in this case is belied by the fact that the evidence showed that Petitioner's father chased him with a butcher knife in order to steel the family's car in order to support his crack habit. If that's not evidence of abuse and evidence that could show reduced culpability for this defendant, coupled especially with his impairment which made him less capable of responding to that role model and avoiding dangerous behavior --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What about General, Mr. Cruz's comments that this was a minor point in counsel's summation before the jury?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is true that this evidence was presented as only one page of his closing argument, but that was because of the problem in this case. As this Court noted in its summary reversal, the prosecutor got up right before defense counsel and said: You promised us on voir dire you would answer the special issues honestly and that if the evidence supported a yes answer to deliberateness and dangerousness you would give us yes answers. Basically, right before he spoke the prosecutor gave an anti-nullification instruction which said this evidence isn't relevant to the special issues of deliberateness and dangerousness. In that posture, he was left to argue that the evidence showed he wasn't dangerous, that the evidence showed he didn't act deliberately, and just hope that the jury would be willing to lie on the special verdict form.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is this argument an assertion that the Texas State court was wrong in its determination of this question of Texas State law?
05-11304 +++$+++ 35270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ His argument --
05-11304 +++$+++ 35271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, your argument right now.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry. I don't understand.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is your argument an argument that the Texas State court was wrong on its ruling under Texas State law harmless error.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEIKER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. Our argument is that when you take out the clearly impermissible Federal conclusion that the jury could give effect to this evidence, which was exactly what this Court said to the contrary in its summary reversal -- this Court said this evidence couldn't be considered. The State court said he has extensive evidence, he has powerful evidence, powerfully presented, dramatically presented, but we think, unlike the Supreme Court, that a carefully crafted nullification instruction will facilitate the jurors' consideration of it. So if you take away the impermissible Federal conclusion, this Court could clearly conceive, conclude, on the basis of the State court's own characterization of this evidence, which departs tremendously from the Respondent's view, that this was powerful mitigating evidence. The Court of Criminal Appeals' error was to conclude that this could be taken into account after this Court said exactly the opposite. Thank you, Your Honor.
05-11304 +++$+++ 35275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35279 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument this morning in case 05-1157, Credit Suisse Securities versus Billing, et al. Mr. Shapiro.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35281 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The pivotal question in this case is whether this Court's decisions in Gordon and NASD require implied antitrust immunity as the district court believed. And we submit that the answer is yes. The '33 and '34 acts were of course passed for the very purpose of regulating IPOs and alleged market manipulation. And this Court has referred to these laws as the anchor of Federal economic policy in the securities field. And under these laws the SEC has laid down detailed regulations applicable to the very practices that are at issue in this case with active supervision by the SEC and the NASD. And it has done this with full understanding that syndicated underwriting is inherently concerted action. An underwriting requires joint action in accumulating information and setting the price of the offering along with allotting shares to customers. Now the Gordon and NASD cases apply directly here because of the danger of inconsistency and conflict which the SEC cited. As in cases of this Court in the past, like NASD and Gordon and later Trinko, Congress required this expert administrative agency to take competition into account when issuing its standards. And review in antitrust courts across the country would once again raise the danger of false positives and conflicts and wasteful redundancy.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Did it, did it specifically state that, or is it that or just the principle that all Federal agencies have an obligation to --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, no, Your Honor, it is very express in 75 and then again in the 96. Capital formation, investor protection and competition have to be weighed against each other by the SEC, and in Gordon this Court attached great importance to that standard, which differs from the competition first standard of, the antitrust laws impose.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Shapiro, to what extent has the SEC regulated the specific vertical restraints that are alleged here?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The SEC regulates the -- the alleged tie-ins and it regulates the alleged excessive compensation claims.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And laddering, for example?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Laddering, tying, and excessive compensation. And it's had a number of enforcement actions. Its regulation M is focused exactly on those practices. It's issued very detailed guidance in a document that we attach to our petition appendix on what constitutes --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And are we to assume that if the allegations are true, which they of course may not be, that this is a violation of the -- of the securities laws?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well the SEC has said it depends on the circumstances. And they draw very fine lines in this area, Your Honor. And if, in fact, the SEC concludes it is a tie-in under its finely calibrated standards, then yes. But that's the critical issue here. It is very easy to term these things excessive compensation or tie-ins, but when the NASD looked at a real complaint of this sort in the Invemed case it found that there was no excessive compensation and no commercial bribery. And --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How about in this case Did the SEC examine that question at all in this case? And did it take any position?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In this case it took no position on the merit of the underlying claims, but it said that there would be serious problems if antitrust law were applied to these allegations. It would interfere with the agency's ability to define what is manipulation and to amend its definitions. It has ongoing rulemaking proceedings right now addressed to this issue; and it said further that it would discourage underwriters from going up to the line of prohibition, which is very important in this area. Because if they don't step over the line and they engage in book building conversations, that's critical to setting the right price for the IPO. And so --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How should we, we weigh -- Congress is asking with respect to securities, private securities litigation, Congress looked at that and thought some restraint had to be placed on private actions, but it didn't do anything with respect to antitrust private action.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We think part of the repugnance analysis here should focus on the fact that these securities claims have simply been repleaded as antitrust claims. Congress wasn't aware of any problem of this sort; nobody had attempted to replead securities violations like tie-ins and excessive compensation as antitrust claims. And Congress of course relied --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Doesn't, doesn't the statute specifically provide for -- for exactly this possibility? Doesn't both the '33 and the '34 act have a saving other remedies clause?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't refer to antitrust cases. Those were references to state law remedies that Congress later contracted with the --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was it -- were those two clauses expressly limited to state law remedies?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. They referred to other claims, Your Honor, but they don't refer to antitrust. So we don't believe --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But do they have to?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't believe --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35300 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ None of the claims includes an antitrust claim on its face.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35301 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we think -- we think they don't apply to antitrust, and in Gordon and NASD those same provisions were in place but that didn't deter the Court from finding them --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't even think we mentioned them. Did we mention them?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Pardon me?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Did we mention them in those cases?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't believe the Court did.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, maybe we just forgot. (Laughter.)
05-1157 +++$+++ 35307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They -- well, they -- they don't pertain to antitrust. If you look at the history of those provisions they are talking about state causes of action and there's no reference to antitrust as such in them. That's quite different from Trinko where there was an antitrust savings clause that went on in detail about saving the antitrust cause of action. The danger of conflict that the SEC is talking about here is an acute danger to its ability to --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What happened in respect to the SEC? What about primary jurisdiction? That's what I wondered as I read this. Nobody mentions it. But there's certainly a lot of precedent in the area in this kind of thing. You ask the agency, have to go to the agency, see what they say.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, the reason it doesn't get mentioned is in that Gordon the Court held primary jurisdiction was not a fix for this kind of conflict. And here the SEC has expressed its opinion in its amicus briefs already. The Court is aware of those positions laid out in our cert petition --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The allegations in this are quite different from Gordon. There you have got a horizontal -- allegedly horizontal agreement. Here you have got a vertical agreement which it seems to me depends on non-disclosure for it work at all. If there been full disclosure of all these laddering and flippings I don't see how in the world you would ever get a -- an antitrust violation.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, the conflict is different, but it's really quite a more serious conflict than it was in Gordon. In Gordon the only concern was the SEC might reinstitute fixed rates in the future, and it never did that in 30 years. Here the SEC says the conflict goes to our ability to define manipulation and to amend our rules which we're in the process of doing and we can't have conduct deterred.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Mr. Shapiro, you're doing a good job of defending the SEC's interests but your position goes considerably beyond their position today.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the SEC in the lower courts advocated dismissal of the complaints; and in the Supreme Court, of course, they've -- they've urged for a vacator of the lower court decision. And the brief of the SG echoes many of the concerns that the SEC expressed in the lower courts.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's why I wonder about primary jurisdiction. You put a burden on the, on the plaintiffs to go to the agency and the agency could take a range of positions. It might say this is absolutely unlawful, BUT it's close enough we think an antitrust court has no business mucking around in this. Or it's unlawful and we don't care. Or, it's not -- in which case they could bring their suit. Or it's -- it's not unlawful but we don't care, or it's not unlawful and we do care. I mean, there is a range of positions they could take which was the purpose of the primary jurisdiction doctrine, to see in the context of the particular conduct, not general but in the context of the particular conduct, what the agency thought about this in terms of its regulatory mission.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think Gordon is very informative on that point. It rejected primary jurisdiction because the agency's views were already known to the Court. Here the SEC has filed a 40-page submission in the district court explaining that the suit has to be dismissed because of conflict with the administrative scheme.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's in respect to the particular conduct at issue here.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely. The particular conduct at issue --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course the Petitioners have not had an opportunity, I would think -- they filed a complaint. But they've not had an opportunity to argue this out in front of the SEC with particular evidence, with particular witnesses, et cetera.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what this Court said in Gordon was that it's a legal question whether there is potential interference with the administrative scheme for us to decide the SEC's views are entitled to considerable deference, the Court said. But if they've been submitted in the form of amicus briefs, that is sufficient to demonstrate the repugnance.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I suppose if primary jurisdiction were a cure-all, there would never be any cases in which the regulatory scheme did not displace the antitrust laws.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's absolutely right. In that case, where the Court did refer an antitrust issue, the agency declined to take the reference. And here there there was a factual issue the agency was supposed to opine on. Here we have a pure legal question, the Court has held, of potential repugnance with the SEC scheme. That's for the Court to decide.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The difference between this case and Gordon is that this case, the heart of their allegations are failure to disclose which is quintessentially the SEC's business, making sure disclosures are right. I don't think if there were disclosure, they would have a problem in this case. Am I missing something on that?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what the SEC says is that if the conduct is ordinary book building, communications about future transactions, at future prices, there's no misconduct to be disclosed. It is perfectly permissible.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The allegation in the complaint is there was no disclosure.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The complaint alleges an antitrust violation. Just that there was agreement to engage in tie-ins, and an agreement not to --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The allegation is the agreement -- the agreement not to disclose.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That certainly highlights why this is an SEC case and not an antitrust case, it seems to me, because that -- disclosure is for this administrative agency to wrestle with, and it has made clear that investor welfare will be harmed and issuer welfare will be harmed if these sensitive questions are taken from it and are frozen by antitrust judgments. That was the problem the Court faced in NASD and it was the problem the Court faced in Gordon.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me just ask one more question, Mr. Shapiro. Supposing there had been full disclosure here. Do you think there would be an antitrust violation?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in part, I would say yes, there was an agreement in restraint of trade --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Agreeing on what the --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yeah, that's their theory.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The preliminary before the IPO. But what they did after the IPO, would that violate the antitrust laws?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Really what they are alleging is a conspiracy to violate the securities laws here, that had some -- what they claim, a market effect. And it is the agreement that they contend is an unreasonable restraint of trade or they refer to the compensation payments as excessive commercial bribes. They say that violates the Robinson-Patman Act. The trouble is no matter how you phrase this, no matter how they could amend their pleading, inherent in the case are challenges to tie-ins and alleged excessive compensation payments that under the securities laws have to be regulated by the SEC. The Government has to speak with one voice on this issue under one set of standards, or administrative law gets frozen. And there's a huge deterrent effect on underwriters.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are there many situations in which a particular industry is subject to regulators and they sometimes conflict? Like EPA and OSHA?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, yes. Under these two decisions of the Court, NASD and Gordon, there has to be active supervision or pervasive regulation by the agency, and then a direct conflict with what the SEC is trying to accomplish. There are a number of things that can be regulated even under the antitrust laws under those standards. NASD and Gordon didn't stop all antitrust litigation in its tracks. Only things that were within the agency's supervisory jurisdiction to present --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The EPA is not a hands-on regulatory agency the way the SEC is. It has not been given an entire industry to regulate.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35337 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that's right, Your Honor. The '33 Act, if you look at the Act, every provision in it is focused on IPOs. It is state of the art comprehensive legislation. The '34 Act in three separate provisions gives the SEC power to define manipulation. Then it has rulemaking power and then it has exemption power. This is comprehensive. It is far more pervasive than the kind of regulation that was before the Court in NASD. In that case, there was just unexercised rulemaking power. Here we have got voluminous regulations, we have interpretations, we have many enforcement actions aimed at this very same conduct.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35338 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the Government says that's fine where the regulations have been issued, and where they -- where they render the action here lawful. There's no -- no problemo. What's wrong with that?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the Government says --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Government's willing, in other words, to give the SEC carte blanche. Whatever you say is lawful is lawful that won't violate the antitrust laws.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We think immunity extends beyond what is expressly permitted by the SEC. The way the Court phrased it in NASD was things that are connected to the agency's regulatory responsibility have to be immunized to allow the agency to do its task. And that extends a little bit further than the permission standard that the Government has given. And there --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35342 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Extends a lot further, I would think.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35343 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would think it does. I would think the NASD case would come out the other way under the standard the SG is using today. But we think we win under the inextricably intertwined standard, because all of this conduct is closely connected to what is permissible. There's a very fine line between what is forbidden and what is permitted. They can ask about future market prices. They can give the IPOs to their best customers, but they can't solicit a transaction in the immediate aftermarket while the IPO is still --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35344 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So we could decide that way. We could say, we don't have to decide what the standard is, even if it is inextricably intertwined as the Government does, you would win, you would be happy --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35345 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We would win under either of these standards. But what we advocate is dismissal with prejudice, which is the relief the Court gave in the NASD case, and not a shapeless remand of the case for further pleading. And the reason for that is that the interference would overhang the market. The interference would affect the SEC's ability to lay down the standards and encourage conduct going up to the line of prohibition. And the remedy that the Court approved in NASD is exactly appropriate here, dismissal with prejudice. These plaintiffs did not even seek to amend their complaints in the lower courts. Under Second Circuit law, they've waived their right to seek an amendment. So we, in sum, urge the Court to stick with its own standards in NASD and Gordon. The standards are not broken. They don't need to be fixed. Nobody has pointed to any changed circumstances that would warrant a change in this Court's decisions, and those decisions require dismissal with prejudice. If there are no further questions, we'd reserve the balance of our time.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Shapiro. General Clement.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35348 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States has responsibility for enforcing both the securities laws through the SEC and the antitrust laws through the Justice Department and the FTC. It thus has a critical interest in ensuring that these laws can be reconciled in a manner that gives effect to both, and completely ousts neither. Any effort to try to reconcile those laws in the specific context of the underwriting of IPOs has to begin with an understanding of the particular regulatory context and scheme. The SEC obviously carefully regulates both the registration and the underwriting process for individual IPOs. There are two aspects of that regulatory regime that are particularly important: First, the approval for all sorts of collaborative conduct that is the hallmark of the underwriting syndicate. And second, the very fine nature of the distinctions that the SEC draws between permissible book building activity and impermissible market manipulation. And in that regulatory context, the kind of collaborative conduct that would in many other contexts raise yellow or red flags of an antitrust violation is innocuous, because it's a hallmark of the underwriting process. Equally important, the SEC does make certain conduct like tie-ins and laddering unlawful, but very closely related conduct is not only permissible, but is considered beneficial to the capital formation process.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask this question about the laddering and so forth? If it were fully disclosed, would it be unlawful under either statute.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it might, Justice Stevens. The prohibitions on laddering and tie-ins are not just disclosure provisions. And I think as a practical matter, if these kind of things were disclosed, they probably wouldn't happen. So it's a little hard to --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I can see how they would affect the market if they were disclosed.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That may be true, but the way the regulation approaches that conduct is a little bit more of a prophylactic approach. It's not just a disclosure approach, and it does say that there's conduct that is forbidden. But I think it is important to recognize just how fine the lines that are drawn here become, because, to give you a real world example, the guidance document that's at page 216A of the petition appendix makes clear that it is permissible for the lead underwriter, when talking to customers, to gauge their interest at various price points in the initial offering.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In light of the very fine line, how is the Court to distinguish between -- determine whether what's alleged is inextricably intertwined with authorized conduct?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think if you were looking at a challenge that took place solely within the context of a single IPO, it would probably be so difficult that I think we would concede that you can't practically separate the two. What I think is important from the standpoint of the Justice Department and its antitrust responsibilities is you don't want to sweep an immunity so broad that it would, say, give cover to a conspiracy that cut across IPOs, and was an effort to fix commission rates, or to make territorial agreements, or exclude a rival investment bank from the underwriting process.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the problem you address has been a problem of strike suits. And it is the problem that Congress addressed in its legislation. Shake downs. It just is less expensive to pay off the suitor than it is to litigate it to a final conclusion, where that conclusion is highly uncertain. And I don't see how your -- your solution of inextricably intertwined, where there's a penalty of treble damages if you guess wrong about that line, I don't see how that's going to stop the strike suits any more than the current situation does.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I wouldn't want to roll the dice on whether something is inextricably intertwined, with treble damages at the end.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, I think that you could certainly perform this test and make the test protect conduct sufficient to protect against that threat. We are certainly sensitive to the threat that a regulatory agency is trying to draw a fine line between two closely related areas of conduct. They're not going to be able to enforce that line as a practical matter if the regulated community knows that the consequence of having a foot fault in crossing that line will be treble damages in a class action suit. On the other hand, we would caution against adopting some sort of broad immunity that would preclude, say, the Justice Department from investigating and prosecuting an antitrust conspiracy that cut across IPOs. And of course, the Congress has addressed the problem of treble damages directly in a number of areas. And I suppose, if they were to address the area in the antitrust context, they might draw a distinction between private treble damages suits and Government enforcement efforts. Now, that's a little hard to do --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They might, but they haven't yet. A couple of times you've used this phrase cutting across IPOs. Are you saying there should be an absolute immunity from antitrust prosecution within a single IPO?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, I would warn you off of sort of saying absolutely no. I think as a practical matter, though, it is going to be -- I mean, I can't conceive of a ready example of where an allegation that is specific to an internal single IPO would really be practically inseparable. So I think the role of the antitrust laws will largely be in allegations that cut across IPOs.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And even then, why do you take the other position? It is pretty easy to imagine the SEC, under some circumstances, deciding that's a proper way to market securities, to have some kinds of agreements between IPOs or something like that. I don't see why not.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I suppose it's possible, Justice Breyer.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is possible. I'm back to Justice Alito's question. I mean, if you're worried about taking authority from the Department to prosecute territorial restrictions as some kind of blatant price fix, that's not in front of us. So this doesn't have to be precedent for that. You're talking about this case. And there, I think the Respondent -- the Petitioners here say that my goodness, we don't see any way that a district court is going to be able to start talking about whether this evidence is protected. What does that mean, protected? Maybe protected here, because they have thought about it, but there will be a lot of cases where the SEC hasn't thought about the particular conduct. We don't know what they're going to prove. I'm back to Justice Alito. How is anybody going to administer the standard that you are asking the Court to enunciate?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think if you draw a distinction between intraIPO allegations and interIPO allegations, you go a long way towards doing it. And I should note, that's basically the line this Court drew in NASD. If you look particularly at the part of the decision that deals with count 1 of the Government's complaint, that was a horizontal allegation. And it was all in the context of vertical agreements that were specific to a particular mutual fund. And in that context, this Court said that with respect to the horizontal agreement, there's nothing in the SEC regulations that specifically addresses that, but the SEC specifically blesses the vertical agreements, so we're going to give additional immunity to that horizontal agreement. That same page, page 733 of the opinion, they say, what we don't have before us is an allegation by the government that there is a scheme here to reduce competition between mutual funds. There is no allegation that they were trying to cut down, there was an agreement that would cut down competition between Fidelity and Wellington, for example. It was all in the context of individual funds and retarding the secondary market for individual funds. The language the Court used on page 733 of that opinion seems to us a perfectly reasonable test. The Court said, quote: "The close relationship is fatal" the close relationship between what the SEC had prohibited in the vertical context and what was sought to be gone after in the context of the horizontal restraints, those are too closely related. I don't think that test has caused the undue confusion. And I think what it does it makes a reasonable balance between a ruling that on the one hand preserves a great deal of immunity, but on the other hand doesn't give a kind of blanket immunity that would basically completely oust the antitrust laws. And I think that's the balance we hope to --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What happens on remand in this very case based on your theory? You are not adopting the district judge's position that this case should be dismissed outright.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right, Justice Ginsburg, and --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What happens when it goes back?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think this Court could do one of two things. I mean, the Petitioners for their part have pointed to in footnote 6 of the blue briefs, to a variety of Second Circuit precedents about the standards for repleading. Perhaps the easiest course for this Court would be to just vacate and let the Second Circuit apply its own law of repleading. That would be one option. The other option would be --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But why, if this is a sprawling complaint and if the problem is that it says too much or too vaguely? A district court doesn't have to leave the pleader to its own devices. It can have a pretrial conference and say, now let's get this whole thing in order, and it's not that the pleader is left alone to do what he or she will. But in complex cases like this, the district judge will often assert control from the beginning and not leave the parties to do what they want.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We would have no objection to that, Justice Ginsburg. And I would say, you know, you might say that, particularly based on the guidance this Court gives in this case and the guidance this Court gives perhaps in the Twombley case, that it might be fair to let the plaintiffs have a crack at making a new complaint in this area. Oh the other hand, as I say, we would have no objection to just allowing the Second Circuit to sort it out based on Second Circuit pleading law. I think the important thing from our perspective --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What would, what would a satisfactory complaint for this party look like?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, it's a little hard for me to frame that complaint. I think if it focused on inter-IPO allegations and, contrary to this complaint, paragraph 42 of this complaint, actually alleges that there were a variety of different mechanisms that were used, that doesn't sound like what you would expect from a disagreement that cut across IPOs. You'd expect uniform conduct to be alleged. And if there was that sort of conduct and it was alleged to violate both regulatory regimes in a clear way, then maybe it could go forward. Thank you.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, General Clement. Mr. Lovell.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35375 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court's decisions in NASD and National Gerimedical determined that implied immunity is not favored, is justified only by a, quote, "convincing showing of clear repugnancy," and then, quote, "only to the minimum extent necessary," close quote. It is not necessary to make the securities laws work to permit a conspiracy to engage in conduct that the securities laws have been trying to stop since their inception.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35376 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it might well be, because the reasoning would be, which I find very strong, is that as soon as you make an, bring an antitrust court in, you're talking about juries and treble damages. And as soon as that happens, the people who are subject to it stay miles away from the conduct that, in fact, would subject them to liability. And yet staying miles away, they will not engage in conduct that, A, the SEC might believe is permissible, or, B, actually favor. Where you get a complex complaint like yours, that begins to ring true, that argument. And that's what's concerning me.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I totally disagree, with great respect. Our complaint is that the conspiracy was to require laddering in order to develop pools of orders right after the stock began trading.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What they say in respect to that is the other side says it's common to try to what's called make a book or something. I don't know these terms.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And when they do, what happens is that the marketer goes out and he asks people: What's your plan? What are you thinking of doing next month? What's your plan for this stock? Hold it? Not? It doesn't require much imagination to see how certain answers to that kind of question could be brought by a plaintiff in perfectly good faith as evidence that there's an agreement that next month they will pay more for the stock and next month they'll pay a lot more.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not this case, Your Honor. That's not this case. We say that the underwriters made a horizontal conspiracy to inflate the prices and to inflate their charges as a result by requiring these laddering orders and jointly negotiating together the amounts of the laddering.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He's not saying that that's this case. He's just saying that it's so easy to make allegations that action which was perfectly legitimate amounted to action that was illegitimate. And that question ultimately gets thrown into the laps of the jury; and if the jury comes out the wrong way, you get hit with treble damages.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, sorry for interrupting.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm done.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. It's like a lawyer knows what to say and knows what not to say. This has been established for years. You cannot say in the securities business, Your Honor -- and we don't know this; we know what to do as lawyers. You cannot say it's a quid pro quo, I'm going to negotiate with you how much you have to purchase. That type of conduct created pools during the 1920s and the early 30s which manipulated prices to unsustainable levels that led to the great stock market crash and maybe the depression. The legislative history said: We want to stop pools. In section 982 of the Securities and Exchange Act it says, quote, "One person or more cannot work together to raise prices." We allege that the first part of this horizontal conspiracy, across underwriters and across IPOs, was to require the laddering in order to raise prices.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The problem -- I'd be repeating it. we're not talking about, say, your case. I don't know what your evidence is. But let's imagine a case where the evidence of just what you said consists of some rather ambiguous discussions which might be characterized in a variety of ways, including the way the way the plaintiff wants to characterize it, who would repeat the very words you just said. Now, the issue, it seems to me here, is in light of that possibility, do we want an antitrust judge to say whether that's so? I know you do. Or do you want the SEC to say whether that's so in the particular case? Or that's why I thought of primary jurisdiction: Maybe first send it to the SEC. What's your view?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'll do primary jurisdiction last, Your Honor. My view is that to bring in the other case is, in effect, to exculpate antitrust violations. On this narrow case that we've alleged, under Connelly versus Gibson there is no other case. Anybody who's charged with murder or any serious conduct could say: Well, you can't really apply that because this is the other case.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you if your conspiracy allegation would be the same if there were only one underwriter?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. No, Your Honor.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is critical to your case that there are multiple underwriters?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, yes.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What if we thought that the activities of the multiple underwriters were Comparable to a single joint venture? In many respects they're like a joint venture. Would that mean your whole case could collapse? In other words, I'm really wondering to what extent you're depending on your horizontal agreement as opposed to the vertical arrangements like laddering and flipping and that sort of thing.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We totally depend on the horizontal agreement, Your Honor. The case rises or falls on the horizontal agreement among underwriters to require that which the securities law --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If there had just been the vertical agreements and if they had been fully disclosed, there would no antitrust violation, would there? If there had just been publicly disclosed agreement by one underwriter with the purchasers to engage in these activities, there would be no violation, would there?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35395 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If there's no market power, we're not alleging that, and we wouldn't try to bring that case, Your Honor. Where the antitrust laws, as General Clement says, have their reach is that they get the whole elephant. If we prove that the underwriters conspired as we alleged, and there's five administrative complaints here -- it's not something where it's is a strike suit. There's five administrative complaints finding this parallel unlawful conduct, which would work best through a conspiracy. And we have our allegations in the complaint that they worked jointly together to do in this case what's always been prohibited under the securities laws.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35396 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What about the Solicitor General's suggestion about extending antitrust immunity to a single IPO? In other words, what's wrong with that? That's where the SEC's regulation seems to be most pervasive, and what you can do in the context of an IPO if your allegations cut across IPOs that might be different.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35397 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's a hypothetical. We're not trying to do an individual case. I don't have a strong position on it. There is a case called Roth berg in the Eastern District of New York -- the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, a district court case, that recognized an antitrust violation in a single stock manipulation. There are other cases called Shumway and -- and I forget the other case -- that said, no, you can't have it. They've gone both ways. It wouldn't matter to our case at all. We're trying to get at -- the securities laws are transactional. They can't get at a big wrong like this. They only get their own part of the elephant. The antitrust laws, this is business as usual, step into my office. As General Clement says, the antitrust laws come if we prove that there was a horizontal agreement. Then all of these individual efforts --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What are you talking about when you say a horizontal agreement? Are you talking about a group of underwriters in the context of a single IPO?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. It's across IPOs and across underwriters. They changed their business. They all changed the business at about the same time: This is the way we're going to operate. We're going to require the laddering orders. That moves the price up. And we're going to require another type of tie-in agreement that allows the underwriters to participate in the customer's profits from the difference between the IPO price and the inflated prices at which transaction sales were made right after the IPO.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What about an agreement among underwriters, among underwriters, which says the following: We agree that we go -- when we go on our tour, we will be certain to ask the potential purchasers whether they plan to hold this stock for at least a month.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No problem.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No problem.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Never.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How do you know that isn't a disguise when they say --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We wouldn't bring the case, Your Honor.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ah, ah. What they've said was -- you see, they have the same allegations. I don't know how to -- you see what I'm driving at?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. Yes, but --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's the answer?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think it fits into the way of this narrow case and the facts that are presented for immunity here, which the Congress has been trying to stop forever, and the conduct's spread between 1997 and 2001 and was a massive violation that the securities laws really aren't cut out to address. I know I'm getting off your question a little bit, but in the NASDAQ antitrust litigation these defendants and their predecessors agreed to keep the spreads wide in the over-the-counter market. There were rules about maximum spreads. There were many rules, many regulations. However, it was never permitted in the securities markets for all the underwriters across 5,000 stocks -- we only proved it out to 1600 -- to widen their spreads, to keep their bids and offers wide. Billions of dollars -- the Justice Department after we brought the case, the Justice Department brought a case. The entire industry was changed. You can now trade a million dollars worth of stock for less than it costs to change your tire or something. And it's all due to the antitrust -- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm trying to grasp the difference between the single IPO and multiple. So in response to Justice Breyer's hypothetical, they all agree in the context of a single IPO, let's make sure everyone's going to hold the stock for a month, and you say no problem.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No problem.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if the same underwriters get together the next month, they've got a different IPO and they say, you know, let's do the same thing we did last time because seemed to work well in terms of the issuance and the capital formation. All of a sudden that's an antitrust problem?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. The basis for my answer is two levels of no problem. There's not a problem as to the single deal and there's not a problem as to saying you have to hold the stock. That's not at issue. We have no problem with that. What's always been prohibited is to create pools of orders to drive up the price of the stock. If you work to raise the price of the stock, which this was all geared to do, after it came public, it drives prices to unsustainable levels. It creates a lot of action in the stock. People come in and buy. Our clients buy directly from the defendants who are driving the stock up. And yes, there was no disclosure. As with any antitrust conspiracy, if there was disclosure there could have been --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can you get damages for that from the SEC? I mean, it sounds like bad conduct.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The SEC refers the customers to the private lawyers if you complain. The securities laws are totally different from the ICC, from the common carrier case.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose you lose, your client -- suppose all these bad things happen and you don't have an antitrust claim. Is there somewhere in the law that you can get damages?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. Where?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The specific intent of Congress in creating the securities laws was to create private remedies which are available, and to preserve all other remedies, including --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So what's at issue here is not whether you get a remedy. It's whether you get treble damages.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. Theoretically, there are other remedies as to each individual client for what each individual client did. No one can address in a securities case the wrong that happens here. The agreement. That can only be addressed as General Clement says at page 22 of the brief, through an antitrust case.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is that? I don't understand why the SEC could not -- they can make rules for a single IPO; it seems to me they can make rules for coordination of IPO. Why can't they do that?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the SEC could make a rule to prohibit -- to further supplement the protections.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, right.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. They could supplement the prohibitions --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They have chosen not to.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it -- it -- I think it's more institutional that the focus has always been transactional, Your Honor. And the Congress clearly in 982 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 clearly prohibits individual or joint efforts to raise prices, empowers private investors to sue, empowers the SEC to sue --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35430 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There could have been a suit by now but it has never happened.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you -- you could regard the activity of laddering and of making a book on a stock when the -- in the case of a single offering. You could -- you could look upon that as, as an attempt to raise the price. That's what it is, isn't it? An attempt to make sure there's going to be a high enough price for the stock so that it won't flop once it's out there?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In the -- there's huge qualitative differences between certain types of conduct which has always been accepted and was not prohibited in the securities laws and laddering or pools of orders to raise prices and tie-in agreements. The only metaphor I can throw out, Your Honor, is that we know how far we can say and what we can't say, the brokers always know this, until 1997 to 2001 when they -- they changed their underwriting businesses to go -- and we, we allege that they required, induced, solicited -- not that they did things on the way -- close to the line or -- in the, what had always been the accepted area, the world changed. And that change moved into the territory that had -- sorry for hurrying -- that had always been prohibited.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah. And you're saying they did this just -- not in the context of just single IPOs, but that they agreed across IPOs that they would all do this.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, across IPOs and across underwriters, so that --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So that a customer couldn't go to another underwriter for a different deal.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Uh-huh. The customer being the issuer?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. The public customers who have accounts with the underwriters; they're also brokerage firms. If they wanted to get an IPO in what we call class security, the technologies securities, they had to pay --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They'd have to pay the premium.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah. They had to pay these unlawful charges under securities laws, no matter where they went. And in terms of the inextricably intertwined, it is the qualitative difference that stops that. I think behind the Solicitor General and the SEC's proposal is a fear that the syndicates, the underwriters are vulnerable to an antitrust case because they operate together. That's not true. There's never been a case precisely like this; and the underwriters as brokers, as market makers, they operate together and cooperatively all the time. Five years goes by. Seven years goes by. There's no antitrust case --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. So what are the words you use in the opinion, that would separate your case, where it is like price fixing and so forth, to charge them, from the case that they're worried about, which is where the evidence is, to prove the allegation is, really involves activity that could be quite legitimate? Now, now -- what words would I write in the opinion that in your opinion would separate the sheep from the goats?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They agreed to inflate prices in precisely the way the securities laws have always prohibited. They agreed to inflate prices and they agreed to make tie-in agreements that have always been prohibited under the securities laws, to participate in the profits from the inflated prices, which they were not permitted to participate in.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So your test is it has to be prohibited by the securities laws?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. But in this narrow case, it happens to be that the method that they went to, which was always a guaranteed method to drive up prices and to participate, was -- had always been prohibited by the securities laws. It is not the test. The test for the antitrust claim is merely this: they wanted to make an agreement to inflate prices and they wanted to make an agreement to inflate their charges. And if a customer came to this underwriting trust at the time to deal with them, they had to do this type of transaction to inflate the price, and they had to pay the underwriting extra --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What do you say to the -- sort of stepping back from the trees to the forest, to the general suggestion that Congress has been tightening up the requirements for private securities litigation over the past few years; and you're bringing this now as antitrust claims as a way to circumvent Congress's regulation.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That the actual facts show that Congress wanted this claim to be brought. Certain -- Congress is well aware of the NASDAQ antitrust litigation and of the Salomon Brothers antitrust litigation, both antitrust claims in the securities markets. Both situations where the diligent professionals at the SEC were criticized by the congressional oversight people for not finding out what was going on, perhaps, and that the antitrust bar did and brought the case, and then the DOJ brought it and then there was questions.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What about -- what about -- listen to what I'm about to say. I'm thinking of the standard. The standard would be where the allegations are such, where the case is such that -- to go further -- that, one, it is an allegation of a claim of illegality; is price fixing, in price fixing; and it is of longstandingly prohibited under the securities law; and there is evidence to support that, of -- strong evidence to support it, or the evidence in support thereof is not primarily evidence simply of asking the jury to draw inferences from conduct that is protected. Under those circumstances there is no immunity.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Bingo. That -- we live with all that, Your Honor. To quote -- sorry, sorry. (Laughter.)
05-1157 +++$+++ 35449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't know if it's -- I mean, you know -- (Laughter.)
05-1157 +++$+++ 35450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no - but we agree on every one. But to go back --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How could the Court -- how could a court enforce that at the 12(b)(6) stage? Determining whether there's strong evidence of one type or another.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, in this particular case, Your Honor, there's five administrative proceedings that have, that have come forth since we -- we filed first, and there was nothing. And -- but since then there have been a lot of administrative proceedings. I would say that the fact that parallel unusual -- unlawful conduct is occurring in a way that the horizontal people who are doing it inflate their prices at the expense of the public, would satisfy any test.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Look, the question isn't whether it satisfies it. The question is whether you can get rid of this suit at the outset or do you have to go through enormously expensive discovery, which -- which isn't worth the candle.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I think you have -- for the good of the country, I think you have to follow the facts and find out if these people conspired as alleged.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- discovery? Right?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. Sure.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the problem -- the problem is that, of course, these people are to some extent under the securities laws in the business of fixing prices. They get together as a syndicate, a syndicate, and say well, you have to figure out what price we're going to charge for this initial public offering. It looks, if you didn't understand the context, it would look an awful lot like an antitrust violation. And the problem is, I guess, that -- that when you take that type of evidence, the type of evidence you're going to be relying on to show that there's price fixing, it is exactly what the SEC wants the people to do. They want them to get together. They want them to agree on an appropriate IPO price that's going to contribute to capital formation and everything else. And how do you at, as Justice Alito pointed out, at the 12(b)(6) stage, how is a district court supposed to say well, this is the bad price fixing, this isn't the good price fixing?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Again it is the qualitative difference. Everybody knows -- and the SEC does want IPO prices to be fixed, just like in the NASD case, they only wanted one price for the mutual fund shares because people could be disadvantaged. However, everybody also knows under Section 982 and Section 17 of the Securities Act, that you don't go over and rig the after market, not even in one stock, let alone what we allege, across stocks. And with regard to the question earlier, Your Honor, about how Congress --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think you've answered his question.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that you've said that the two were different. His question was how can you tell at the outset, at the 12(b)(6) stage, the difference between those two things that you've mentioned? Sure they're different but -- but the evidence that is only evidence of the one also looks like evidence of the other.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is the particular difference between supporting the price and rigging the aftermarket? I mean, how do we tell that at the 12(b)(6)?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You look, you compare the cases to the language in the complaint. In paragraphs 4 and 5 of the complaint we say that they agreed to require laddering, they agreed to require this. We don't say that they made any -- any hints or legitimate activity. We're held to that burden of proof. You look at the cases, required has always been unlawful. To require a pool of orders to drive up the prices -- always unlawful. And Congress during the 1990s did narrow the securities laws; and they took away treble damages as to RICO, and they stopped resorting to state court, where the standards weren't as stringent as under the PS law -- for class action. However, they knew about these antitrust cases that had saved billions of dollars for consumers. They applauded them. And they reenacted the savings clause that says all rights and remedies are preserved.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How did they applaud them?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they just said that they -- Congress -- that's too strong a statement. The specific Congress people involved were glad that the -- the wrongdoing was uncovered and said as much and wrote to the Attorney General, and the SEC, and said why -- why wasn't it found sooner? But they did not touch these antitrust actions. Number one, they come very infrequently. Number two, they've done great benefit for the securities markets and for the participants in the securities markets, and even for the defendants themselves. They forced the defendants to operate by talent and bring out their best, and not resort to what the problems for the public always is --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The SEC which is the agency charged with supervising those markets, thinks otherwise.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No -- no.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They don't think these, the antitrust actions are good for the securities markets.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The SEC -- and this is the first immunity case before the court where the SEC and the DOJ both are in favor of not having substantive immunity. They both oppose immunity.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that wasn't the SEC's position below, was it?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. No, it was not, Your Honor.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the Justice Department was on one side, the SEC was on the other. Right?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. And --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It looks to me like they split the baby up here. (Laughter.)
05-1157 +++$+++ 35476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I -- that's the only way I can see it. But if Your Honor looks at the questions that the SEC answered to Second Circuit, the SEC said they couldn't say how the current laws couldn't work on the facts of this case, but future cases might present a closer case, Your Honor.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would always -- I think the standard I was more or less talking about is pretty close to what the SG says. And I think he says that -- that -- that Justice Alito's point, which is certainly a good point, is that you would have to allege facts such that it was clear from the face of the complaint that you weren't resting your case on the conduct that was -- that's what he means by protected -- and there's an ongoing obligation, it says, on the part of the district judge to be sure that the case isn't really growing out of this conduct that is arguably okay.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Protected conduct. And we could live with --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You, you could live with the SG --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We could live with that. On the other hand, applied immunity is an affirmative defense. It was held in Cantor versus Detroit Edison, 428 US 579, which didn't make it into our brief, that applied antitrust immunity is an affirmative defense. As we brief, there's a long line of cases from Your Honors that say that you don't have to plead in the complaint to negate an affirmative defense. I don't think that unlawful conduct under the securities laws is entitled to more protection than free speech or some of the conduct in these other cases; and I -- and we've opposed the inextricably intertwined standard as particularly inappropriate where an affirmative defense is involved. Nonetheless, we could live with that, if it came down. And we think the complaint already lives with it. The complaint has, from paragraph 53 through paragraph 63, a number of allegations of joint conduct to do things which are clearly unlawful under the securities laws. It does have one allegation about holding road shows. On its own, that's permissible. We don't have a footnote that says this is permissible on its own. That may have caused somewhat of the problem for -- for people. But reading the complaint as a whole, paragraph 5 says that these later paragraphs I just referred to show how the time in the syndicates was abused. And I'm going back to this vulnerability point. The defendants are vulnerable to an antitrust class action plaintiffs saying, you conspired. Yes. But it only happens -- it only happens once in a while. And think about it. If they abuse their time in the syndicates to create a conspiracy of this nature, to do something that's always been prohibited under the securities laws, and it's clearly prohibited under the antitrust laws, why should we bend over backwards to protect that every five years or seven years? The normal --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You didn't have a chance to answer Justice Breyer's question about primary jurisdiction. Let's get the SEC's views first of whether there is any interference with securities law enforcement.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The public carrier cases, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the sea carriers and the air carriers have had primary jurisdiction as an approach. In order to keep it uniform, they kept the rate and then there would be questions on the rate. So both for administrative discretion and factfinding, the Court said that's their baby, we're going to stay out. The securities laws have always been totally different. The antitrust laws - it was a little bit patterned after the antitrust laws. Section 9(e) is like the antitrust laws, 15 U.S.C. 15. the antitrust laws said we want private attorney generals to go out and sue. The securities laws said we want to give the remedies under this act, new remedies. We want to preserve -- preserve all other remedies, any and all other remedies. The single damages point raised by the defendants in the same section is only a limit on recovery. It's not a limit on the rights and remedies. So the answer to primary jurisdiction is that it's always worked this way, that the private plaintiff is supposed to sue in court. He's expressly empowered under securities laws to sue in court, As he's expressly empowered under the antitrust laws, and the courts have always resolved the issue.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but we haven't had this problem focus before, and isn't primary jurisdiction the most efficient answer to the problem that we've got? In other words, isn't it time to do something different?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I don't believe so, Your Honor. The times that it's come up before in the NASDAQ case, United States versus Morgan, the courts have said business as usual. They used the usual implied immunity standard and they resolve it, as usually happens. In Richey, the Richey case and a few other cases we've either said -- not implied immunity, but we've either said we're not going to get involved, it's the agency's, it's the ICC's responsibility, or it was referred one time in the Richey case to the old Commodity Exchange Commission, which then declined to take the referral because -- that was an appropriate referral because it had to do with the exchange rules.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't understand what happens with this primary jurisdiction in the context of an antitrust suit. You're entitled to a jury trial in the antitrust suit, right?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And in primary jurisdiction, would we refer it to the SEC and accept the SEC's fact determinations and then instruct the jury that --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Never happened before, and it's contrary to the -- what Congress wants. In a different statutory context, it was what Congress wanted for uniformity.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it is really the factual determination that is the hang-up, that you don't want things that are innocent and that the SEC would know are innocent to be taken as evidence of guilty by the jury. So you really haven't accomplished a whole lot if you just send it over to the SEC for rulings on the law as opposed to rulings on whether this particular conduct violated the law.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LOVELL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I agree, Your Honor. I think that the presence here of the SEC complaints, the SEC's fact-finding, saying that things got out of hand during this time and the law was broken on a widespread basis, indicate that we are not coming forth with weak facts. And I also agree that in the securities context, primary jurisdiction has not had the basis it's had in other legislative contexts where uniformity was desired. Thank you.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Lovell. Mr. Shapiro, you have four minutes remaining. STATEMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
05-1157 +++$+++ 35492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The key question in this litigation is who's going to design what a tie-in is and who's going to decide what constitutes unreasonable compensation. The plaintiffs say quite overtly in their briefs these issues can't be left in the hands of the SEC. Well, Congress put these issues in the hands of the SEC. There are three separate provisions that give the SEC power to define what is forbidden manipulation, what is a forbidden tie-in, and what is excessive compensation. The SEC this Court has said is an agency that Congress had considerable confidence in in the Gordon case and that confidence is well justified here.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's your test, Mr. Shapiro?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Our test is the one the Court laid down in those two cases: Is there active supervision or is there pervasive regulation? If the answer is yes to either of those, you ask, is there a potential conflict, and if so immunity applies and the complaint has to be dismissed. And this is true whether you're talking about one IPO or an agreement that cuts across several IPOs, because even in the multiple IPO situation the jury would still have to decide, was that a tie-in or was it something innocent; was it unreasonable compensation or was it something that was proper?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We all agree, say a group of underwriters, that for the next we will insist that every customer, whatever price we charge, will pay 30 percent more for 50 percent more shares next month. Absolutely illegal, isn't it?
05-1157 +++$+++ 35496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-1157 +++$+++ 35497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They write it down, just what I said.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The same circumstances were presented very similar to the NASD in the Invemed case. They had a Three-week trial, 17 experts, and they concluded that those charges were quite permissible considering the whole range of services that were given. Now, if this occurred with concerted action the SEC has power to deal with concerted action. Congress said that they could deal with multiple party manipulations. They have many cases where they proceeded against multiple parties. In the NASD case the claim was that there was a horizontal conspiracy involving many brokers and many underwriters, it was industrywide, it went on for years and years. And the Government argued there it was improper, it was contrary to the SEC's policies this. This Court held squarely that that is within the SEC's power to regulate and if something of that sort is occurring the SEC can deal with it. The test there wasn't whether it was connected to something that was permissible. The test was whether it was connected to the SEC's regulatory responsibilities and the SEC could deal with that sort of concerted action on an industrywide basis. Now, Mr. Lovell has argued that the conduct has always been forbidden. He labels it that way. There are many case from this Court that we cite in our reply brief holding that that labeling does not defeat immunity because it's always possible to characterize conduct in that fashion. But the agency has to apply its expertise to decide what is forbidden and to change its rules over time, which the SEC is now doing. And it has to be able to prevent, deterring conduct that comes up to the line of prohibition. Here that conduct is essential to protect investors and to protect issuers. The markets couldn't function efficiently if underwriters could not engage freely in the kinds of conversations that get twisted in this litigation into something characterized as tie-ins. Now, there are 310 private suits now pending under the securities laws brought by many of these same lawyers, making the same claims of concerted action to manipulate the stock market. Those suits are subject to a panoply of safeguards that Congress has prescribed, including single damages, restrictions on class action abuse, serious loss causation requirements. The only purpose for stretching the antitrust laws here is to evade all of the safeguards that Congress has passed, each and every one of them. We think NASD and Gordon are very important in preventing that kind of a pleading tactic. And of course, when counsel talks about concerted action and manipulating the stock market, what did Congress pass the '34 Act for if it wasn't that? There were extensive hearings about concerted manipulation involving pools and groups that were manipulating the market. That's why there are several anti-manipulation provisions in the '34 Act that give Power to define the misconduct and to deal with it effectively. And this is the toughest cop in Washington, the SEC. They're perfectly capable of dealing with this.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Shapiro.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHAPIRO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We thank the Court.
05-1157 +++$+++ 35501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The case is now submitted.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35506 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in Wallace versus Kato and Roy. Mr. Flaxman.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35508 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case presents the Court with the question it addressed in Heck versus Humphrey raised in a slightly different context. The context in Heck was of a prisoner whose conviction had been affirmed who was in prison, who had filed a civil rights case that would have had the practical effect of collaterally challenging his criminal conviction. The context in this case is of a civil rights plaintiff who has prevailed in his criminal case, who was imprisoned for 8-1/2 years fighting the criminal case and comes to Federal court with a Section 1983 action saying, I now seek a remedy for my unconstitutional incarceration, and files his lawsuit. The court in Heck held that this action, an action to recover damages for unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, accrues when the conviction is set aside. That's the principle that we asked the court of appeals to apply and the court of appeals said: We're not going to apply that because we will adopt a categorical rule without any implied exceptions whatsoever that says when you're arrested you have 2 years, which is the statute of limitations in 1983 cases in Illinois, to file your claim for damages.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Flaxman, one starting point. You say that this case should be just like Heck, but in Heck the core problem was the line between 1983 and habeas, right?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that was one view of the core problem.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35511 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But at least this case involves no such concern about habeas.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. In Heck the Court solves the core problem by concluding -- by denying the existence of a cause of action for damages until the criminal case had been resolved in favor of the civil rights claimant, which is the rule, the common law rule for malicious prosecution. That's the solution that the Court came up with in Heck, which is the solution that the petitioner believes should be applied in this case.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But only if, only if the challenged evidence, the challenge to the evidence, if sustained, would necessarily -- and this is the crucial language -- invalidate the criminal conviction.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's what would have happened in this case, as the dissenting judge in the petition for rehearing --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would necessarily have? You could have said that ex ante?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely. In criminal cases there's discovery and the criminal defendant knows what the prosecution --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You don't know what other evidence there might have been in the criminal case. Ex ante you can't tell.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You do know because it's disclosed in discovery. We don't do trial by ambush any more in criminal cases. The defendant knew that all the evidence against him was the alleged --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but he did not know that for years later. I mean, they don't have to bring a prosecution immediately. They can wait until the day before the statute of limitations runs.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there is no statute of limitations for murder in Illinois.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, then they can wait a long time. (Laughter.)
05-1240 +++$+++ 35522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If he's incarcerated that whole time awaiting the filing of charges, then his cause of action would not have accrued. But the more likely scenario is that he would be arrested --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, is that -- I mean, your friend on the other side says that the cause of action would have accrued at the moment at which he was bound over by the decision of an independent magistrate. At that point the false arrest and the incarceration incident to the false arrest is over and if there is ever going to be a claim for what happens next, I gather it'ss going to be a common law action for false imprisonment, and that, I guess, would not accrue until the imprisonment is over. But so far as the arrest is concerned, whatever whatever wrong is done, that wrong is completed at the point at which an independent magistrate takes over.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the claim was solely directed at the arrest, then Your Honor would be absolutely correct. The claim in this case, the cause of action, is not that he was taken off the street without probable cause. The core of the cause of action is that the respondent police officers exploited that arrest to get this untruthful confession that was used to hold Mr. Wallace in custody for 8-1/2 years, to seize him for 8-1/2 years. It's not just the arrest. It's the arrest plus exploiting it.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But all of that occurred, as I -- correct me if I'm wrong on the facts, but I thought all of that occurred prior to -- I don't know what they call it in Illinois, but prior to a bind-over hearing or prior to the point at which the judiciary steps in, breaking the, as it were, the chain of causation between what the police do and the subsequent incarceration.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under Malley versus Briggs, it doesn't break the chain of causation if we adhere --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but just as a factual matter is it correct -- is it correct as a factual matter that the confession that was given was a confession that was given before there was any judicial intervention, before he was brought before a magistrate?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There was no other evidence presented to the magistrate or that could have been presented to the magistrate other than the confession to show --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Mr. Flaxman, is your argument limited to that situation, where there is no evidence whatsoever against the criminal defendant other than the illegally seized evidence? Or would it apply in some situations in which there is some additional evidence?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If there's some additional evidence, we could not say was necessarily -- would necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction. And would be -- that's not our situation.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Any additional evidence, even if it would be insufficient to support a conviction, takes -- makes make this -- would make this a different case.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would not say -- well, it would make it a different case. But if I was arguing in a case where there was a little bit of evidence, but not enough to say there's probable cause to accuse him of a crime, I would say that suppressing or eliminating the confession would necessarily imply the invalidity of any conviction.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What, what does necessarily mean? Does it mean no additional evidence? Does it mean no additional evidence that is insufficient to support a conviction? Does it mean no additional evidence that would be likely to persuade a trier of fact?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What I think it means is that there's no conviction -- what I think it should mean -- and I'm not trying to debate the dictionary, what I think it should mean is that if there is no evidence other than after -- that is excluded, to base a prosecution on, as in this case where the man is let go, because there is no evidence to prosecute him, that that does imply the invalidity of the conviction.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in this case, let me just me more question on it. In this case, suppose there had been a witness who said at about the time when this murder took place, I saw somebody who was between, I would judge as between the age of 15 and 25, average height, average build, running away. And let's say that your client fits that description. Now would that be enough to take this case out of the rule that you're arguing for?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. Unless that witness could say and the man who I saw then is the defendant in this -- is the criminal defendant, Mr. Wallace. There was an eyewitness in this case. And he could not make an in-court identification of Mr. Wallace. And the prosecutor realized that that wasn't enough evidence on which to base a criminal prosecution, and gave up.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Again, you didn't, you didn't know that at the time the arrest was made, or at the time the confession was extorted, or at the time he was bound over. You really didn't know that until the trial. For all you knew, they might have found in addition to the confession, they might have found eyewitnesss who would have identified your client. You couldn't tell that until the trial.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that would have been very unfair if they withheld -- they ambushed the defendant with --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, well -- until the trial --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Until the trial, until the process of trial began.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we didn't know that because there weren't any, because this man didn't commit that crime. We are talking -- in the hypothetical, I think we should set, start with Mr. Wallace being an innocent man, who was arrested unlawfully, who gives an involuntarily -- an involuntary false confession. And on the basis of that is held for eight and a half years, finally wins the case, is set free, and then sues the --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, but you presume in your last answer that other than that, there is an absolutely fair prosecution.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Other than the fact --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, why do we make that assumption when we start out with the allegation of a tort and a violation of the Constitution? I don't understand.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the tort is against the police officers who made an unlawful arrest and exploited it to get the evidence that was used to hold Mr. Wallace. The, the problem with saying that Mr. Wallace has to sue, as soon as he files his motion to suppress, he should have filed his Section 1983 action, would produce a multitude of 1983 actions.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What about the fact -- suppose that there were even a more serious battery here, a broken limb or something. Would you have to sue for the damages for the battery right away? The police officers injured --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. If excessive force was used against somebody when they're being arrested, that's a claim that everyone agrees accrues at the time of the injury.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what about this case?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This case would necessarily impair the validity of the conviction. If --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the conviction in Heck existed at the time of the alleged tort. And what Heck said is where you have an outstanding conviction, and you have a constitutional tort, you can't sue on that constitutional -- and where -- you cannot sue on that constitutional tort if the decision on the tort would effectively contradict your conviction. Until the conviction has been set aside. Well, this is not that situation. There was no outstanding conviction involved. So why did you have to wait?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you had to wait because it would -- it would be a fruitless act to file the case while the case -- file a Federal case while the state criminal case was pending. But --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm still, I'm still puzzled about my question. Suppose there's a battery resulting in a serious injury to the defendant.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That claim would --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNED +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there's other evidence and so forth. Can you sue for the battery at once?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You can sue and you have to sue for the battery immediately.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why is that the situation?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why is that different? Because this --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- or is it just because of the assumption that the conviction might stand anyway.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well the conviction generally does stand with -- the battery generally has nothing to with the conviction.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35562 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if does, then you wait?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If it is an element of the offense, you wait. Or if it is an element of what could be the defense in a criminal case. But getting back to the Heck question, in Heck the court looked to the common law for the appropriate rule to apply to the cause of action that Mr. Heck was applying. If we look to the common law for the appropriate rule for Mr. Wallace, we don't come up with the Seventh Circuit's rule of immediate accrual. We come up with the rule --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the point, the whole point of Heck was to avoid 1983 becoming an end run around habeas. But here you don't have that problem because you don't have any available relief under habeas under Stone versus Powell.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35565 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we don't know before the criminal case starts whether Mr. Wallace will receive a full and fair hearing on his Fourth Amendment claim. And until we know that we don't say Stone versus Powell would bar a Fourth Amendment claim. We don't know that the state will give Mr. Wallace an attorney who can stay awake, who can file a motion, who knows that there is a Fourth Amendment, and Mr. Wallace might end up not getting a full and fair hearing and might have a valid claim cognizable with Federal habeas corpus that --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35566 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are there many cases in which the rule of Stone versus Powell is inapplicable for that reason?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35567 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. But there are some. It is not a non-existent occurrence in.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What happens -- I'm trying to think of what the problem is for you. On January 1, your client's arrested unlawfully. Now suppose the rule was you have two years to file it, starting now. What is the problem for you? The problem is maybe in a year, or maybe less, the police start to prosecute him. In the meantime, your trial is going forward because you filed it on time. So when they start to prosecute him, you don't yet know what's going to happen. And it could happen that he's convicted and you think it's illegal because of the arrest and necessarily so. And therefore you have to stop the trial, I guess, because of Heck.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The civil trial will be stayed pending the --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That would work, I guess. They'd stop it and then they'd have to bring it -- you'd have to stop it and then you'd have to go through these other remedies and they you'd have to go back to it.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would be on the district court's docket for ten years waiting the final --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that would work.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would, well, it would be a horrible --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A mess.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- a horrible mess for the district court. It would not work because --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose I modify it.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why would it be a mess? I mean, it seems to me that the district court, once it is filed -- something is filed within the two year statute, the district court can tell virtually immediately whether there are criminal proceedings that are yet to be held, and the district court can simply, it can simply stay further proceedings until those criminal proceedings are over. If there's a possibility of collateral attacks, the district court can simply say hey, are you going to file a collateral attack? And if the answer is yes, stay it further. If the answer is no, go ahead with it then. What's tough about that?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the district judge will not allow a civil case to go forward because it would allow the criminal defendant --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the premise of my question. But I mean it seems to me to be fairly easily administered.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I mean, I, I shudder to think of 20,000 cases on district court dockets being stayed while criminal cases are being resolved.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 20,000 might make me shudder. But we got one. (Laughter.)
05-1240 +++$+++ 35582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We have one. The criminal defendant will be disinclined to file his civil rights case on time because it will be used against him in his criminal case to impeach his bias.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- explain that.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It will impeach his bias. If he, when he testifies in the criminal case, he will be cross-examined, aren't you seeking money damage from the police officers? Don't you want to make money from this case? And the jury will consider that when they weigh the truthfulness of the --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And don't you think that a civil action which necessarily has to be stayed, might be a basis for, for the court in the criminal case to limit that kind of cross-examination?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not in the Circuit Court of Cook County. That cross-examination will occur every time a civil --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are there appeals from the Circuit Court of Cook County?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There are appeals and.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, don't you -- don't you think ultimately you could get that issue resolved?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I am absolutely confident the Illinois courts at the highest level will say that is proper cross-examination.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Come -- come back here. (Laughter.)
05-1240 +++$+++ 35592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose it is complicated. I want to suggest a modification with this suit here. You say you have to file within two years. But wait, you have -- we tolled the statute. If the person is arrested and charged, and convicted, for all the time that is going on, it is just tolled, equitably. And after the conviction, if he's acquitted, by the way, or he isn't arrested, the statute starts to run again. Now if he's convicted, as long as you have filed, proceeding to challenge the conviction, it is tolled. Now, would that -- that it seems to me would help every problem you have, and it would be called equitable tolling. And that's been suggested by judges in different forums and many states have it. And what's the problem? That just solves the problem, doesn't it?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I have four answers. I hope I can get them out. If Heck instead of adopting a rule of accrual and denying existence of a cause of action had established the Federal tolling rule, saying that these causes of action are tolled while you're in custody, that would have solved the problem.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right, well, we could do it in this case.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I, I -- the Court certainly can do it. It would require carving a hole into, into Tomiano with this --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yeah, it would require overruling our cases that say for tolling, your borrow state law --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What cases require overruling?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Unless state law is inconsistent with Federal Board of Regents versus Tomiano, I think the Court could say that. The other thing that the Court should be aware of is that the Seventh Circuit, and I think four other circuits follow the common law rule that you can't have a 1983 action about a false arrest if you have been convicted of the charge on which you were arrested. So these cases would not be brought in the Seventh Circuit and the --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it seems to me identical to the rule you are advocating but with one difference. The difference with the rule you are advocating is a judge who is going to be judge at time A with your first case, is going to have to guess whether it is in this case or not in this case necessarily related to some kind of challenge to conviction you're going to bring later if you happen to get convicted.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is no way to guess that.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think tolling, a Federal tolling rule for this cause of action, while someone in custody although a criminal conviction is, has not been resolved in favor of the defendant, criminal defendant, would be an excellent solution.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And is there anything that you are aware of that it would be contrary to? I know there are cases that say you look to states but you only look to states where the state law is, in fact, consistent with the Federal right.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I think the Court could say without overruling anything that there, in this the state law does not fully reflect or protect the Federal rights at stake here.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So then you deny the officers the purpose you have for the reason you have statutes of limitation, which is repose. They are going to wait ten years instead of the two years to find out if they are going to have to answer any claim for damages.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but the officers will also get the benefit of not being sued if there is a conviction based on the charge for which the person was arrested. That case would not be brought, especially in the Seventh Circuit where there is no cause of action -- and it wouldn't be brought anywhere because there's no damages if you are arrested and properly convicted and serving sentence. Those cases just are not going to exist; the officers would have that benefit.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought the Seventh Circuit said in -- quickly in passing that the damages would run only from the time of the allegedly unlawful arrest until the time of arraignment. That would, that would be the -- be all of your damages. If there wasn't an arraignment, whatever happens is not attributed to the seizure.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the Seventh Circuit's view about what the cause of action is, which goes back to what is the cause of action and when does it accrue? In the Seventh Circuit the cause of action starts when you're arrested and -- either at the time of arraignment of, as they said in a subsequent case, when there's a Gerstein probable cause hearing. In I think every other circuit, the cause of action doesn't end at the time of arraignment. It continues until the time that you're released from being in custody.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You asked us to take that case and we didn't.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I asked you to consider damages but I think -- as a question of damages, and there are many issues related to damages that would have been presented in question to --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35611 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if that's the boundaries of the false arrest claim, then why does one happen later matter?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35612 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the common law false arrest claim would allow damages up until the time you were released from the imprisonment, which is not at the time of --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35613 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Even on the basis of innocence?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35614 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not for a false arrest. As long as you're not convicted. So malicious prosecution, you would --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35615 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The common law would give damages in a case like this in which the release was basically governed by a suppression which has nothing to do one way or the other with the innocence of that person?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. The common law element -- malicious prosecution requires that the innocence or grounds not consistent with guilt, but there's no such element in the common law false imprisonment, which would accrue when you are released from being in prison, which would benefit Mr. Wallace in this case. When the Seventh Circuit talked about there are three alternatives that we have to choose from, the proof immediately, the case by case of when it accrues, or it only accrues at the end of the case, they didn't consider the fourth possibility of the common law rule that it occurs when the imprisonment ends.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What does somebody like Mr. Wallace do under your rule if he's in a jurisdiction where there's not a lot of discovery in criminal cases. He isn't going to know until trial whether his cause of action accrued sometime earlier or whether it waited.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35618 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But he's not going to file his civil rights claim until his criminal case is over, because he knows and his lawyer will tell him, that's going to hurt you in winning the criminal case, and you should be concerned about that.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35619 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But he's never going to know, in the case where there's no statute of limitations, he's never going to know when his criminal case is going to be over because he may never know when it's going to start.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35620 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if Mr. Wallace had been arrested and released, he would have had two years from when he was released to bring a civil rights action, that being false imprisonment
05-1240 +++$+++ 35621 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So what happens if he files a suit after one year and then after one year and 350 days he's prosecuted? His action accrued but then it didn't accrue?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35622 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I would suggest that it would be the same as when someone is convicted of battery, and then 10 years later, the victim of the battery dies from the injury caused by the battery. There would be a second prosecution for murder that would not be barred from double jeopardy. I think that's Diaz versus United States. I think --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35623 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So his action accrued and maybe it's even over, but then it turns out when they bring the prosecution, it should have never have been brought because it never accrued.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I think he would have two actions. He'd have the action for being arrested and then he'd have the action later when the -- when he was seized because of the unlawful -- the fruits of the unlawful arrest. As a practical matter, though, those cases are going to arise even less frequently than the Stone versus Powell cases that are brought properly in Federal habeas corpus.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That problem is solved too if you simply say bring it, day one, you are arrested, and if in fact before the statute of limitations expires, your client is brought to the court and is going to be prosecuted. Tolled. They don't need two actions.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A Federal tolling rule would solve these problems.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I want to be sure I understood your position with regard to Justice Kennedy's hypothetical where the defendant is arrested and excessive force is used by the police, they beat him up or something like that. When does that cause of action accrue?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At the time they beat him up, unless the beating up relates to an element of the offense.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose that they had beat him up two or three times. The first time it didn't relate to it, but then they took him into the interrogation room and they beat him up again. What about that case?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the beating up is -- if the beating up is related to, used to extort a confession and the confession is used against him, then there would be a cause of action when the confession is used.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So there would be two causes of action?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Multiple causes, yes. There could be at least two.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would he have to sue on the first one right away?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you want to get damages for being beaten up, I would tell my client to sue right away. I would also tell my client if he's being charged with a serious criminal crime offense, to wait until the criminal case is over, because it will hurt you.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Flaxman, before you save your time, I didn't understand why you're content with Justice Breyer's tolling situation, bearing in mind that the way he put it is, so long as the -- as the criminal case is commenced within the two-year statute of limitations, how does that help you when the statute of limitations has passed? Then there's no tolling.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But criminal cases are not commenced many, many years after the unlawful arrest, as a practical matter.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And two years doesn't seem to be unheard of.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if we're talking about complicated financial crimes, that's not unusual.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're willing to let those people go?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If we're talking about the kinds of crimes that are involved with this kind of, with street crime, with murder, armed robbery, rape, the defendant is not allowed to let them run over two years.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Those are the only defendants you are concerned about?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Those are the defendants who get unlawfully arrested and are forced to give confessions. If I may reserve my time?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Flaxman. Ms. Solomon.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35645 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our submission this morning rests on the proposition that the victim of an unreasonable search or seizure has the right to sue as soon as that Fourth Amendment violation occurs. For purposes of accrual of that claim, it does not matter whether the victim is subsequently prosecuted or whether he is subsequently convicted. Accordingly, petitioner's Fourth Amendment claim accrued for purposes of the two-year statute of limitations as soon as his unlawful arrest and detention occurred, and his lawsuit filed some nine years later is time barred. The claim accrued --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask, just to get it straight at the beginning, what if the claim includes a Fifth Amendment claim for extorting a conviction and it's mixed up with a Fourth Amendment claim? What about that claim?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I believe that the rule for the Fifth Amendment claim, I believe the Court's view in Chavez is that a coerced confession claim has as an element of the claim, the use of that claim at trial. So it would be our view if that is an element of the claim, that that claim would not accrue until trial. A claim --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What about the beating of the defendant?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Exactly. A claim for conscience shocking techniques to obtain the confession or the excessive force to obtain the confession, both of those claims, and use of the confession at trial is not an element of those claims, and those claims would accrue at the time of those acts, just like the Fourth Amendment rule that we urge in this case. Only where there is a trial right and use of some evidence at trial, suppression of evidence at trial, something of that order, if the trial right is implicated, that claim would not accrue until at trial. That is different from the Fourth Amendment claim, of course, because --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Miss Solomon, do I gather from your response to Justice Stevens about the Fifth Amendment claim, that under Chavez it wouldn't accrue until it is used at trial, is this case therefore a pleading slip on petitioner's part? That is, if he had alleged a Fifth Amendment claim based on the coerced confession, then he wouldn't have a statute of limitations problem?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He brought two claims in his criminal case. He lost them both in the Illinois Circuit Court at the time of his suppression motion. He pursued only one of those on appeal to the Illinois Appellate Court, and the circuit court made findings that the confession was voluntary. So at the outset, there were problems with that claim going into Federal court.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a puzzling feature of it, too, because I thought at the end the second time around, the Court of Appeals held that the confession was no good.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The Illinois Appellate Court overturned the conviction on the basis that it was obtained through use of a confession in violation of the Fourth Amendment only. The only findings that have ever been made regarding Mr. Wallace's confession, the voluntariness of the confession, were made in the Illinois Circuit Court, and the finding was that the confession was voluntary, that it was not coerced. That finding has never been reviewed. Petitioner did file both Fourth and Fifth Amendment claims in this civil case, but we did not assert statute of limitations to the Fifth Amendment claim for precisely the reasons that I indicated to Justice Stevens. And for that reason, although the question was presented in the petition, we did not acquiesce in the Fifth Amendment portion of question 1 of the petition, and the court did not grant the Fifth Amendment claim. So I do not believe -- a short answer, sorry -- I do not believe it was a pleading error. It is simply that that claim as the litigation developed is not before this Court now, but not through a simple pleading error. It is a far more weighty problem than that.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if the Fifth Amendment claim were before us, do I understand you to have said before that the Fourth Amendment claim of false arrest would also be subject to litigation as part of the Fifth Amendment claim or under the umbrella of the Fifth Amendment claim, so that the statute would not have run on that?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. If I indicated that, I definitely misspoke. In our view, all Fourth Amendment claims except for those that do negate an element of the offense, and those are described in footnote 6 of Heck, with that exception, all Fourth Amendment claims should be regarded as accruing at the time that the act that actually violates the Fourth Amendment occurs.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well then, my question is going to be along the same lines. Suppose -- I assume this is a rather frequent case -- the confession is alleged to be the product of a beating. The two are merged. If we have to wait for the Fifth Amendment claim anyway, then as a matter of policy, matter of convenience, why don't we wait for the Fourth Amendment as well?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because the rule of accrual is that the act -- the claim accrues when the plaintiff experiences an injury.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we're making up the rule of accrual, Ms. Solomon. I'm asking, if we have to wait for one, why not wait for the other?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, with respect, Justice Kennedy, I don't believe the Court is making up a rule of accrual. I think those rules are quite well settled. Cases like Ricks and Chardon make clear, and the Fourth Amendment cases make clear that a Fourth Amendment violation, unlike the Fifth, where evidence is used at trial, the Fourth Amendment claim violation is fully accomplished at the time of the illegal search or seizure. Anything --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Who is the defendant in a Fifth Amendment claim? Is it the policemen who extracted the confession or is it the prosecutor who introduced it at trial, since that is the offense?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the prosecutor would be absolutely immune, of course.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And some of those cases are brought against the police officers. But, the reasons that would suggest a certain accrual date for the Fifth Amendment claim are very different from the reasons that dictate the accrual of the Fourth Amendment claim at the time -- the only action the petitioner alleges violated the Fourth Amendment in this case was when his detention at the police station, which was consensual at the outset, became unconsensual, became involuntary at some point before he confessed.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if he had also brought a Fifth Amendment claim, your view as I take it would be as follows: Number one, his Fourth Amendment claim, the running of the statute, the Fourth Amendment claim would be unaffected by that, so that would have to have been brought within the two-year period.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Number two, I'm assuming, and this is what I want you to tell me whether my assumption is right -- I am assuming that if a Fifth Amendment claim were brought by -- no, strike the assumption. You, I take it, would -- let me ask a different question. I take it you would agree that so long as a criminal case was pending, that it would be sensible and maybe required for the court simply to abstain from any proceedings on the Fourth Amendment claim.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do -- our position is that they do occur when they happen and they must be filed within the limitations, yes.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you would agree that the court, if there's a criminal case going on, I take it you would agree that the court should not proceed to trial in the 1983 action.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If there is a Fourth Amendment claim being raised in the criminal case, and of course, it might not be, but that is a very easy --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that's the problem. I don't know if it is easy. It seems to me if you take your point of view, now, on January 1, some, let's call it an unconstitutional action allegedly. So, I don't want to distinguish for the moment between Fourth and Fifth. On January 1 the event occurs. Then you say you have two years to file your claim in the Federal court of a violation of 1983, for example. Then that happens. Let's say two months later they file it. The defendant files it. A month after that, there is a state criminal proceeding. Now, you're the Federal judge. What's supposed to happen? It sounds to me as if the judge sitting there, under your theory, is going to have to make a decision. He's going to have to say now, is the kind of claim that's being argued in my court that the policemen did something unconstitutional, if I say that's correct, that the plaintiff wins, I have to go on to say does the correctness of that, there was a violation, mean that the conviction if there is a conviction in the state court later, will necessarily be vitiated. If the answer to that question is yes, he shouldn't go ahead; is that right?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, that is correct.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. If that's correct, we're getting to exactly the same problem, whether we do it through a set of abstention rules, which we have to have Federal abstention rules or it won't be worked out properly, or we have to have Federal tolling rules. I don't see any way to get to a sensible result here without either having clear abstention rules, just as you say, having clear tolling rules, as I suggested before. Am I right? If I'm wrong, let me know why; and if I'm right, which do you prefer?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think those are essentially the two choices, with one caveat. We would call it an accrual rule as opposed to a tolling rule, for the reason that this court has always respected the tolling rules that states have whereas accrual is a Federal question. But with that slight caveat, I do believe that those are the two main options. But I don't believe the Court should be indifferent as between them. There are very serious practical reasons weighing down on our rule, which is a rule of immediate accrual and filing not immediately, of course -- the case need only be filed within the period of the statute of limitations. Thereafter it might well be that some cases, maybe many cases, maybe nearly all cases, would need a stay of some sort while the Federal -- excuse me -- while the criminal case is ongoing. But that question, figuring out whether a stay is warranted in order to avoid interference with a ongoing state prosecution, is far easier to figure out than whether the evidence is the only evidence, whether it's critical evidence, whether there was other evidence.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I suppose -- correct me if I'm wrong -- when the district court wants to determine if he should hold something in abeyance, this is not necessarily abstention; this is what courts always do when there are multiple actions. Other action pending is a general ground for a court to stay its hand.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's exactly right, Justice Kennedy, and it's also --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I suppose it would make a difference to the officers, a principle of equitable tolling. They don't know if they're going to be sued for 10 years, 12 years, however long. Under an accrual rule with a stay, they know whether they're going to be facing a civil action or not.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is the second major advantage that we see to our rule, Chief Justice Roberts.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you do it with a stay, I mean, I see that disadvantage. If you do it with a stay, the Federal judge is going to have to sit there with the papers in front of him, look at that evidence, think what's going to happen in the trial at the criminal case which I'm not quite certain yet, and then make a determination. It sounds like a very difficult decision and it sounds like sometimes they'll get it wrong, sometimes they'll get it right. The defendant might be arguing two different things, you know, one in the state court to try to get them to go ahead, and the other to try to get them to go ahead in the Federal court. What do you --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Accepting your earlier construct where there really are essentially two rules, we either delay accrual or we --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you delay accrual by tolling, you do have the disadvantage that in some instances the policemen won't know for quite a while whether the case is being brought. That's true; and in the other instance, he won't know for quite a while how the case is going to come out, which may be worse. But you don't have any uncertainty. You have no uncertainty. You would know once the man is released. It's no tolling. Once he's convicted, it's tolled. Then the conviction comes in. Not tolled until they bring a proceeding.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The rule that we propose, which is immediate accrual coupled with a stay of some sort if the Fourth Amendment claim is being actively litigated in the state court at that time, has two advantages. The first is that it does serve the purposes that all statutes of limitations serve, which is it puts the defendant on notice you are now the defendant in a lawsuit, you should be marshalling your evidence, you should be preserving your records, and you are not in repose. This Court has respected those as very important interests. They are absolutely not served by a rule of delayed accrual. At the same time, the rule to allow a stay where necessary - as I indicated, it's not going to be all of the cases, and it's far easier to figure it out. The Federal district court figures it out by having the defendant, the criminal defendant, who is a plaintiff in his court, come in and is asked a question: Are you currently --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're not going to waste a lot of time figuring out whether to grant a stay or not when you have a criminal prosecution pending in state court. I think in most cases -- I mean, it's not like they're looking for cases. They're going to say in most cases: Stay granted, come back when this is over. They don't have to be -- unlike perhaps the situation with an equitable tolling rule, it doesn't matter whether they're precisely right or wrong. I mean, if it's close enough just stay it, and it doesn't seem to me there's much prejudice from that.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's correct, Your Honor, and we wouldn't have any objection to a rule that --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But isn't there this practical problem? I think what you say fits together beautifully with regard to the law, but isn't it true that this will give an incentive in every criminal case for the defendant to file a 1983 action. So we may multiply the number of Federal cases that are filed and then sit there while a criminal case proceeds.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the assumption, Your Honor, should be that the number of cases is going to be the same either way. It's just a question of when are they filed and, moreover --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if your opponent's rule is adopted, they wouldn't file unless -- if they get convicted and the conviction stands up, the case would never be filed.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's curious that they make that argument, because of course every victim of a Fourth Amendment violation has the right to damages for at least the invasion of their privacy, for the antecedent conduct between the time of arrest and charging. At a minimum, Mr. Wallace had that coming to him because he was, according to the Illinois appellate court, illegally seized.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The thing I just want you to comment on is, my thought is every person arrested has a potential, and something follows and so forth, has a potential Fourth Amendment claim, even though he may not have one on the merits. It just seems to me that there's a potential here of an awful lot of what may turn out to be frivolous claims filed, but it would seem to be routine procedure for defense lawyers who want to make a suppression motion to say, well, I better file my 1983 case at the same time. So you might get literally hundreds and hundreds of cases.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With respect, Your Honor, we'll take that chance for the benefits that the statute of limitations does bring to the officer. And as far as the burden on the court, whether all cases are stayed or some cases are stayed, of course, we're content to have this Court or the district court handling the case figure that out. But the main point that I would make is that a rule of delayed accrual wholly undermines the purposes of the statute of limitations, and where the plaintiff's interest, the claimant's interests, can be served, as I indicated, at a minimum every victim of a Fourth Amendment violation has the right to some damages. That is actually precisely why we say that Fourth Amendment claims do not necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I had missed Mr. Flaxman's point that this would an advantage to the prosecutor to say, aren't you going to make a lot of money about this case? My initial reaction as the defense counsel, I would love that comment. I would tell the jury: Of course, it's our duty as counsel to point out that my client was beaten, he was terrified, he was beaten again, he had a false confession, and the damages we're not interested in; we'll get much more damages if you convict and we show this 15 years later because the policemen lied as they always do. You know, you hear it.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It may be not in a --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But he has tried more of these cases than I have and he indicates this is a serious concern.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He has tried way more of them than I have as well, and I can't speak to that specifically. It's not an argument that was ever made in the briefs. But again, I have no reason to believe that the Federal district court can't take account of whatever it needs to take account of in order to avoid --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. This is the Cook County. This is the Cook County court.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. Yes, I understand. But all that has to happen, of course, is that the complaint be put on file in the Federal court. It's notice pleading. It can be a very, very long complaint.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but he says the fact of the complaint the prosecutor's going to use in order to show that they're trying to profit from a false claim of a beating.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but as I indicated, every victim of a Fourth Amendment rights, even those who are guilty, even those who are convicted -- that's the Herring case. Herring exactly shows --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but the point is if the complaint is filed then the prosecution can makes that point.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would imagine that it would cut both ways in many cases, Your Honor. I'm sorry, I can't speak to it more specifically than that.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does your position in this case leave any reason at all for equitable tolling?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does, Your Honor, absolutely. Equitable tolling is always available in an extraordinary case when the plaintiff could not put a complaint on file within the period of the statute of limitations. And unlike the accrual question, as indicated a moment ago, the tolling is governed by the states. In this case, for example, because Mr. Wallace was only 15 years old at the time of the arrest, his claim was tolled. He actually had nearly four years beyond the two-year statute of limitations to put a complaint on file and it still would have been toll -- would have been timely. He filed outside even that time. Illinois does not toll for prisoners, but many states do, as the Court indicated in the Hardin case. So there's all sorts of tolling available, or could be under state law. Mr. Wallace has actually never urged tolling in this case and I assume that that's because there is no basis for that under state law. He did get the advantage already of the time when he was a minor and there is no other basis under Illinois law that would allow him any basis for tolling. But of course, tolling is proper when the plaintiff does not know and could not know that his rights were violated. If Mr. Wallace was illegally seized, he was right there when it happened. He might not have known that a court would ultimately accept his argument on that, but of course the plaintiff never has a right to be told that he has a successful claim before he brings that claim.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there any remedy that Illinois law provides for a case like this where a person spends, what was it, eight years in prison and is ultimately released because the state never had enough evidence to try him in the first place?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In many cases, the state law of malicious prosecution will provide a remedy. Of course, in Illinois and in all states, it requires favorable termination. In this case, of course, petitioner conceded long ago that he cannot show favorable termination because the circumstances under which the criminal case ended did not -- were not consistent with a favorable termination. But, of course, he would have had a Fourth Amendment claim if he had filed it timely. He would have had a state law malicious prosecution claim if he had been able to show favorable termination. In states that don't have malicious prosecution, perhaps there would be a due process claim as well. The result that there are no damages available to somebody when the conviction is overturned solely by operation of the exclusionary rule, however, should not be troubling because the conviction itself, of course, was not an independent violation of the Constitution. Petitioner did receive the benefit of the exclusionary rule. His conviction was overturned. We're not aware of any case indicating that deterrence purposes would require both the exclusion of evidence and a damages claim.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would it ever be proper for a district court to insist on proceeding to the merits of the claim, to dispose of the merits of the claim, while the prosecution was pending? Suppose the district court thought that it was seeing too many of these claims and it wanted to get to the bottom of them?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, in our experience the district courts don't tend to want to go ahead. But I would suppose that if the -- if the court did, rules of comity are sufficient to allow the state courts to have the first crack at issues that are arising in the criminal cases, to be the ones that --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We haven't written about that other than in Heck explicitly and implicitly, and in Younger? That's about it?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In Heck and in Younger. There's the concurrence in Deacons against Monahan indicates that a claim for damages should be stayed and not dismissed or gone forward with. Justice White's concurrence specifically addressed the difference between dismissing and going forward with the claim. Of course, the footnotes 8 and 9 in the Heck opinion are very powerful indications of the weighty reasons. We have no reason to think that the district court would want to charge ahead with a claim that would -- with a case that will only get simpler if it waits for the state court proceedings to conclude, as well as of course the comity and respect for the state courts. In this case, of course, as I mentioned, the -- Mr. Wallace always had a claim available to him for his initial seizure regardless of the outcome of his criminal prosecution. If he wanted to seek damages for that prosecution and our primary submission, part one of our brief is even assuming those damage might be available on a Fourth Amendment claim, he was nevertheless obligated to bring that claim within the period of the statute of limitations, because otherwise it would be time barred. In our view, petitioner does not have one claim for that arrest and another claim for his trial and prosecution. He has one claim for a Fourth Amendment violation with two elements of damages. But mounting future or delayed damages do not delay accrual. Even where the plaintiff does not know the full extent of his injuries, he still must sue within the period of the statute of limitations. In fact, petitioner does not cite a single case including the ones newly arrived in the reply brief that uses either his accrual rule or his damages rule to award damages for the entire time of a lengthy period of incarceration. And as I indicated petitioner conceded long ago that he cannot show favorable termination. And although he could have obtained some damages had he brought his claim timely, his claim did accrue he was seized and not when the charges --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you agree with Judge Wood that the limitation on damages would be from the period, from the time of the arrest until the arraignment? That would be the measure and nothing after?
05-1240 +++$+++ 35709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SOLOMON +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ A number of courts have reached that result, Your Honor. Footnote 25 recites five court of appeals decisions to that effect. But our primary submission in this Court is that regardless of the damages that are available on a Fourth Amendment claim, that the mounting of damages did not delay accrual, and without a timely claim, it doesn't matter what damages the plaintiff is seeking. The reference in Heck to a claim for damages for unconstitutional conviction, we take to be a shorthand for a claim of some sort of constitutional violation that can be brought through the vehicle of Section 1983 that would enable the plaintiff to recover damages for the incarceration. 1983 of course itself does not create any substantive rights. The plaintiff needs an underlying claim and in this case of course the plaintiff only has the Fourth Amendment claim. We do have, in our brief and argument why the Fourth Amendment should not be regarded as allowing those damages, but our primary submission and we do think the Court can decide the case without -- without reaching that issue. The only date to delay an accrual in this case was the date that the charges were nol prossed. But that date is meaningless for the Fourth Amendment and it is therefore meaningless for accrual. We would the judgment be affirmed.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Ms. Solomon. Mr. Flaxman, you have four minutes remaining.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35712 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The issue that has been sitting in this case like the elephant in the room is what is Mr. Wallace's cause of action? Is it a cause of action for being seized until he was arraigned? Or is it a cause of action for being seized for the eight and a half years that he was locked up until he was, the criminal case was resolved in his favor? My sister argues that it was just, the Federal remedy is only until you're being arraigned, and that the state remedy for malicious prosecution doesn't exist if the Seventh Circuit has construed Illinois law to say that there is no malicious prosecution when you win the Federal case, when you win the criminal case, because the evidence has been suppressed. The false imprisonment, state false imprisonment was dismissed by the district court, under his reading of Illinois law that the cause of action accrued at the time of the arrest. Not at the time he was released. And the Seventh Circuit when that issue was raised on appeal to them in a brief by both sides chose to reject it without discussion. What, the cause of action that respondent proposes is none, for the eight and a half year seizure. There is no state cause of action in Illinois. And there is no Federal cause of action. It is just tough. You are seized for eight and a half years, and you can't go to state court, you can't go to Federal court. You should have sued immediately after you were arrested to get a little bit of damages, but that's all you can get. And have a nice day; we're sorry. That, I don't think is consistent with Heck. I don't think it is consistent with this Court's jurisprudence about the meaning of Section 1983. I don't think it is consistent with the Fourth Amendment and it should not be the rule that the Court adopts. The statute of limitations problem isn't really a problem because all of the evidence that's material to the legality of the arrest, to the legality and the -- whether the confession was the proximate -- was proximately caused by the arrest or proximately caused by the incarceration, has been developed in the criminal case. When there's very strong interest in seeing that the facts are fully determined and fairly determined for both sides. It is not that the police officer who sued eight -- eight and a half years later is much less is much less prejudiced than Mr. Wallace is, who comes out of prison after eight and a half years with no remedy. The questions about the multiple causes of action that can arise: if you're beaten, you have to sue immediately after you're beaten; if you're beaten but a confession is extorted from you, your right to sue starts with the confession is used against you at trial -- and if there's some constitutional violation which necessarily impairs the conviction, then you can sue after you successfully defended a criminal case -- is really an administrative nightmare that really could be solved by a Federal tolling rule that all Section 1983 cases are tolled; the statute does not start to run until the criminal case has been resolved. In most cases, then, instead of being filed in district court --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That in effect is saying we can't have a statute of limitations rule; we're just going to laches, we're just going to an equitable rule.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
05-1240 +++$+++ 35715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We're just throwing up our hands and saying there is statute of limitations statute of limitations.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FLAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, there is a statute of limitations. It starts to run when the criminal case is over. That will weed out all of the really nonsensical cases that would otherwise be filed under respondent's rule, when you file the 1983 action the same day you file the motion to suppress and the district judge says well, this goes on my state calendar of 5,000 cases and the clerk's office is troubled with collecting the $350 filing fee in installments, and the jails are troubled by paying those installments every time there's $10 in the prisoner's account. It's -- it would -- there are more important things for the courts, the prisons to do. Thank you.
05-1240 +++$+++ 35717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35721 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument first this morning in Philip Morris v. Williams. Mr. Frey.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35723 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This case is here following this Court's remand to the Oregon courts to reconsider their decision in light of State Farm, a task at which we submit the Oregon courts completely failed. It presents two independent but thematically interrelated issues, both of which implicate what the Court said in State Farm, which is that, and I quote, "courts must ensure that the measure of punishment is both reasonable and proportionate to the amount of harm to the plaintiff and to the general damages recovered." Now significantly, Respondent defends neither -- oh, I should stop for a minute and describe the issues. So the first issue is whether the Oregon Supreme Court properly held that Philip Morris was correctly denied an instruction which would have told the jury that it was not to punish for harm to nonparties. The Oregon Supreme Court held that that Official instruction was legally incorrect, it was proper for the jury to punish for harm to nonparties, and therefore the instruction was correctly denied.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Frey, are you talking about what is numbered, is it number 34?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. The key paragraph from number 34 which is set forth at page 4 of our brief, as well as numerous other places in the materials. It says, the size of any punishment should bear reasonable relationship to the harm caused to Jesse Williams by the defendant's punishable misconduct. Although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what that reasonable relationship is, you're not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct of other persons who may bring lawsuits of their own, etc.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You don't think that would confuse the jury if they are first told that they may consider the extent of harm suffered by others, and then the next instruction seems to say they can't?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't. First of all, I don't think that's what it says, and I don't think it would confuse the jury, and I'm confident that with that Official instruction, counsel could explain it. But let me stop here, because I know this was something that Justice Scalia expressed some uncertainty about in the State Farm argument, and that the Oregon Supreme Court said they didn't clearly understand. To consider the conduct means to evaluate it in connection with assessing the blameworthiness of the conduct being punished.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35730 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't that the problem? If the instruction had said that, you would have a very different instruction, and I'm bothered by the instruction too for just that reason. It says you may consider, and if I were a juror parsing the instruction, I would say, "why? You've just told me I'm not supposed to punish them."
05-1256 +++$+++ 35731 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the second part of it is, what punishment means is what would be done in a class action, for instance, to impose punishment for all the harm suffered by Oregon smokers.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35732 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. This is an argument you're making to us, but I don't know how a juror is supposed to figure this out.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35733 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, let me say a couple of things about that. First of all, the Oregon Supreme Court did not rely on this aspect. It held that it was Official proper to punish for harm to nonparties. Now this, in our view, this instruction, and there's always a danger when you add words to an instruction that you will add something that a court will find was incorrect and therefore deny the instruction, even though the essence of it was correct.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where did the Oregon Supreme Court say it was proper to punish for harm to nonparties? Your brief quotes something to that effect, but -- the sentence on page 18(a) of the appendix to the petition. It says, what the Oregon court said is, Philip Morris asserts that Campbell prohibits the State acting through a civil jury from using punitive damages to punish a defendant for harm to nonparties. The Oregon Supreme Court on its own, I think, didn't put it in terms of harming particular nonparties, but to exposing Oregon residents to the risk of a deadly disease.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I would refer the Court to pages 20(a) to 21(a) of the appendix, where the court discusses, comes to its conclusion on this point. And it says, the instruction would have prohibited the jury from punishing the defendant for the impact of its alleged conduct on other persons even if those persons were Oregonians who were harmed. But on 28(a) it says, Official because the proposed jury did not accurately reflect the law, this is not a statement about Philip Morris's position, the trial court did not commit reversible error when it refused to give it. So I think the court was quite clear in saying -- let me complete my answer, because I think considering it moves the needle along the scale of allowable punishment for the harm to Jesse Williams, but it does not abandon the principle of proportionality to that harm, whereas punishing for it is what you would do in a class action. You would punish for all the harms to all the Oregonians. This is a one-way class action in which Philip Morris was exposed to global punishment by the jury without any of the protections of a class action. So --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me -- let me -- let me focus the problem that I have right now this way. If I look at the Oregon Supreme Court opinion, and particularly at the point that you mention in 20 and 21, I have to say I, I read the opinion the way you read the opinion. I read them the same, just what you claimed they were saying. The difficulty that I have is because I think the instruction that was proposed on behalf of your client was not a clear instruction, I have great difficulty in seeing how I could find that it was error to refuse to give the instruction. Official
05-1256 +++$+++ 35737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So my problem is, if I think they really did have the wrong view of the law but the issue was focused at the trial court by a request for an instruction which I think was properly denied, what do I do? Do I concentrate on what they said in the opinion or do I concentrate on what I think was the deficiency of the instruction?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think what you do is decide the Federal issue, which I think is whether they were correct in the legal proposition that they asserted.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But then they would respond, when they made that, when they gave that explanation in the Oregon Supreme Court, they were responding to a claim of error which was focused and raised at the trial level by the request for an instruction, which strikes me as probably an unsound instruction, an unsound request.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I guess we could leave it up to them whether they want to disallow the instruction for a different reason, but the fact is they disallowed it for the reason that you say.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And we can say that is Official error and remand it to them. That might not make you very happy, but it would be up to them whether or not --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In effect, it would give you another chance in Oregon.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35746 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I do want to question the premise. First of all, the instruction says basically what this Court said in BMW, which is where it drew precisely that distinction.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35747 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was a good thing we weren't instructing a jury.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35748 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't think there is -- the concept may be abstract, the difference between considering and punishing, but it's quite clear in this Court's jurisprudence and I think it can be made quite clear to the jury with the benefit of the proper instruction, and I don't -- I don't have any --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35749 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, I do too. I don't have any trouble with the distinction.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If we had this instruction, if we had this instruction which I believe is correct, there is nothing incorrect about this instruction. It is correct that the jury may consider. We are not challenging that the jury may consider the conduct and Official may determine that the conduct --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it doesn't answer the question, if the juror were to speak up. It doesn't answer the question. Consider for what? How? Why am I supposed to be considering it when you've just told me not to punish?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think the instruction said --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or not punish for other --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think the instruction says that you are to consider it in connection with determining the reprehensibility of the conduct.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35755 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. If it had said that, I would have no trouble with it. What it says is, you may consider it in determining what the reasonable relationship is between the harm caused to Jesse Williams and the amount of punitive damages assessed. I don't see how injury to others can have any bearing upon whether the punitive damages bear a reasonable relationship to Jesse Williams' harm. That's my problem with it.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35756 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they do, because conduct that is more blameworthy, in terms of determining, as this Court has said in all its cases, and I know you don't agree with the whole inquiry -- Official
05-1256 +++$+++ 35757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But as this Court has made quite clear, the reprehensibility of the conduct is an important factor in determining where along the scale of reasonable relationships in a particular case you might, the relationship might be reasonable. So, more conduct that is calculated to harm large numbers of people can be found more blameworthy as to warrant a higher proportion, a higher relationship between the punitive and compensatory damages.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And when you do that, counsel, aren't you punishing the defendant for the harm to others? You're going to award a higher multiple with respect to the damages --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- based on the conduct to others. Why wouldn't a normal juror think --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think you are --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Excuse me. Why wouldn't a normal jury view that as punishing the defendant for the harm to others?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think that the semantical quibbling is not something that the jury would have difficulty with, in my opinion. But let me try to explain the difference this way. If you're considering Official the conduct in relation in determining what is the proper punishment for the harm to Jesse Williams, you should come up with a number that can be properly replicated in case after case if other juries arrived at the same conclusion about the conduct. If you are punishing for the conduct, you should come up with a number that precludes further punishment for the same, punishing for the harm, further punishment for the same harm, for the same causes of action for punitive damages that various Oregonians had. So there's a fundamental difference in that respect between considering and punishing for it, and the Court has said repeatedly, and I don't think we can contest this, that the character of the conduct can be considered in determining the proper level or allowable level of punitive damages, that included the character of the conduct is the intended scope of the harm, if it's an isolated incident, if it's a consistent pattern of misconduct. So, I don't think we could properly have told the jury that they may not consider the conduct without getting ourselves in serious trouble. So -- and I don't, I don't think, and the difference is potentially enormous. If you think about a jury that was deciding a punitive damages class action and a jury that was told that they had to punish for the harm to the particular Official plaintiff in the, in the particular case, it's, it's obvious that the results would be vastly different in those cases. And the problem we were worried about was that the jury would think of itself as the punishment agency to impose statewide punishment for the harms to all Oregon smokers who were deceived by Philip Morris --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Mr. Frey, let me ask you a question. Suppose this was a criminal case and the defendant was being punished for crime A and the judge in working out the sentence realizes he also committed crimes B, C, D, and E. He could take those into account in determining the extent of the sentence given for crime A. Why isn't that similar?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is similar, but what he can't do is punish for crimes B, C, D, and E. Suppose we had a mail fraud prosecution --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And if there was a second -- the same defendant got convicted again for crime X. At that sentencing the judge could again take into account the harm to defendants B, C, and D.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true. That's certainly true. That's why our point is that it's one thing to produce a punishment that can properly be replicated in case after case without producing an excessive total punishment. It's another thing to punish in case after Official case for the same harms.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's not the same harm if it's a different defendant or a different plaintiff in the second case. You're punishing him for the harm to be this time, and you can -- just as in a criminal case, why can't you in both cases take into account that, the harm to the class, to the public at large?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If this was a mail fraud prosecution for defrauding Jesse Williams into buying cigarettes and the punishment was five years for that, the judge could consider in setting the punishment between zero and five the fact that this was part of a scheme that was intended to or may have deceived large numbers of other people in setting the punishment between zero and five. What the judge cannot do and what we were worried the jury would do here and what we think the size of its verdict may suggest it actually did here is to think that they could punish it that time not just 5 years, but 10 or 15 or 20 for all of the other punishments, for all the other wrongs that they find to have been done.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In that respect, how does the -- there may not be a definitive authority by this. Oregon says that if a corporation commits manslaughter it's required to pay up to twice the amount Official the corporation gained by committing the offense --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- is my understanding. Suppose a corporation in a hypothetical case commits five manslaughters. Would they be liable -- and gained for $1 million. Would they be liable for twice a million dollars in every manslaughter case?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. But I think the disgorgement argument that has been made by the other side suffers from exactly the same problem as the global punishment problem. That is, you can't -- if you disgorged in every case all the profits that were earned from selling cigarettes to Oregonians and to Oregonians became who sick --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Mr. Frey, we don't know what Oregon law is on that point. They do have a law that the Oregon court thought meant that they must adjust in the next case. And how would you deal -- would it be different if Oregon, as many States, said part of that punitive award goes not to the plaintiff, but to some State fund?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't, I don't think that -- our complaint is not that the plaintiff is getting the money. Our complaint is with how much we're being punished and what the procedural regime is that has led Official to punishing us.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if the law in Oregon were, plaintiff number two, you don't get punitive damages or you can get only the difference between what the jury awarded you and what Philip Morris has already paid out in punitive damages?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, first of all, that's not the law in Oregon.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't know what it is. We haven't had the second case.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we have no -- well, the Oregon Supreme Court did not rely on this, on this statute, for purposes of dealing with the harm to others, harm to nonparties problem. The statute does not require giving credit, only consideration. Even if it, even if it did, it operates as a one-way ratchet. That is, you keep making awards until you've reached the maximum that would be allowable for all the conduct even though juries, properly instructed, might have awarded substantially less and even though many juries might exonerate the defendant totally, as many juries have in tobacco cases. So the Oregon regime is, is a formula for having what amounts to excessive punishment or at least unfair punishment. And finally, the, the 30.925, which was Official referred to by the court of appeals, requires submitting this evidence to the jury and, as the trial court said in this case at page 195a of the joint appendix, there is no telling whether submitting the prior awards to the jury would produce higher or lower awards in this case. So I think it's an entirely illusory protection to rely on that.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can I ask you -- are you finished?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. I was going to say that because our concern is structural with the design of the Oregon system as it's been approved by the Oregon Supreme Court, I don't think this inadequate remedy can save that system.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35783 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I wanted to know what you think about a suggestion that I got from something that Justice Scalia said. I don't know whether he was making it or not, but I'll make the suggestion and see what you think. Suppose that this case -- suppose we were to say, there are many issues in this case, some of them very difficult, but one thing we're certain about: You cannot in a trial consistent with the due process clause in a trial of plaintiff versus defendant take money from the defendant and give it to the plaintiff for the purpose of punishing the Defendant for something he did Official to a different person who wasn't there. Now -- so he couldn't defend against him. That person didn't present a claim. So we are certain of that. Now, we're not certain whether that's what happened here. It may have done. There is certainly a lot of language to suggest it, and there is some language the other way. So we remand it to the court with that instruction that they cannot permit this to have happened if it happened. Whether it happened and what happened is a matter of Oregon law in large part and things about instructions, etc. Now, what's your view of that kind of disposition?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35784 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think the first part of your premise is clearly correct and totally consistent with the position we are taking. Whether it happened here or not is an interesting question. It is in the nature of a limiting instruction, which was basically what this was. You can use the evidence for one purpose, legitimate purpose, but don't use it for an illegitimate purpose. But we can't tell ordinarily, because jury deliberations are secret and we can't probe what they have decided, we can't probe whether they have imposed global punishment or not. But we anticipate the problem. We proposed an instruction which would as best we could at the time Official address the problem. Maybe it could be edited up to be a little sharper. But I think it contains the essential point that we're driving at here today.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Maybe, but it's possible the Oregon court would say: Well, no instructions are perfect, but -- and no set of jury instructions is perfect. But if we look at the jury instructions without the suggested one that was rejected and then we look at the suggested one, we find the suggested one had many things wrong with it, not just, you know, problems, confusion, et cetera. We find the instructions weren't perfect but, given Oregon evidentiary law, we think the trial judge made reasonable decisions, therefore okay.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're raising a question whether that would be an adequate --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know. That's what worrying me, what's worrying me about this is I see as we try to determine what this instruction said, whether it was good enough, whether the instructions without it are good enough, that we're going to be in a kind of bog of mixtures of constitutional law, unclear Oregon State law, not certain exactly what was meant by whom in the context of the trial, et cetera.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think this is a pretty fundamental principle. I believe the instruction fairly Official captured it. I don't think there would be an adequate and independent State ground for refusing the instruction. Keep in mind that in State Farm the Court said the defendant upon request would have been entitled to an instruction on the subject of extraterritorial punishment. Now, this is conceptually not really different from extraterritorial punishment. We wouldn't --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Frey, I suppose your theory here depends on the nature of the underlying tort, I suppose, in that there are, you argue, defenses that might be available with respect to other, other individuals who are harmed.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Certainly.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So this argument wouldn't apply in a case if the underlying tort weren't susceptible to those sorts of defenses.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would still apply because different factfinders, different juries, might reach different conclusions on the same evidence, assuming that a summary judgment for the plaintiff is not proper. What you're doing is preempting, you're allowing a potentially aberrational verdict, which there could be in many cases, to preempt the work of other juries. The whole essence of the idea that we were trying to convey Official here and the legal principle that we are arguing today is to confine the jury to its proper domain and its domain is the case before it.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The jury can't really find that other people were harmed. The jury doesn't have evidence before it except as to this person. The most the jury can find, it seems to me, is that the, the activity engaged in bore a very serious risk of harming other people. I think a jury could find that. And therefore, the activity is more heinous and should be punished more severely. But I -- you don't --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Accepting the premise, accepting the premise, we don't disagree with your conclusion. That is, if the jury could find that they could punish this more severely. What they cannot do is punish it globally.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but I don't think I'm quibbling, but you seem to be conceding that this jury can decide that other people have been harmed and take into account the harm that it found other people suffered in deciding the penalty. And I don't think this jury has any basis for finding that other people were harmed. It could say there was a serious risk of it.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It can certainly consider the Official scope of the intended scheme. The fact that it didn't have evidence didn't stop the Oregon Court of Appeals from finding and the Oregon Supreme Court from endorsing the finding that many Oregonians were deceived, even though --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35797 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't there a distinction between actual harm to others and the risk of harm? Supposing a defendant fired a machine gun into a crowd of people.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35798 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35799 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And he killed one, at least one. And that one sued and said: I want extra punitive damages because all these other people were subjected to the same risk. Wouldn't that be a proper consideration?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35800 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it is. I think in TXO the Court --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35801 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would it be a proper consideration even if a second person brought the same action?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35802 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if there were more, if there were other people who had causes of action, then I think there is a problem. In your hypothesis if only one person is injured --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35803 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you're not asking to Official recover for the actual harm to the others. You're saying there was a general risk of harm to many, many people, which is similar to what we have here. We don't know whether they're harmed or not, but that can be taken into account in fixing the ultimate verdict.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35804 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's what the Court said in BMW in effect, that the jury could consider even out of State conduct insofar as it revealed something about the blameworthiness of the defendant's conduct, the defendant's state of mind, the defendant's intentions. We're not saying that these things can't be considered for that purpose. What we are saying is that other people can bring their own lawsuits and punishment in those lawsuits -- If $79.5 million is right for Jesse Williams --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35805 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't the time to determine what to do with the second lawsuit is when the second lawsuit is brought?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35806 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, because the problem is a problem with the design. If you punish in the beginning -- if you have A, B, C, and D who are potentially injured and you punish in A's case for the harm to B, C, and D and then the defendant --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35807 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But can't I punish for the risk of harm to B, C, and D? Official
05-1256 +++$+++ 35808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if you're punishing for the risk of harm then the same punishment would be appropriate in B's case and C's case and D's case.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35809 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But part of this award, at least according to the trial -- there's a footnote referring to an Oregon statute that provides for the distribution of punitive damages between prevailing parties and the State of Oregon. Is -- was this award shared?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35810 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it hasn't been paid yet.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35811 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But would it be?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35812 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it would be subject to that statute. Now, there's a question whether under the master settlement agreement it would have to be paid back to the companies. But that's a separate question that's not before the Court. But our position --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35813 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if the State law provides that part of the recovery goes to the State, then at least as to the part that goes to the State you can say, well the State has recovered and you can't --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35814 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But we have no protection for that. We have no protection. First of all, this verdict --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But then you can object in the next case if you're subjected to -- Official
05-1256 +++$+++ 35816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And if we win the next case and we win the case after that and we win the case after that, when do we get credit?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I mean when you lose the case on the merits and there's a determination of damages, Oregon says, we adjust for having a prior award. We don't know what that adjustment will be.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, but the regime is flawed in its structure because it's a ratchet to get up to the highest possible level even though juries who understood the underlying constitutional principle might award less. So I'd like to save, if I may, the balance of my time for rebuttal.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Frey. Mr. Peck.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35821 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'll start with the proposed instruction because that is where Philip Morris began and the Oregon courts properly treated that as an enigma. It told the jury, it would have told the jury, both that they could consider the extent of harm and not Official consider the extent of harm with respect to a reasonable relationship. That's the disparity guide post. Clearly, that is not what this Court has said. And what, it's not what the Oregon Supreme Court did. It's also significant if you look at the actual proposed instruction, which is, starts on page 240, 279(a) of the joint appendix, the, the proposed instruction says you may consider whether the imposition of punitive damages is necessary to punish and deter similar misconduct by defendant and others in the future. Now, that's part of a calculation that considers harm to others in the future as a potential harm. So that is one of the things that the Oregon Supreme Court discussed when it said that this does not reflect our law. It's also significant that they said that you could consider financial condition and you cannot consider financial condition which is part of the Oregon statute. Now Philip Morris in their reply brief says that we have conflated an alternative instruction with one that they offered but if you look at page 280(a) --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're losing me, counsel. What, what specifically is wrong with the instruction proposed here?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This instruction --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As briefly as possible, Official one, two, three.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This instruction basically advises the jury to do precisely what Philip Morris argues before this Court it cannot do and that is to take into account the harm suffered by others in determining this disparity.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35826 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- you object to in this instruction. I mean, and I thought our cases clearly established that you can consider the harm to others in assessing the reprehensible nature of the conduct. You don't disagree with that?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We don't disagree with that and that's precisely what the Oregon Supreme Court did.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ On the other hand, you cannot -- on the other hand you cannot punish the defendant for those harms particularly in a case where the defendant might have defenses available with respect to those others. So I understood what the instruction sought to do is simply try to draw, it's a fine line but the reason it's a fine line is because of our prior cases, and it tried to draw that distinction between assessing reprehensibility and punishing for harm to others.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We submit that it was unsuccessful in conveying properly what this Court has Official held and that is sufficient grounds for the Oregon Supreme Court to uphold the trial court's decision.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would it have been a proper instruction if the second sentence had read, although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what the -- what that reasonable relationship is, although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining how heinous the crime, the action of the defendant was, and hence -- what, what that reasonable relationship is? If you had just added in that additional thought.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, if that --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems to me that's all that's left out of it. Now does leaving that out of it make it erroneous?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Leaving that out made it erroneous because it said, not with respect to reprehensibility analysis but with respect to reasonable relationship. That was erroneous.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes but reprehensibility analysis is part of the reasonable relationship. The more reprehensible it is the higher the ratio can be, according to our cases as I understand it.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me take a step back because I think there is a confusion here over also the word Official punishment. Punitive damages do not punish for harm, they punish misconduct. And this is an important distinction because harm is a compensatory concept. You compensate others for harm and of course you cannot compensate others for harm in the course of this case. But you can consider the potential risks, the potential harm and the future harm if this course of misconduct is not deterred.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're saying this instruction was too favorable to you --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I'm saying --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- because it allowed them to consider harm.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- this instruction -- --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you don't think they should have been allowed to consider harm, correct?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This instruction as the Oregon Supreme Court said, you know, doesn't provide the clarity that Philip Morris hoped to provide to the jury. And it says and they can't see how this summarizes Philip Morris' interpretation of Campbell. That's in footnote 3 of the court's opinion.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why, why -- why though? I'm having the same problem. As I read the sentence that we have just been quoted it seems to me Official at first blush that it's completely right. You may consider the harm, the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what the reasonable relationship is. Now you have to be sophisticated in this. Don't ask me how the jury is, but assuming that they are, that means that the more severely awful the conduct, the higher the ratio between the damage award and the injury suffered by this victim in court. And if it's really bad, you're going to maybe have a hundred times this compensation instead of only ten times or five times. So -- we take it into account, the extent of the harm that could be suffered, in deciding what that ratio should be. That means it goes to the evilness of the conduct. But you are not to punish the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons who aren't here in court. In other words, what you aren't to do is to look at good old Mrs. Smith who has really suffered terribly, she happens not to be in court, think about her suffering, which is real and serious, and then say I'm going to punish this defendant because of what he did to her. Which would be a natural human reaction, and perhaps admirable, but regardless, the law is that that's what you're not supposed to do. So reading it as I just read it naturally, it seems to describe what our cases have said is the Official law. Why isn't that right? I'm looking for a real answer to the question. I'm posing it in a hostile way and hope I'll get an answer. [Laughter.]
05-1256 +++$+++ 35843 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer, if the instruction had been given the way you have just stated it we would have --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35844 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35845 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- had no problems. But it's not how it reads.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35846 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35847 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it's not what it does. It starts out saying that reasonable relationship is about the harm to Jesse Williams and then it says you may consider the harm suffered by others in determining that reasonable relationship. Well, how does harm to others help you figure out what the relationship to Jesse Williams is? It doesn't compute.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35848 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, because the instructions indicate and juries often do this that punitive damages are certain multiple of the compensatory damages, and therefore that's what they are saying. In determining what that multiple should be you consider whether they have harmed others. And this instruction would make all the difference to the world Official in terms of what lawyers are going to be arguing about. If you're allowed to punish for harm to others, you say, well, there is however many, a thousand other people in the plaintiff's position, so a thousand times would be perfectly reasonable but you wouldn't say that the conduct is a thousand times more reprehensible. There is a more, there is a more natural limit on the multiple when you get this kind of instruction.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35849 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, but juries don't look at punitive damages in terms of a multiple. They are not asked to multiply anything and they shouldn't be. They are looking at the misconduct. They are looking at how you deter others from similar misconduct. They are looking at profitability here which is a statutory requirement to them.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35850 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Counsel, it seems to me the point you're making is not the basis on which the Supreme Court of Oregon said the instruction was properly disallowed. The Supreme Court of Oregon said it was properly disallowed because you can take into account directly the harm to other people, isn't that the case?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35851 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is not the case.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35852 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. Why not?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35853 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As Justice Ginsburg pointed out Official earlier, the citations that they have used in their brief are to the characterization of Philip Morris' argument. But if you look at 30(a) in the petition -- and that second paragraph there starts out with "using harm to others as part of the ratio may have been correct under the plurality opinion in TXO" -- and then you jump down to, "however, it no longer appears to be permissible if it ever was."
05-1256 +++$+++ 35854 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what about footnote 3, on page 18(a)? On the last sentence says, if the jury cannot punish for the conduct which is harming others, then it is difficult to see why it may consider it at all.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35855 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's because of the nature of this conduct. This is not conduct that was directed at Jesse Williams and he was the sole recipient of what Philip Morris did here. This was a massive market directed fraud driven by their rational and deliberate decisions at the highest levels of the company to deceive customers and knowingly endanger their health. They knew that this would have a special impact on those who are highly addicted, as Jesse Williams was. And so this is the misconduct that Oregon is seeking to deter. And how is a State, given the considerable flexibility that this Court has recognized, going to deter that kind of misconduct if instead society's interest has to be Official fractionalized on an individual case-by-case basis knowing that the majority of those cases will never take place and in fact in Oregon will not?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35856 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because you read it's about harm. You say look here is the person doing something absolutely awful, I mean really awful. And look at how awful it is. It's the kind of thing that would have hurt X number of people badly, maybe kill them.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35857 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35858 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now I think we all agree that that's an appropriate thing to say. And as long as you can say that why can't you create serious damages for that type of conduct?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35859 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that is precisely what we believe the Oregon Supreme Court did here. When it talked about how highly reprehensible this was, extraordinary by any measure, it said those concerns override ratio by which they meant single digit ratios.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35860 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What do you say, I mean Justice Alito asked you a question about the footnote. And I, in all candor I think you told us more about the, your case than about the footnote, but let me ask you basically the same question about what the Oregon Supreme Court meant in the passage that runs from the bottom of 20(a) up to 21. It says "Philip Morris's Official proposed jury instructions would have prohibited the jury from punishing the defendant for the impact of its alleged misconduct on other persons even if those other persons were Oregonians who were harmed by the same conduct that had harmed Williams, and in the same way. As we noted that is not correct as an independent matter of Oregon law," and so on. That is not a totally unambiguous statement. I will concede that, but isn't the most obvious reasoning, reading of that a reading that says you can punish for harm to others, so long as those others are Oregonians and not people in other States?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35861 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I believe, Justice Souter that what the court was doing there which is somewhat similar to the analysis below in the Oregon Court of Appeals, was to talk about the prospective future victims of this fraud, that if it were not deterred which is a consideration that the Oregon statute makes clear, if it was not deterred then this kind of consideration for the same acts having the same effect on others then doesn't allow you to make sure that on that scale that this is at the high end of what we are --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35862 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a, that's a, I will assume that's a legitimate reading in your favor. But the answer, I mean, I think the response has to be after Official listening to you, I don't know. I don't know whether that's what they really had in mind here. And if, if I really can't figure out what they had in mind, and if I go back to the footnote that Justice Alito mentioned before, isn't perhaps the better, the better course to send this back to them and say, "We don't know what you mean. Were you saying you can punish for these others as distinct from considering risk to others for, on reprehensibility?" And let them tell us clearly. Isn't that the better course?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35863 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you know, perhaps that's one way to determine what the court meant. But I would suggest --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35864 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ One way to look at what it meant is what you argued below, I'm looking at the joint appendix page 199(a), the plaintiff's counsel in Oregon to the jury: "How many people do you see outside driving home smoking cigarettes?" Now, that type of argument is perfectly appropriate to assess reprehensibility. On the other hand, with the instruction that was offered the defense counsel could have warned the jury keep in mind you can't punish for those other people. We only have one plaintiff before us and we are assessing the reprehensibility with respect to that plaintiff. But without the instruction Official you're allowed to argue how many people do you see in Oregon smoking cigarettes?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35865 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me suggest that both the Oregon Supreme Court and the instructions that were actually given to the jury helped answer this by looking at the statutory criteria. Oregon has taken extraordinary steps since this Court's decision in Oberg to enact a statute that guides the courts on the, guides the juries and the courts in the assessment of punitive damages. You know, first there is a threshold. Before you can even plead punitive damages you must meet that threshold and you must demonstrate to the court by admissible evidence that there was a reckless and outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of harm, that they've acted with a conscious indifference to the health and safety and welfare of others. Now, this is part of what infuses it with public purpose. Then --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35866 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I just ask you what is the division? How much of this --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35867 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ 60 percent of an award by statute goes to a crime victims fund of the State of Oregon and as soon as the judgment is rendered then the State becomes a judgment creditor. Official
05-1256 +++$+++ 35868 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That has no relevance to the question of the extent to which the defendant is being punished, does it?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35869 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but the statutory criteria which requires that the jury find by clear and convincing evidence the following factors, which was given to this jury in the fashion that I'm about to tell you, constrains this award and I think properly makes it reasonable. First, you have to consider whether there is a likelihood that serious harm would arise from the defendant's misconduct. Second, the degree of the defendant's awareness of that likelihood. Three, profitability in the State of Oregon. Four, duration of the misconduct and concealment of it. Five, the attitude and the conduct of the defendant upon discovery of the misconduct. And then finally, financial condition of the defendant, which cuts both ways. It protects a defendant from being bankrupted by punitive damages while at the same time assures that punitive damages are enough to have that deterrent effect. Now even after that, the defendant could opt to have the jury address whether they had been previously punished for this misconduct or choose not to, which you would expect most defendants to choose, Official and instead post verdict, present that to the trial judge.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35870 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The trouble with the more basic question, I don't know if you can answer it, but it is a problem, that when I -- most States have factors like that, or many do. Alabama did. You know, not quite as good as that, and we saw the patent fraud, you know. And there are other cases that would bring up products liability. And it's pretty hard to think of a products liability case where the jury found negligence, where they might not also find these factors. Because in a typical case, you'll get competing memos within the company. Somebody will have been hurt and likely seriously, and when you start thinking about the victim in front of you, it all looks pretty bad, and it often is, at least in this instance. And now you read these five factors, and the difficulty for me has always been, well, you read the jury factors like that and they can do almost anything. And it's that, it's that fact that anything goes that I found disturbing.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35871 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But this last factor that I was about to get to, which I think provides a constraint that's unlike the ones that you've seen in other cases, and that is the total deterrent effect of other punishment imposed in any remedial measures the Official defendant has taken. Now this can be presented first to the trial judge, saying okay, we have this huge award, but, you know, we have been fined by the government, we have had punitive damages assessed against us in other cases, and as a result we have taken the following measures which assure that we will not engage in this kind of misconduct again, and as a result also, this award should be cut.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35872 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you say this after the fact? The jury doesn't hear this?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35873 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The jury does not. You have the option of presenting it to the jury but you do not have to present it to the jury. You can present it first to the trial judge and you can also present it at the appellate level.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35874 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems very odd that a major argument for constraint is something that the jury can't hear. It just goes to show, really, the irrational nature of the exercise.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35875 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would suggest it's not irrational because what you do is, you've given the defendant the option as a strategic matter either to present it to the jury or if they think that will guarantee an award of punitive damages against them, they can withhold it and present it only to the trial Official judge. This is a protection to the defendant rather than, you know, an oddity, I think.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35876 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask this question? Assuming there's a distinction, and the instruction does, between taking into account the extent of harm to others on the one hand and punishing for the extent of harm on the other. As I understand what you recited about the five parts of the instructions, none of them really authorized punishment for harm to others.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35877 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is correct, and --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35878 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And is it also true that the part the Chief Justice quoted from 199(a), it seems to me that could be an argument that you should take into account the extent of harm to others, but it does not seem to me to be an argument that you can punish on. And the question I want to ask, are there other parts of the closing argument in which plaintiff's counsel argued that you should take into account, that you should punish for harm to others?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35879 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is not. The only argument that was made in closing was that you can think about the others, which was clearly intended to go towards that reprehensibility analysis. You know, certainly in the criminal law context, an attempted crime is punished as badly as an actual crime when all the elements that Official are required to, to accomplish that crime have occurred. And in the context of this very unusual long in duration misconduct, what you had to do was you had to look at that broad attempt to effect Oregon --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35880 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you think juries can, Oregon juries or juries anywhere can understand what they are told if they are told, you can take into account conduct directed at other people for the purpose of assessing how reprehensible the conduct is, but you can't punish for the harm that is caused other people?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35881 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I believe they can. This -- this jury did a very good job. First of all, if they --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35882 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They can understand that distinction and --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35883 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I believe they can.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35884 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you would have them apply that principle in this case?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35885 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They understood contributory or comparative negligence, and gave no award on the basis of negligence. They made a distinction in, in the fraud claim by only awarding a little bit more than $21,000, even though the request was much higher.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35886 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if they can understand that distinction, why wasn't the defense counsel entitled to argue to the jury just as you Official argued, you can consider the harm to others in assessing reprehensibility, why couldn't the defense counsel say, but, you can't punish for the harm to others, if as you answered to Justice Alito, a jury can understand that distinction?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35887 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I believe the defense counsel would have been entitled to make such an argument. I don't think there would have been any need for corrective instruction. But what they proposed, which was conflicting in two different respects, just did not meet the muster.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35888 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you think it would have been, putting aside what they proposed, if they had proposed an instruction that said, you may consider the harm to others in assessing how reprehensible the conduct is but you may not punish Philip Morris for the harm to others, you would have had no objection to that instruction?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35889 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would have had no objection.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35890 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So your only objection is that they left out the reason why it is relevant to determining what the ratio should be? They just didn't say you can consider it in connection with reprehensibility. Why is that crucial?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35891 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it was critical and of Official course, you know, Oregon is entitled to run its court system as it has for more than 30 years.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35892 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But why was it critical?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35893 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why was it critical?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35894 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why was it corrected?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35895 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah. Justice Scalia said, you know, they left out this one little bit. Why was that critical? What's the answer.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35896 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the answer is because, again, it was not directed for the specific purpose for which harm to others may be considered, and that's in the reprehensibility analysis. There is no disagreement between the parties on that.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35897 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're saying, I think you're saying the jury couldn't have figured that out without somebody telling them?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35898 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what this instruction told him --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35899 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't that what you're saying?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35900 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I'm not saying that. What the instruction told them is to consider it with respect to the reasonable relationship. That means the ratio. That means proportionality. And that would suggest, as Justice Stevens suggested, that they might multiply it Official by how many people are out there, because I think this instruction was an enigma and was confusing.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35901 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Too favorable to you. Too favorable to you again, right? (Laughter.)
05-1256 +++$+++ 35902 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You know, perhaps so. But you know, the fact of the matter is that, you know, we did not advocate that the jury punish for harm to others. We do not believe the Oregon court upheld this judgment for that reason. If I can go on to the, some of the other points that are made by Philip Morris. They talk about this Court's decision in State Farm as if it were nothing more than a ratio, so they reduce the decision to ratio. They transform the most important indicium, reprehensibility, into a subsidiary role in the ratio analysis.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35903 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I make, just to get the ground rules here, you're not asking us to reconsider either State Farm, BMW, any of our punitive damages precedents?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35904 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, we are not asking you to do that. We think that this, this judgment is valid under those precedents. They denigrate the State's interest which this Court has said is the first consideration, Official the State's interest in deterrence to this fractionalized sort of passenger on each individual lawsuit, even though the State's interest here when we get to the punitive damages phase, it's infused with public purpose, that State interest is in deterring misconduct, not in figuring out how many dollars might be additionally awarded to the plaintiff or even into its crime victims fund. It removes the State's flexibility and ability to experiment with different ways to address the concerns that this Court has stated with respect to punitive damages.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35905 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It depends when you say something about duplicative recoveries, because that seems to be a major concern.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35906 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This total deterrent effect requirement is the key here, that this is a part of a State statute that says that to the extent that there had been prior punitive damage awards that have operated to affect that deterrence that the State is interested in, to the effect that there have been other punishments, to the effect that there had been remedial measures taken to prevent such misconduct again in the future, then the judge is to reduce this award. The Oregon Supreme Court has said that this fully addresses the concern with multiple awards, duplicative awards, Official and that authoritative construction by that court should, should weigh heavily with this Court. But at the same time, the fact of the matter is --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35907 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what if -- your friend says, what if we never get assessed for any other case? Where do we make up this money?
05-1256 +++$+++ 35908 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you know --
05-1256 +++$+++ 35909 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose they win every other case in Oregon.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35910 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, as a practical matter, they have been, they have lost both, the only two cases that have gone to a trial in Oregon. And as a practical matter, the statute of ultimate repose practically prevents any future Oregon plaintiff from bringing such a lawsuit. They would have to show that they contracted cancer or a disease from smoking within the repose period, which is eight years, if one were filed tomorrow, eight years ago, and that indeed that the fraud was a substantial factor in contracting that disease. That is what we were put to prove in this case, the relevant date being 1988. Now imagine, that window is rapidly closing on eight years, because it was after this case that Philip Morris decided that they were no longer going to deny that smoking causes cancer and they were no longer Official going to deny that nicotine was addictive. So that window is rapidly closing, and it's highly unlikely that a smoker can point to eight years ago as the point at which their cancer basically became active. So as a practical matter, there is going to be no awards, future awards in Oregon. And as a legal matter, doctrinal matter, I believe that Oregon has taken the step necessary to prevent multiple awards. You know, six States do not permit punitive damages in most instances. Another 20 or so cap punitive damages. And then 12, of which Oregon is one, has chosen a method like this to address that duplicative award approach. I think that kind of experimentation which is done in good faith, which has been authoritatively construed by the courts to address this question, is sufficient to address any concerns with due process. But let's, let's remember also, that while the Constitution contains many places where numbers are important, the President must be 35 years of age, it has implied in other places numbers, like in one person, one vote. But the due process clause in its spaciousness and majesty doesn't talk about numbers, and that is where the concern is only about reasonableness. It's about fairness. And here the Oregon legislature, Official supplemented by the Oregon courts, have taken those steps to properly constrain awards. Since the decision in Oberg, there have been only 14 punitive damage decisions in Oregon. Four of them have been overturned entirely by the Oregon Supreme Court, so no punitive damages awarded. There are only two out of all those awards that exceed single digits, and this is one of them. So I think that the courts have done a good job there of trying to address these concerns. And one of the areas of agreement between our opponents and us is that the statement in their brief that, reprehensibility ensures that the greater wrong receives the greater punishment. But the regime that they are suggesting, one that has a categorical ratio limit and atomizes this kind of consideration so you don't look at the broader societal and public purpose, that one guarantees a regime of underdeterrence. And Oregon has, as it is their right, opted for optimal deterrent effect. Thank you.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35911 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Peck. Mr. Frey, you have four minutes remaining.
05-1256 +++$+++ 35913 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. FREY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Official Let me, let me start with, let me start with the observation that Mr. Peck has argued as though this was a class action, as though total deterrence, disgorgement, and all these things were all to be achieved in this case, which is the heart of our problem here with the denial of the instruction. He referred to this other case in Oregon, which is the Schwarz case, as finding liability also, but what he didn't mention was that on the issue of the fraud relating, involving the relationship between cancer, between smoking and health, the jury found for the defendant. They found liability on a different issue, but not on this issue. So it hardly proves that we would lose all cases. It's also true that in that case, where the jury did not receive -- we asked for but we didn't get an instruction like this -- the jury actually came back and said: Does our award have to be reasonably related to the injury to Mrs. Schwarz? And the judge refused to tell them the answer to that. So juries do understand this problem and they do think about this problem. The suggestion was made that you can present prior awards to the trial judge. Now, I, I hope during my opening argument I covered the reasons why there's a structural deficiency in the system if the system even called for getting credit, which the Official statutes don't require. But you should know that the Oregon plaintiffs' lawyers have argued that under the Oregon Constitution it must be presented to the jury or is it may not be considered by the court. So while here he wants to assure you that it can be presented to the court, that's not the position they are taking below. On the question by Justice Souter about whether you should send it back and what the Oregon Supreme Court meant by its discussion, if it didn't mean what we say it meant they should have reversed and said were entitled to the instruction or identified some other reason why we're not entitled to the instruction. Now, there may be some independent State ground that you're not aware of, but you ought to say at a minimum that they were wrong and that a defendant in a punitive damages case is entitled to an instruction of this general nature, and then we can let the Oregon courts on remand address whether there is some other problem which we frankly don't see, but that would be for them. Now, if Mr. Peck is right about the nature of the conduct, there should be plenty of lawsuits and plenty of liability. If there isn't, the Court can't speculate that we ought to punish Philip Morris more in this case because other people are not Official sufficiently aggrieved to sue. That seems to me totally impermissible speculation. On the question of harm versus conduct, the unit of prosecution is the cause of action, so that it's not, it's not, you can repeatedly -- in our, in our submission you can repeatedly punish a defendant for the same conduct, for the impact of the same conduct causing injury to different people. What we are basically saying is that there are, there are potentially many causes of action out there for this conduct and the punishment in this case should be limited to the cause of action that is being tried before the jury in this case. Let's see if I -- if I have anything else. Justice Stevens talked about the ambiguity of the closing argument and I agree it's not clear what plaintiff's counsel was exactly saying. It could be interpreted in different ways. But that is a reason to have a cautionary instruction, not a reason to forgo one, to make sure the jury understands the applicable principles. Thank you.

05-1272 +++$+++ 35918 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We will hear argument next in 05-1272, Rockwell International Corporation versus United States. Ms. Mahoney.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35920 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Tenth Circuit in this case correctly held that Stone could not share in the award given by the jury unless he was an original source of pondcrete allegations. But it then went on to find that he was an original source based upon a misinterpretation of the core requirements of the statutory definition.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35921 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Ms. Mahoney, let me ask you a question. Am I wrong about this? It seems to me that if he was not an original source, not only shouldn't he get any money, but neither should the government. Isn't that the way the statute reads?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35922 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, that is one possible interpretation of the statute.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35923 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How is there any other possible one? It says there's no jurisdiction in this situation.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35924 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think the way that the courts have handled it below is that it says that there's no jurisdiction unless it is a claim brought by a relator who is an original source or if it's brought by the United States. And if the relator drops out, I think courts deem it to at that point be viewed as a claim brought by the United States. It's sort of a retroactive amendment of the pleadings.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35925 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's not brought by the United States as long as he's still there.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35926 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35927 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's your argument.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35928 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it can't be, Your Honor, because under the statutory terms, under section 3720(a) the Attorney General has the authority to bring a claim on behalf of the United States. There is no authority for the United States to bring a claim on behalf of the relator. Instead there is a second type of claim under section 3730, and that's a section (b), which authorizes a relator to bring a claim on behalf of himself and the United States. Similarly, Your Honor, if you look at the provisions in section (d), which authorize an award to a relator, it requires that the action be one brought under section (b), that is in other words it be an action brought by the relator which the United States then proceeds on for (d)(1).
05-1272 +++$+++ 35929 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I guess it really depends on whether you think the language "if the Government proceeds with an action" is equivalent to the Government's bringing the action.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35930 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't think it can be, Your Honor, because if you look at the language throughout these sections, it differentiates between two kinds of actions, actions brought by the United States or the Attorney General and actions brought by the relator. And it is only an action brought by the relator under section (b) that authorizes an award under section (d). And it consistently talks about that. What they're really arguing, Your Honor, is that --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35931 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, wait. It says under 3, what is it, (c)(3) I guess, if the elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action. Now, that suggests that if the Government intervenes the Government is proceeding with the action, right?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35932 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35933 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you say that's different from the Government bringing the action.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35934 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely. If you look at, if you look at the language in section (d), for instance, it says if the government proceeds with an action brought by a person under section, subsection (b). In other words, it has to be an action under subsection (b) in order to authorize an award at all. The Government has -- has authority under subsection (a) to bring an action, but it has no authority to bring it on behalf of the relator. The statute consistently uses these same terms, and this Court in Graham County, which was a decision dealing with the statute of limitations, actually described this section in the same way, saying that there are two kinds of actions, those that are brought by the Attorney General under subsection (a) and those that are brought by a relator under subsection (b), which the United States can then proceed with. What the relator is really arguing here is that if you look at the -- at subsection (e)(4), they're adding a phrase that's not there. They're saying that there's no jurisdiction over an action under this section if it is brought by the Attorney General or brought by a relator who is an original source or the United States intervenes and proceeds with the action. And that's not in here.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35935 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're being very picky-picky with this text, considering that you're willing to swallow whole the notion that so long as the -- so long as the original party, so long as the non-government plaintiff drops out, all of a sudden it become as action brought by the United States. That's a very, very expansive notion of what "brought by the United States" means. What I'm saying is or, to put it another way, if you take your picky-picky notion of being brought by the United States, to be logical about it you must reach the conclusion that if you defeat the private plaintiff under -- under he's not original source, the whole thing is thrown out, not just his recovery but the Government's recovery.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35936 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, of course that would be great for Rockwell, and so --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35937 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I know, but it would be so extreme that we're not likely to buy it.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35938 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we don't argue for that because I think that the Court has said that the Government's intervention does not cure defects with respect to the relator, and therefore, if the relator didn't have -- that -- doesn't have standing -- you know, part of this goes to the issue of the Stevens assignment. If they don't have an assignment, then they don't even have standing to be in the action, they have no right to recover. And so if you're correct that it can't be cured, in effect, through a procedure like, say, 28 U.S.C. section 1553, which allows amendments to defective jurisdictional allegations where I think that, while the courts don't technically require it, they could say that really this, while it was pled as a section (b) action, when the relator drops out we could treat it as a section (a) action, because --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35939 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Otherwise, the Attorney General could just bring it all over again, a fresh complaint, and that would be wasted motion?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35940 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor. I think it is a pragmatic rule. But again, if the rule is that they lose as well, then so be it. The fact is this statute uses the term that is used in section (a), which is "brought by the United States." And it makes perfect sense because otherwise think of what the consequences are if the relator can simply copy an indictment, file a complaint, and say -- and the Government intervenes because it's a major action, and then they say, aha, you're stuck with me because you've intervened and now there's jurisdiction and there's no problem, I don't have to be an original source.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35941 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They don't have to give them any money, though. The court doesn't have to.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35942 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I think that you could say that they don't have to give them money.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35943 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you'd then have to pay his attorneys' fees. That's what really this is about, isn't it?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35944 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it is about that, but we don't have to pay his attorneys' fees, Your Honor, if he doesn't get a share, because the way that section (d) is written is it says that a relator who is paid a share of the proceeds shall also be entitled to attorneys' fees. So this is not just an issue between the United States and Stone. The statute controls the award of fees based upon whether he's entitled to a share. So even if this weren't an issue of jurisdiction, if he's not entitled to a share under a section (d)(1), then he's also not entitled to attorneys' fees. And therefore, we would win. He would still need to -- whether it's a jurisdictional rule or a substantive rule, if he's not an original source he's out. But the share is not the only issue that makes the Government's -- or that makes Stone's argument implausible here. That is that once the relator is in the action, the United States can't get them out of the action. Even if they don't have to pay them money, under subsection (c) they have a whole range of rights to participate in the action. They can't dismiss the relator. So it makes no sense to read this statute to say that someone who copies an indictment, files a complaint, the Government intervenes, they're in there forever. It instead makes much more sense to read the terms the way they're used elsewhere in the statute, to mean that there is only jurisdiction if it is a section (a) claim brought by the United States on behalf of itself or if it is a section b) claim by a relator that is an original source. That's what makes sense of the statute as a whole. If I could turn to the issue of whether or not the Tenth Circuit correctly held that Stone had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which his allegations were based. It bears emphasis that every act that he had to prove in order to recover on the pondcrete allegations -- whether they're measured at the beginning of the case or the end of the case doesn't matter -- every single act occurred after he left the plaintiff, after he had left his job. And we can see that from the outset of the case. If you look at his Responses to Interrogatories at JA-189 to 190, he identifies the factual basis for the pondcrete allegations that he is asserting. And that factual basis is described he is asserting and that factual basis is described as Rockwell's knowing storage of pondcrete on outdoor pads at the plant in violation of RCRA with false certification from 1987 to 1989. Now, he left his job in March of 1986. How could he possibly have direct and independent knowledge of those predicate acts?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35945 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, suppose a company has a plan to defraud the Government and it use a certain chemical mix to save money and that's what the real fraud is. And it puts it in place and it puts it in place in 1988. And the -- and it has just two containers full of this. And the relator knows about it. The relator then quits. Then for 10 years the company does the same thing, following the same patterns, same method, same improper formula. And he then rings -- he then brings this to the attention of the Government in the proper way and files a suit. He cannot recover for the later action which was the same pattern, practice?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35946 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Perhaps, Your Honor, in certain circumstances. I think the key question is what's the standard, and he has to have substantial knowledge about core fraudulent acts. And it may be reasonable in your hypothetical or some others to infer that he knew plenty about this fraudulent conduct and had plenty of reason to conclude that it was continuing on. But here, Your Honor, nothing of the kind happened. He didn't know about any fraudulent conduct pertaining to pondcrete before he left. And In fact, his allegations start in 1987. He does not say that there were pondcrete violations before then and indeed there were not. The reason there weren't is because when he was at the plant Rockwell was producing hard pondcrete, hard pondcrete, and it wasn't storing it on site, it was shipping it to Nevada. So he couldn't -- and it wasn't even clear that it was subject to RCRA because DOE didn't enter into a RCRA compliance agreement until after he left. He also concedes in his deposition that he was not, except with one exception -- he was not aware of any time when Rockwell affirmatively represented that it was in compliance with environmental safety and health provisions when it was not. That's JA-106. So he didn't -- unlike your hypothetical, he didn't know anything about there being a pondcrete fraud prior to the time of his departure and doesn't even allege one. Instead, what the Tenth Circuit rested upon was the fact that he had reviewed a design for making pondcrete 5 years -- in fact, not for making pondcrete; it was actually a design for removing sludge from the ponds -- 5 years before any of the events at issue here, and he said he predicted there would be a design problem.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35947 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It wouldn't have to have anything to do with pondcrete at all. The statute just says the information on which his allegations are based. They don't say the allegations that eventually give rise to a recovery.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35948 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, every court that has considered that question has said that it has to be analyzed on what they call a claim by claim basis. Let me explain the reason. First of all, let me explain what they mean by claim by claim. They really mean a factual theory of falsity, and that it has to be done on a claim by claim basis, and here's why --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35949 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Factual theory of falsity, that doesn't mean anything to me.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35950 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A theory of falsity. In other words, a claim, what is called a claim in these cases in the claim by claim analysis is a theory of falsity. In other words, it's why were -- why was the fraudulent claim false? Because there may be a certification, for instance, of compliance with let's say all laws and there could be five different, completely different fact patterns as to why that was false, and the damages might be completely differ as well. So all of the courts have said that's really the way that FCA cases are litigated, that's really what we call a claim. And then, moving back, if you didn't do it on a claim by claim basis, you would allow a relator to copy an indictment that he knows nothing about, come to court, file it, add one theory that he does know about, an overcharge for five dollars on a hammer, say that, I'm now entitled to proceed on the whole thing and if the Government doesn't intervene I get a minimum of 25 percent of the --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35951 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's one way to look at it. Another way would be you would allow a relator in a situation who alleges a particular fraud that causes the government to examine the books and uncovers a different fraud to recover on that basis. It's an unusual situation to have a jurisdictional prerequisite determined only after the case is over.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35952 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Your Honor, it doesn't have to be determined after the case is over. These inquiries should -- it should have been determined here as well at the very outset of the case. And it was. It was just determined wrong. We do not have to show that it was wrong at the end of the trial in order to prevail in this case. It was wrong at the beginning. The interrogatories --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35953 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you only show that it's wrong at the end, you still say that they should be thrown out.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35954 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, we do, Your Honor but it is not by any means necessary to the outcome in this case. And the reason why I think that you do have to at least allow for the possibility of looking at the end of the case, whether there is jurisdiction or not, is because of the nature of this particular jurisdictional bar. This is a jurisdictional bar that turns on the nature of the allegations at issue in the case. Much like -- I think the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is a perfect example because it too talks about jurisdiction being predicated on, for instance, commercial -- claims that are based upon commercial activity. Suppose that the plaintiff at the outset of the case when the 12(b)(1) motion is filed posits one theory of the case that involves a predicate commercial act. But when it gets to trial he's abandoned that theory and now he doesn't have any commercial act. Surely the Court would say you have to satisfy jurisdiction over the theory that has actually gone to trial. This statute is very much the same. And it should not be read in a way that allows relators to simply disguise the true basis of their claims, hide the relevance of the public information, and then just shift gears when you get to trial. But here again, if we just look at the very beginning of the case, he does identify in those interrogatory responses, for instance, what the factual basis for the pondcrete allegations are. All that factual basis is all identified as -- as core acts that occurred after he left the plant. So we can look back in this case and say that the trial court erred at the outset by not dismissing this portion of his claim as well as, in fact, should have dismissed the whole thing, Your Honor.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35955 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, his allegation was that this, the design is not going to work.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35956 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Your Honor --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35957 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's not an allegation that's -- I mean, it is either true or it's not true. The fact that you find out after he's left, after he's been terminated, that it doesn't work, I don't see how that should affect the validity of his allegations.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35958 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because, Your Honor, this, this is a statute about fraud. It's not a statute that's violated because Rockwell may have had a suboptimal pipe. That's not, that's not even the RCRA violation. That's not -- and it is certainly not a False Claims Act violation. They weren't selling pondcrete to the United States. He didn't know about a plan to defraud the United States.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35959 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They were certifying their compliance with the applicable laws --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35960 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At that, at the time --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35961 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- based upon their pondcrete design.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35962 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At the time that he was there that was not actually -- he didn't even allege that he knew they were doing that with respect to pondcrete. He didn't allege that there were any problems with respect to the pondcrete production or, or certifications during his tenure. From -- they began producing pondcrete in 1985, Your Honor. And there were no problems that were alleged with respect to that pondcrete. His claim by his own admission starts in 1987, after he was gone. And again, the mere fact that there may have been a defective pipe wouldn't establish the RCRA violation, because what they had to show by their owning pleading here was that they were storing it on site, that it was actually leaking, and, of course, the mere fact there may have been a problem with the pipe doesn't mean it is actually going to leak, because they can fix it in a variety of ways. They can add more cement, they can put it in metal containers, they can do a myriad of things. He didn't even say he knew know that there was a plan to not remedy and problems in the design that he had identified if and when there became a problem with it.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35963 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Am, am I correct that they were, in fact, using that same pipe or that same pipe system during a period when perfectly fine cement blocks were being produced?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35964 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We think that's correct, Your Honor.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35965 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that true, is that conceded?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35966 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think that it's conceded that -- well, their own counsels told the jury that they were making it wrong, they weren't adding enough cement, that that was the reason that it was failing; and the Government told the jury that they were making it fine until they reduced the ratio of cement. So yes, I think it is correct that it has been conceded at trial that the system was working fine as long as they were adding enough cement. But instead what happens after he left --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35967 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The whole purpose, the whole purpose of this legislation is to ferret out fraud on the Government. I mean, if he makes an allegation that this design is not going to work, the pondcrete is not going to work, and the Government, prompted by his lawsuit, investigates it and finds out that because of human error they're not making it the right way, even if the design does work, he get no credit for that?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35968 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, the statute isn't written in that way. But let me also call your attention to some facts. And that is that a year before he brought this claim --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35969 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what about the hypothetical? Are you suggesting that in a situation like that -- -we'll talk about whether the facts comport with it later -- but in a situation like that, he's not entitled to share in the recovery that the Government eventually receives?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35970 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If -- the mere fact that he is a trigger for the Government discovery of a different problem, no, that is not a basis for recovery. The statute says that if there has been a public disclosure, if -- let's assume there was a public disclosure. If there's no public disclosure it is no problem. He can bring whatever claim he wants. He doesn't have to have direct knowledge of it. Bit if there has been a public disclosures at that point he has to have direct knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based. And that has to be a substantial standard. Direct knowledge is one of the key things that the Tenth Circuit just did not --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35971 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You would, you would change that to say direct knowledge of the information not on which the allegations are based, but on which recovery is eventually -- eventually ordered?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35972 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ On which the allegations of the claim is based. In other words, it, it's not -- it has to be -- and the Government says this as well -- they say under that Section D(1), the relator isn't entitled to share in the proceeds of anything that the jury gives. The relator is only entitled to share in the proceeds of a claim for which they were an original source or for which they brought the -- brought the action under, under Section B. Sometimes the Government intervenes and adds its own claims not on behalf of the relator, because it doesn't have authority on behalf of the relator, and it takes the position, I think correctly, that the relator isn't entitled to a share in those circumstances. And Your Honor, this -- the courts have identified all the ways in which this statute doesn't make any sense if it is looked at on --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35973 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Identified them all?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35974 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- on a global basis. Excuse me?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35975 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They've identified them all already? (Laughter.)
05-1272 +++$+++ 35976 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I don't think they have identified them all. But I --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35977 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You may find another one.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35978 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I, I would also -- again, it would allow the relator to get, you know, a share of, when the Government doesn't intervene, a minimum of 25 percent of a billion dollar recovery after a public disclosure that he knew nothing about, if he just knew one little piece after separate theory of fraud.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35979 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the theory is not necessarily bad. The, the relator has to cooperate with the Government, ideally he should. And if the Government said we prefer a variance of your theory, and the relator said fine, "I don't want to put competing theories before the jury, so I'll surrender my first theory and go with the Government's," why should the relator be penalized for that good litigation practice? It doesn't necessarily mean that the original complaint is no good or even that it might not have been proved, if the Government had preferred another route.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35980 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well it there, if there's a minor variation, you know, something like that, I certainly don't think that disqualifies the relator from, from being an original source. And again, here he wasn't an original source even under his own theory at the outset of the case. What happened at trial is the one little thing that he knew or claimed to know, his prediction that a pipe would have a problem five years before, was dropped completely from the case. So he went from being a relator who knew something very small about the case or about the theories to nothing at all. It was never good enough, but certainly once, once that theory was -- once that piece of information dropped out, it just demonstrated, it just highlights that he's not an original source. And Your Honor, here it wasn't just that they didn't want to use that bit of evidence. It was actually inconsistent with the theory that they, that they pressed with the jury. They said the equipment was fine. Rockwell was making pondcrete just fine from 1985 forward until it stopped adding the cement. And that's what they -- that's the theory they went with. But again, measure it at the outset of the case, and he still wasn't an original source. If I could save the remainder of my time?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35981 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask just one quick question?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35982 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35983 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What was the public disclosure of the claim that ultimately prevailed?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35984 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The public -- there -- the public disclosure was in 19 -- it can be from several pieces. But in 1988, there were widely covered stories of the fact that pondcrete was being stored at Rocky Flats on outdoor pads, that it was leaking and that the reason it was occurring was because the employees had reduced the ratio of cement. And then you couple that with the disclosure --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35985 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the public disclosure was made in the newspapers rather than in an official Government proceeding?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35986 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct. It was in the newspapers. But it was definitely covered, Your Honor. And that was more than a year before he brought his action. And then in addition, there were disclosures of allegations of performance bonuses being paid based upon falsified evaluations. That's JA 143. Thank you.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35987 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Ms. Mahoney. Ms. Vullo.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35989 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. The Court should affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals because as the Government recognizes, Mr. Stone is an original source. And it is important to the look at the statute and its purpose. The original source provision is intended to determine who may bring a claim on behalf of the United States Government. And the recovery provision, 3730(d)(1), determines how much if anything a relator may share in the Government's recovery. In this case, whether where the Government fully supports the relator, I would submit that the interests of the statute and the interests of the United States are fully satisfied. And that is because Mr. Stone is the paradigm not parasitic relator. He had knowledge firsthand from his six years at Rockwell of a pattern, Justice Kennedy, a pattern of criminal conduct and a pattern of Rockwell concealing that information.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35990 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Unfortunately, it was not the criminal conduct that was ultimately -- it was not the manner of criminal conduct that was ultimately the basis on which the Government proceeded? He knew about this bad pipe, right? Or he said that this was a bad pipe system? He didn't say anything as I understand it about their not adding enough cement which is the theory that went to the jury.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35991 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, I would beg to differ on that. Mr. Stone in his affidavit at 179 in the joint appendix and also in his disclosure statement, which is at 29 -- I'm sorry, 174 and 175 of the joint appendix, and the disclosure statement at 290, what he described was a defective design of the system for taking the sludge out of the pond. And what he specifically said -- and this is very important -- what he specifically said was when you took the sludge out of the ponds in that manner, it was going to have too much liquid, and it was going to lead to deterioration of the environment. He said that in the very beginning of the case. And at trial, what the testimony was -- and I would direct the Court to Mr. Freibach's testimony at joint appendix 522, as well as at the trial transcript at 987, the issue there was the variability of the sludge which may have caused greater inspections and may have required additional cement. And what is very important is even Mr. Freibach who is the first foreman, on whom petitioners rely, he testified that during his tenure, the variation of the sludge required between 200 and 350 pounds of cement. That's at the trial transcript at 987 and the joint appendix at 522.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35992 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah. Let me -- let me look at what -- let me look at 175. This is, this what he says. "After careful study, I concluded that the suggested process" -- this means of piping the sludge out -- "would result in an unstable mixture that would later deteriorate and cause unwanted release of toxic wastes to the environment. I also noted based on my analysis of chemical processes at Rocky Flats that that the sludge and liquid present in the -- present in the evaporation ponds contained some of the most toxic and radioactive substances at Rocky Flats." I mean, that's all very good, but it has nothing to do with what this company was convicted of, which is not -- cutting down on the amount of cement it was adding.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35993 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35994 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ During a certain period after this it was creating perfectly good blocks by adding more cement. Then they got a new manager who said let's use less cement. And that's when they started producing the defective blocks. It has nothing to do with his allegations.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35995 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, two important points. First is that neither the criminal conviction nor the jury's verdict determined the cause of insolidity. The issue in the criminal case and the issue in the False Claims Act case as to pondcrete was that the pondcrete was insolid and they were lying to the -- the Government about that.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35996 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And why did the government claim it was insolid? What was the claim made for -- as to the reason for the insolidity?
05-1272 +++$+++ 35997 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, one of the pieces of evidence -- and I would -- out of 55 witnesses and 500 documents, was that there were certain people who were using too little cement. There was also evidence --
05-1272 +++$+++ 35998 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but was the reason they were using too little cement, the reason that there was a variation in the amount of liquid being taken out with the sludge as you've described to us that he had claimed, or was the reason simply that there was a kind of standard ratio of cement to sludge and that standard ratio was not followed in the later cases? In other words, is it because there was such a tremendous variation in the liquid in the sludge or simply because there was a standard formula having no particular relationship to the liquid in the sludge, and they simply didn't follow the standard formula? I thought the government's theory was the latter, and if it was the latter, it has nothing to do with the claim that he was making that there was too much variation in the amount of liquid in the sludge.
05-1272 +++$+++ 35999 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not correct, Justice Souter. The reason for the variation and the need for additional cement was because the sludge had variations and there was too much liquid in it, which was precisely what Mr. Stone said. And every one of the witnesses testified to huge variation of the liquid content in the sludge which required more cement, and even the amount of cement that was required was very variable.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36000 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if they had followed the formula that they followed at the beginning, isn't it true that there's no evidence that even these variations in the liquid in the sludge would have resulted in instable or insolid pondcrete?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36001 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. That's not correct, Justice Souter. In fact, there was no particular ratio that had to be followed of cement to sludge. There was testimony that different individuals who worked on the pondcrete used different amounts of cement. And as I said --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36002 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This was truly even before the troubles started, even before the insolid pondcrete?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36003 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. Yes, Justice Souter. Mr. Freibach, who was the earlier foreman, testified that under his watch, he needed between 250 and 300 pounds of cement, and that there was a constant inconsistency in the sludge content coming out of the ponds.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36004 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was -- here's an easy question. Was this evidence that we read, his testimony from 175 of the joint appendix, was that introduced at the trial?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36005 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Stone did not testify at trial.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36006 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was this evidence introduced from some other source? Was the jury told there was this piping that was taking out too much liquid with the sludge? Was the jury told that?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36007 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The jury -- Mr. Freibach described the process. We did not get into the engineering detail, Your Honor, of it.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36008 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So his central allegation was not even placed before the jury?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36009 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I would submit to you, Justice Scalia, that that wasn't required. What we needed to prove --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36010 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it is worse than that, though. This information was not even provided to the government, which the statute requires. He not only has to have direct and independent knowledge, he has to voluntarily provide that to the government. And I understand that the Tenth Circuit, to have relied solely on the document at joint appendix page 605, that's the only thing he provided to the government. And all it says is that this design will not work. There are a lot of things that don't work, but that doesn't mean there's fraud on the government. You don't know if they're going to fix it, they're going to change it, use a different design, not make a claim based on that design. Why is that enough to satisfy the statute?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36011 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, the voluntarily provides prong requires the relator to be honest and truthful and submit all the information he has. And Mr. Stone did that and the government has never said otherwise. In fact, he met with the FBI agent --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36012 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But he has to -- if the information that he provides isn't direct and independent information of the allegations, it would seem that the statute is not satisfied.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36013 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is correct, Your Honor, but Mr. Stone did have direct and independent knowledge of his allegations. And I'd like to go back to the discussion with petitioner's counsel as to the jurisdictional petition in this statute. There is no question that --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36014 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't want to get off my question here but did you -- do you agree that this page JA 605 was the only information that he provided to the government?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36015 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36016 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, maybe I'd better phrase it differently. Do you agree that that is the only information on which the Tenth Circuit relied?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36017 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That, the Tenth Circuit did rely on that document and did not consider any other information as a result of its ruling with respect to that document. The Tenth Circuit also had before it the awards fee documents which Mr. Stone provided to the government, and those are at joint appendix 247 to 249. It also had Mr. Stone's affidavit when he testified in his affidavit as to his meetings with the government, and also had additional affidavits --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36018 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but this -- he has to provide this information before filing an action.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36019 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor. And his affidavit describes his meetings with the FBI and EPA beginning in 1986, and that's at joint appendix 180 through 181.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36020 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I have a question.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36021 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Justice Stevens.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36022 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As I understand the statute, you his the first prong. It has to be an action based on public disclosure of information, which you agree it was; is that right?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36023 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, we in the courts below agreed for purposes of the original source provision that there was a public disclosure. I think what's important following up on the question --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36024 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You agree that it's within 4(a), that it was an action based on a public disclosure of information disclosed in newspapers; is that right?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36025 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In newspapers and also the criminal investigation, but I think what's important is that the standard that Rockwell seeks to have this Court adopt would actually require such a great level of specificity that is not in the public disclosure at all. And I think, Justice Stevens, you asked that precise question. The public disclosure was very general. And the Tenth Circuit --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36026 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I am asking you, really what I'm seeking to find out is what is the scope of the public disclosure that everyone agrees was made? Was it all newspapers?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36027 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was newspapers, and the FBI agents' search warrant affidavit was also publicly disclosed prior to Mr. Stone's filing of the action.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36028 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If it was publicly disclosed in the newspapers, does that fit into one of the categories of public disclosure mentioned in 4(a)?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36029 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. It says news reports in that provision of the statute.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36030 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And everybody agrees on what those news reports contained?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36031 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm not sure what Rockwell agrees, but I could tell Your Honor what I believe those news reports said, and they said that there were environmental violations. There were some news reports in June of 1988 about a spill on the pondcrete pads. Not a single one of the news reports about the spill on the pondcrete pads described at all any false claim or false statement, and neither did the agents' search warrant affidavit.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36032 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you're saying that the original source of the information was published?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36033 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't believe that that's the appropriate test. It's not before this Court, but I believe that the direct and independent knowledge requirement is information on which the allegations are based, and the allegations refer to Mr. Stone's allegations at the commencement of the action. After all, it's a jurisdictional provision, and it should be determined at the outset of the action.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36034 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would have thought the allegations referred to the public disclosure. It talks about public disclosure of allegations, and then says he has to have direct and independent knowledge of the allegations. So I would assume that's the important linkage.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36035 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, there is a split in the circuits on that issue. The issue was not decided by the Court of Appeals and as I understand even Rockwell's position, that is not Rockwell's position, that Rockwell's position is like our position, that it's information in the allegations of the complaint. But I would submit that that would make no difference in this case because Mr. Stone's knowledge is direct and independent of the information in his complaint as well as the information in the public disclosure. And what is important is that Rockwell is asking this Court to adopt the quick trigger that the Court of Appeals adopted because that was the Tenth Circuit's law on public disclosure. Yet in this case, say that Mr. Stone's direct and independent knowledge has to be very, very specific. It has to be of the particular false statements, and that would eviscerate the entire original source rule. And if I could just get to the point of the jurisdictional issue and why Rockwell's position as to the trial evidence is wrong, it's wrong for two reasons. The first is that the statute speaks in terms of allegations. It does not speak in terms of evidence. In fact, in the provision E.2, which is a provision regarding bringing claims against members of the judiciary and members of Congress, Congress said information or evidence, but in this provision E.4, Congress only said information. So looking at the trial evidence would be wrong by virtue of the plain language of the statute. It also would be wrong as, Mr. Chief Justice, you pointed out. Since 1824, I believe this Court has held that jurisdiction is determined at the time of commencement as of the state of things at that time. And as, Justice Ginsburg, you pointed out, it would be an inappropriate rule to say that if the government decides to refine the allegation, after all, it is still a concrete allegation.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36036 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We've also said that jurisdiction must be maintained throughout the case. Something like standing. We say standing is examined throughout the trial. There's an easier standard at the beginning, and then for the complaint; and then for a motion to dismiss, a somewhat higher standard; and finally, if the facts of -- involving standing are tried, there's the highest standard at the end of the trial. I mean, it seems to me jurisdiction has to be assured throughout.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36037 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. VULLO +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, I think this is a jurisdictional provision that Congress created. We're not talking about the Federal question jurisdictional statute. But in this provision, just like in the Clean Water Act in the Walton case, the statute uses the word allegations. As in that case, the statute used the word alleged. And the Court held very clearly that you look at it as of commencement. Now it might be a different case if we had a federal question case and the relator or the plaintiff withdrew the Federal claim. Then there would be a loss of jurisdiction. Here of course, the amended complaint satisfied jurisdiction when the government adopted the relator's claim. Thank you.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36038 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Ms. Vullo. Mr. Stewart?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36040 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: One of the features of this case that may appear anomalous is the fact that the government is aligned with Stone. That is, it's Rockwell's position that the entire recovery in this case should go to the United States. It is Stone's position that the recovery should be shared with the relator, and the government agrees with Stone. It might be natural for the Court to wonder, why would it be in the government's interest to advocate that a share of the money damages in this case should be given to a private party. And the reason is that the government believes that there are three systemic government interests that are implicated by this case and that would be endangered if Rockwell's position prevailed. First, in our view, Stone is precisely the type of relator that Congress intended to encourage. Stone was somebody who had substantial firsthand knowledge of Rockwell's environmental practices and of its billing practices, and moreover, Stone was somebody who didn't conceal his information from the government.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36041 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's all very nice, but Congress didn't leave it up to you to decide who ought to get rewarded or not. It laid down some textual conditions in the statute. And unless they are complied with, the fact that you think this is the kind of person you think ought to get the money is really totally irrelevant.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36042 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We agree. And as to Stone's original complaint, the statute frames the inquiry as whether Stone has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations were based. And we agree with Rockwell and with Stone that that refers to the allegations in his complaint. Now the allegations were fairly generalized. They didn't refer specifically to pondcrete, and they covered a wide range of time, from 1980 through to the present, which was 1989 as of the filing of the complaint. Stone subsequently submitted a lengthy affidavit in which he explained what led him to the conclusion that Rockwell was engaged in a systematic practice of violating the environmental laws and misrepresenting the nature of its compliance to the government. That information --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36043 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What if the defect that he identified turns out to be entirely different? What if there is no dispute, it's completely different from the defects that led to the false claims on which there were recovery?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36044 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, there certainly could be a situation in which the government intervenes in a suit but files what can be regarded as a substantially different claim. For instance, if the government had intervened in this suit and had claimed that Rockwell's requests for payment were fraudulent because Rockwell had misrepresented its compliance with the anti-discrimination laws, that would be an example of a fundamentally different fraudulent scheme and --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36045 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let's take this case. Did the government use any of the evidence that Stone produced? Did it introduce that affidavit which said the pipe wasn't working right? Was that part of the evidence?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36046 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It didn't introduce the engineering report. And I do want to focus on --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36047 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what else had he provided beyond -- did you use anything that came from him?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36048 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He had provided substantial information about a pattern of concealment of environmental violations generally. That at least to some extent was responsible for an FBI investigation which uncovered further --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36049 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But did you use at trial anything that he provided you?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36050 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We proved essentially the state of affairs that he predicted would occur.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36051 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did you use anything he provided you in order to prove it?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36052 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not aware of anything that --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36053 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, neither am I.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36054 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But nevertheless, the relator had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which his allegations were based. And I'd like to focus on this question of the cause of the insolidity of the pondcrete because I think to regard that as the theory of the government's liability really reflects a misunderstanding of the False Claims Act. For purposes of the False Claims Act counts in this case, it was sufficient for the government to prove that the pondcrete in fact failed, leaked hazardous substances into the environment, that Rockwell was aware that the pondcrete was failing, and that Rockwell nevertheless continued to represent that it was in compliance with the environmental laws. For purposes of proving those allegations, it was not necessary for the Government to offer any hypothesis as to why the pondcrete failed. It would have been sufficient to prove that the pondcrete failed and that Rockwell knew about it. In fact, I wouldn't encourage the Court to read the whole trial transcript, but I think if the Court reads the plaintiff's statement of claims, which is about 30 pages of the joint appendix beginning at JA-463, that summarizes the events that Rockwell -- I mean, I'm sorry, that Stone and the United States intended to prove at trial, and by far the predominant focus is on the fact of pondcrete failures and Rockwell's awareness that they had -- that pondcrete had failed. There were a couple of paragraphs in those 30 pages that alluded to the supposition that the cause of the failure was inadequate cement content. There were also isolated references to that theory at trial. But to characterize that as the theory of liability I think would be a misconception. The Government didn't have to persuade the jury one way or the other as to why the pondcrete failed.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36055 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How is it possible to say that he had direct knowledge of events that occurred after he had left Rockwell? I mean, all of this failure occurred after he was gone.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36056 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But again --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36057 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not only not because of this pipe thing that he predicted would cause a failure, not only it was not because of that. But he was gone.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36058 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Again, the statute doesn't require direct and independent knowledge of the fraud. It requires direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations were based.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36059 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. And how would he know except from published report that these blocks were failing?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36060 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ His basis for making that prediction was that he believed that the process would malfunction. He was also aware --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36061 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But prediction is not knowledge. Prediction is not direct knowledge.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36062 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think independent of whether there had every been a public disclosure, it would have been open to Rockwell to argue in response to the original complaint that Stone couldn't consistent with Rule 11 make allegations as to what had happened at the plant after he left because he no longer had an evidentiary basis for doing so. Rockwell could have made that argument, again regardless of whether a public disclosure had occurred, and the question whether it is a permissible inference for a plaintiff to say, I saw them committing systematic environmental violations while I was there and I inferred that the same thing would go on after I left -- the question that's a permissible inference for a plaintiff in a Federal civil action to make is a question to be decided under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The public disclosure provision serves a different purpose entirely. It's designed for those cases in which the relator has sufficient information to file a complaint that complies with the federal rules of similar procedure, but that information overlaps substantially with information in the public domain.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36063 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And his sufficient information you assert is his prediction that these blocks would fail for a reason that turned out not to be the reason for their failure. That is what you say is his direct knowledge.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36064 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That knowledge, but I think it's also important to recognize that the original complaint was not focused on pondcrete specifically. The original complaint alleged more generally that Rockwell was engaged in widespread environmental safety and health violations and was consistently misrepresenting to the Government that it was in compliance and -- even though it knew that it was not doing so.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36065 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you think relators can get part of the Government's recovery even where their initial allegations before the Government intervenes have nothing whatever to do with the reason the Government is ultimately giving money? You think they are still entitled to a piece of the pie?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36066 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I guess I would -- I would disagree with the premise that his reasons had nothing whatever to do with why the Government is getting money. Again to return to the hypothetical I suggested earlier, if the Government then filed --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36067 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you don't believe that, then. You think that indeed the reason the Government was given the money has to be connected with, with his allegations? Right?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36068 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It has to be connected with his allegations. And certainly, if you look at the theory of liability that prevailed at trial, namely that pondcrete blocks were leaking hazardous substances into the environment and Rockwell was nevertheless asking for Government funds based on misrepresentations that it was in compliance, if you look at that theory of liability and then examine Stone's original complaint, clearly that theory is logically encompassed within the more generalized --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36069 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What do you mean by connected? Is it -- I got -- I'm getting the sense that you think it's enough that he says, look, Rockwell is just lying to the Government in this area, and you say well -- what if what if you added a count in your complaint when you intervene on tax fraud? You found out also that they didn't pay taxes. Would he be able to recover for that, because, you know, if they're going to lie about pondcrete they're going to lie about taxes. Is that sufficiently connected?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36070 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, and I think I would put that with the hypothetical that I offered about the Government adding a claim that Rockwell had misrepresented its compliance with the antidiscrimination laws. And I think there won't be a clear dividing line, but I think this is a line that courts have to draw for other purposes as well.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36071 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it doesn't matter to you if he just, if he's completely wrong? Let's say he says -- you have special interrogatories to the jury and his allegation has always been the pondcrete's going to fail because you're putting in the wrong kind of cement. And it turns out it has nothing to do with that at all. The jury says, no, that's not the reason it failed, it failed for another reason. Is that a sufficient connection?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36072 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think we would -- I think there could still be a sufficient connection even if his reason for thinking the pondcrete failed, they all turned out to be correct. And again, we would emphasize that that's particularly so here because the reason for the pondcrete failure was not an element of the claim. I mean, imagine if this case had been tried to the jury and there had been an established rule in place that if the pondcrete was shown to have failed because of a defect in the machinery, Stone would get a share, but if it was shown to have failed because the human operator added too little cement Stone wouldn't get a share. If that had been the rule there would have been a clear potential for disharmony between the Government and the relator. It would have raised exactly the specter that Justice Ginsburg alluded to, where the Government prefers to emphasize one view of the facts rather than another and the defendant is getting in the way by suggesting that the relator will be deprived of a share.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36073 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Try this hypothetical. The relator says: I know that they've been cheating the Government because I, I observed the president of the company going into a meeting with the chief engineer and another person, and at that meeting I suspect they were devising this scheme to defraud the Government. It turns out there was indeed a scheme to defraud the Government, but that meeting never occurred. It wasn't the president of the company who went into the meeting. It was Charlie Chaplin. And the facts are totally, totally wrong. Does he get money?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36074 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36075 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does he get money just because he came out with the same charge that the Government ultimately proves? Simply because he said the company is guilty of cheating the Government, even though the facts on which he bases it are entirely wrong?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36076 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, I need to know more about the hypothetical, but my initial reaction is that that's a complaint that's easily dismissed based on Rule 11, leaving aside the question of any public disclosure. And I can imagine extreme hypotheticals --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36077 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, assume one that just gets over the line.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36078 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think if the complaint just gets over the line, that is if the evidence in the relator's possession is just barely good enough to sustain the allegation of fraud or at least to allow the suit to go forward, there's no reason to read the public disclosure --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36079 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It turns out to be entirely wrong. Turns out to be entirely wrong, so that the only reason he believed this company was defrauding the Government was absolutely wrong.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36080 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think we would still want to compare the nature of the fraud that the Government alleged with the nature of the fraud that the relator alleged. And obviously this is a question in which the Court is going to have to balance competing interests. It's possible to come up with hypotheticals in which it seems as though the relator has no equitable entitlement to a share. The two things we want to emphasize are, first, in terms of the way that the lawsuit progresses even when the Government doesn't intervene, relators once they file suit, if they are allowed to proceed on their own, they presumably can take advantage of all of the rules of civil procedure. And those include the discovery provisions of the Federal Rules. And it would obviously be self-defeating to tell the relator: You can invoke discovery and you can learn relevant information from the defendant, but if you didn't know it already you can't use it at trial, because if you use something that you didn't have direct and independent knowledge of before the complaint was filed and it turns out to be persuasive to the jury you can be kicked for not being an original source. I don't think Congress can be said to have had that intention. Second, in cases where the Government and the relator intervenes -- where the Government intervenes in the a relator's suit and the two prosecute the suit together, we would want the Court to avoid a rule that would create artificial disincentives to cooperation between the two plaintiffs. And the idea that relatively minor variations in factual assertions that are ultimately not necessary to the establishment of False Claims Act liability, if those carried the day then relators in future circumstances would have a strong disincentive to accede to the Government's request that one view of the evidence be emphasized rather than another. If the Court has nothing, no further questions --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36081 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Explain why it would be a minor variation if what he has identified as a defect in the pipe system and what turns out to be the situation that was covered up is the inadequate cement that caused the loss?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36082 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's a minor variation in the sense that it's not relevant to the defendant's ultimate liability. That is, if we had proved that the pondcrete leaked hazardous substances into the environment and that Rockwell knew that it was having that effect and that it nevertheless represented to the Government it was in compliance, that would be enough to establish the knowing submission of a false claim even if we had no idea what was the reason for the pondcrete failure. And even if Rockwell had taken the most Herculean measures to produce good pondcrete and had not departed from standards of care in any respect, if nevertheless they knew that the pondcrete was in fact failing despite their best efforts and they represented that it was succeeding, they would be liable under the False Claims Act.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36083 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask this question: Supposing he is the only source of the information that's publicly disclosed on which precipitated the filing of the complaint, and after the complaint is filed discovery reveals other violations of law on which the Government prevails, but they do not prevail on the theory of the original complaint. Would he be -- come within the statute or without? The statute focuses on the information that gave rise to the suit, not on what's found by way of discovery.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36084 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, my instinct would be that probably he could still recover. I think the question then would boil down to whether the discovery responses are themselves public disclosures such that they would trigger a new original source.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36085 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Assuming we only look at the public information at the time the complaint is filed.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36086 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STEWART +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, probably that question would raise no public disclosure issue to begin with, because if there had been no -- at least if there had been no public disclosure of the fraudulent conduct that was revealed through discovery, there would be no need for him to satisfy the original source test with respect to those new allegations.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36087 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Stewart. Ms. Mahoney, you have 4 minutes remaining.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36089 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would like to first just address, the Government's suggested that he could be an original source because he had knowledge of false representations and concealments derived throughout his employment. I just want to emphasize that the Tenth Circuit did not rely on that theory, said that he did not have to have knowledge of any fraudulent acts. It was just enough that he knew something that might be relevant to the proof of an environmental violation. And the reason that the Tenth Circuit said that was because Stone had conceded in his deposition at pages JA-106 and 112 that he did not know about any false representations and he did not know whether DOE was aware of any of the environmental problems.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36090 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What is your response to the Government's assertion, which seems to me quite true, that in order to -- in order to prevail it did not have to show why these blocks were not solidified?
05-1272 +++$+++ 36091 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think what --
05-1272 +++$+++ 36092 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It just had to show that they weren't. So it doesn't matter whether they were using his theory or too little cement. It doesn't matter.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36093 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, the point is that Mr. Stone wasn't there when the manufacturing problems occurred, so he didn't actually have direct knowledge that pondcrete was leaking. That's the real point. What they're really saying is that his theory about why it might leak some day didn't turn out to be important to the gravamen of the claim. This is a fraud claim. He didn't know anything about fraud and he couldn't have known they were leaking at the time, 5 years later because he wasn't there. And the statute requires direct knowledge. The Government's suggestion that somehow Rule 11 will be the basis on which we can sort out who's an original source and who's not strikes me as rather odd. First of all, nothing hardly ever gets dismissed on Rule 11 grounds. And this is a jurisdictional statute that requires direct knowledge. A relator could read an indictment and satisfy Rule 10 just by copying the allegations. Does that count? I think that direct knowledge means there can't be undue conjecture. The only thing that he said he knew, even though it wasn't the gravamen of the claim, was clearly based upon conjecture, a belief that in his opinion this pipe would not work. And then when we get to the trial, there were 55 witnesses. Stone had not identified a single one of them as a person with relevant knowledge at the outset of the case when he answered his interrogatory responses. In addition, every person -- no person he identified testified at the case. He identified four documents that he said were key. None of them were introduced. He knew nothing about what went to trial. In addition, I'd like to focus on the "voluntarily provide". That is a separate ground for reversal in this case, and would emphasize that the Tenth Circuit said the engineering order that refers to removal of sludge and says in my opinion this won't work, that's all it says -- the Tenth Circuit says that's fine. The district court made a factual finding that Stone had not communicated his concerns to the Government about pondcrete, saltcrete, or spray irrigation, the three theories issues at issue at trial here.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36094 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There were other documents. He said there were other documents and the district court said sorry, you came up with that too late, I'm not going to look at the other documents.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36095 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, what they're referring to is the affidavit, I think. He filed an affidavit at the outset of the case when Rockwell filed the motion to dismiss and then tried to do a new one 10 years later that was rejected. Thank you very much.
05-1272 +++$+++ 36096 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you Ms. Mahoney. The case is submitted.
05-128 +++$+++ 36100 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument first today in 05-128, Howard Delivery Service v. Zurich American Insurance Company. Mr. Strain.
05-128 +++$+++ 36102 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: We are here about a bankruptcy priority, and bankruptcy priorities must be clearly granted by statute or they are not granted at all. That's the first principle of bankruptcy law that this Court has laid down, that equal priority, that equal distribution is the first principle, and every priority is a deviation from that first principle, and therefore, they must be clearly set out in the statute. This Court has been very clear over and over on those bedrock principles. Applying them here, Zurich must demonstrate that its workers' comp insurance policy receivables are clearly included within the statutory phrase of 507(a)(4), contributions to an employee benefit plan arising from services rendered within 180 days. Judge Niemeyer -- Judge Niemeyer followed those principles, those bedrock principles of this Court. The two concurring opinions below did not follow nor even mention those principles, and that led them to err, we -- we submit.
05-128 +++$+++ 36103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can I get you to step back just -- the presumption that you began with. What -- what's your strongest authority for that? The first thing you cite in your brief is a dissenting opinion of two justices.
05-128 +++$+++ 36104 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The strongest authority for that, Your Honor, is the opinion in Kothe, K-o-t-h-e, a 1930 opinion, followed by Nathanson, followed by Embassy Restaurant, and it is the --
05-128 +++$+++ 36105 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Nathanson is the -- you cite the dissenting opinion for this proposition?
05-128 +++$+++ 36106 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. It is -- Nathanson -- the -- the citation, the page citation, is to the majority -- is to the majority opinion. The principle is laid out in the majority opinion, Mr. Chief Justice. And Nathanson majority opinion relied on Kothe, and Nathanson majority opinion was followed in 1959 by this Court in Embassy Restaurants, and followed in 1968 by this Court in Joint Industries Board also dealing with bankruptcy priorities. That is the bedrock principles in the -- of the majority decisions of -- of this case -- of this Court. And what we have here, Your Honor and members of the Court, is that a -- an insurance policy -- what we're talking about here is an insurance policy, and the statutory language refers to an employee benefit plan. We don't even have a plan here. We have a policy. There's a citation in the Zurich brief at page 20 to this Court's opinion in Pegram v. Herdrich, which I think drives that point home. It is an incomplete citation. The omitted language from the Zurich brief is as follows. From page --
05-128 +++$+++ 36107 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where -- where is the unomitted language? What -- what page of the brief are you quoting from?
05-128 +++$+++ 36108 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's on page 20, Your Honor, of Zurich. Citing to page 223 from this Court's opinion in Pegram, the omitted language, which comes in the middle of the quotation given at page 20, is as follows. Thus, when employers contract with an HMO to provide benefits to employees subject to ERISA, the provisions of documents that set up the HMO are not, as such, an ERISA plan. Now, that is what our case is, an insurance policy that incorporates a duty to pay benefits subject to workers' comp laws of the different States. So even under the citation in -- the full citation in Pegram, it is seriously questionable whether this insurance policy is a plan at all. The statute requires an employee benefit plan. The -- this Court requires that it be clear from the statute that this insurance policy is itself a plan.
05-128 +++$+++ 36109 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, ERISA -- ERISA makes it very clear that -- that a plan to pay insurance for employee benefits, whether it's disability or retirement or whatever else, is an employee benefit plan and -- and explicitly excludes workmen's comp because otherwise it would fall within that definition of an employee benefit plan.
05-128 +++$+++ 36110 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe that is -- is correct, Justice Scalia.
05-128 +++$+++ 36111 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I know that's a different statute. I'm not saying that the -- that the definitions of that statute have to apply here, but the definitions of that statute at least demonstrate that it is a permissible use of the -- of -- of the term employee benefit plan.
05-128 +++$+++ 36112 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I disagree with you, Justice Scalia --
05-128 +++$+++ 36113 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Tell me why.
05-128 +++$+++ 36114 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- to this -- to this extent. The definition of employee benefit plan under ERISA is in two parts: a section (a), which is a -- which is a listing; and a section (b), which is incorporation of provisions of the Taft-Hartley law. And it's under the section (b), the incorporation of provisions of the Taft-Hartley law, that workers' compensation comes in. And, of course it is then excluded by -- by ERISA. But a -- the ERISA definition does not demonstrate that a -- an insurance policy is a plan. This Court has dealt with the issue under ERISA of whether everything scheduled in ERISA is a plan or not. In the Massachusetts v. Morash decision, this Court determined whether a vacation -- unpaid vacation policy was a plan under the definition of ERISA, and this Court held that it was not. So it is clear from this Court's precedent that whether or not something is listed in ERISA, even if it applied -- in that case, ERISA applied; in this case it does not -- even if it applied, would not qualify as a plan.
05-128 +++$+++ 36115 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would it -- would it if the employer were self-insured? Can you be self-insured for workers' comp?
05-128 +++$+++ 36116 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The employer can be self-insured for workers' --
05-128 +++$+++ 36117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would that be a plan then?
05-128 +++$+++ 36118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it would not, Your Honor, because the self-insurance for workers' comp, as I understand them, what they normally do is, just as the Court referred to in that omitted section of the Pegram opinion, is it simply is -- is an agreement that it will provide the necessary wherewithal and bonding to pay the benefits as specified, as they may change from time to time in a State statute. There is none of the other things, as I understand it, that the Court dealt with in Pegram which would make it a plan that are present in either a workers' compensation insurance policy or a self-insurance program, as is permitted and --
05-128 +++$+++ 36119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So it would be an employee benefit program, but not a plan.
05-128 +++$+++ 36120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would be, Your Honor, or in the case of our case, an employee benefit policy. And I would like to pick up on that, if I may, because it is not --
05-128 +++$+++ 36121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Before you -- before you go on, could you satisfy a curiosity of mine? Maybe Mr. Verrilli should be the one I should ask this, but you must have your -- your version of it. How do you decide whether an insurance premium is for work that was done within the last 180 days? How -- how do you calculate it, whether that characteristic of the -- of the statute is complied with?
05-128 +++$+++ 36122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't know that there is any good way to do that, and I think that's one of the anomalies in trying to superimpose an insurance policy under the rubric of an employee benefit plan. Now, premiums -- premiums, of course, there is a -- there is a mechanism --
05-128 +++$+++ 36123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, if it said premiums due within the last 180 days, I could understand it --
05-128 +++$+++ 36124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And there is a mechanism in the policy to determine the payment of premiums.
05-128 +++$+++ 36125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But isn't -- doesn't the mechanism take into account the number of employees who are on the rolls at any given time?
05-128 +++$+++ 36126 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe it does, Your Honor.
05-128 +++$+++ 36127 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if that's the case, then -- then doesn't the premium that you're supposed to pay depend in -- in -- on the number of employees within the last 180 days, which in turn depends on their working in the last 180 days?
05-128 +++$+++ 36128 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is not my understanding -- and I may be mistaken because this policy was not placed in the record by Zurich. It is not my understanding that that is how the policy premium calculations are made, Your Honor. Now --
05-128 +++$+++ 36129 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, how -- maybe you just don't know the answer.
05-128 +++$+++ 36130 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- certainly, Justice Souter, you may be right, but we've checked the proof of claim filed by Zurich which started this off, and they did not attach the workers' compensation insurance policy to it. So it is not in the record, and I simply don't know --
05-128 +++$+++ 36131 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that's -- that's really not an issue for us.
05-128 +++$+++ 36132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I will not say that it's not an issue, Your Honor. It is -- it is an issue --
05-128 +++$+++ 36133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if you want to make it an issue, you'd have to get the -- the predicate in the record to do it, and -- and we just don't have that.
05-128 +++$+++ 36134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
05-128 +++$+++ 36135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We -- we couldn't resolve that.
05-128 +++$+++ 36136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or else establish that there's no conceivable way that 180 days makes any sense.
05-128 +++$+++ 36137 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and I -- I think that, as -- as I hope may blend the answers to both questions. I think that --
05-128 +++$+++ 36138 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Consider us together, yes.
05-128 +++$+++ 36139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We're together on this. (Laughter.)
05-128 +++$+++ 36140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I think that is -- I think that is where we -- where we are. We have a policy that was not placed in the record by the applicant for this priority. We have our general knowledge of what workers' comp insurance policies are. We have a statutory requirement which reads, a calculation with 180 days, which I suggest is an anomaly when we compare it to the statutory language.
05-128 +++$+++ 36141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is there anything in the statute which says how promptly the premiums have to be paid as it -- to -- to make it analogous, say, to withholding where you might have to pay every quarter on -- by a certain day? Does -- does the statute regulate when and how promptly the premiums must be paid, or is that just all comprehended in the terms of the policy agreement?
05-128 +++$+++ 36142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- well, certainly the priority statute does not because the priority statute doesn't --
05-128 +++$+++ 36143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I meant the State workmen's comp law.
05-128 +++$+++ 36144 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The State workers' -- workers' comp law. Your Honor, I -- I don't know the answer. I know that the State laws -- I know that the State laws vary, and we have 10 different workers' comp laws that allude to or mention workers' comp insurance policies present just in this case. So it may be that those statutes might provide some of the basis for an explanation, but I simply don't know the answer to that. I did want to --
05-128 +++$+++ 36145 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you have an employer who says, I promise to give $200 a month per worker to a fund, which money will go to pay their health costs when they're sick, that's plainly covered.
05-128 +++$+++ 36146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, it is, Your Honor.
05-128 +++$+++ 36147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And now suppose it's exactly the same, but instead of his paying $200 a month, he pays $200 to an insurance company in return for a promise that they'll pay precisely the same amount to the employee if he gets sick. In your view, that's not covered.
05-128 +++$+++ 36148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In our view -- in our view, Your Honor -- I -- if -- if I may, I think that the hypothetical you pose is not quite our case.
05-128 +++$+++ 36149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course. It's not meant to be.
05-128 +++$+++ 36150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it --
05-128 +++$+++ 36151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I want to know how you are going to answer my hypothetical. (Laughter.)
05-128 +++$+++ 36152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I -- I think the -- the focus of the answer should be on whether it is an employee benefit or not.
05-128 +++$+++ 36153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not -- I'm asking you --
05-128 +++$+++ 36154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-128 +++$+++ 36155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- to answer my hypothetical please. If in fact -- you didn't want me to repeat it?
05-128 +++$+++ 36156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. No, I --
05-128 +++$+++ 36157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then what is the answer?
05-128 +++$+++ 36158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- I understand it, Your Honor.
05-128 +++$+++ 36159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In your view, is my hypothetical covered or not?
05-128 +++$+++ 36160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I think it is not, Your Honor.
05-128 +++$+++ 36161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is not.
05-128 +++$+++ 36162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think --
05-128 +++$+++ 36163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And therefore, if we accept your interpretation, then all those employers who, instead of contributing directly to health funds, instead buy insurance policies to do the same thing, will discover they do not have the advantage of the fifth priority.
05-128 +++$+++ 36164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. And now I see -- now I see, Justice Breyer, I did misunderstand -- misunderstand the facts. Those facts clearly are covered. They're -- they're covered under --
05-128 +++$+++ 36165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, if they are covered -- if they are covered, as I thought, then what is the difference whether the employer buys a policy whereby the insurance companies pays for their health benefit when they're sick or pays for their accident benefit when they have an accident at work?
05-128 +++$+++ 36166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I think the difference are -- are several. Number one is what the employer is doing here is insuring itself against a claim that would otherwise be against the insurer. That was not in your hypothetical, Your Honor. That makes what we have here a policy for an employer benefit. It is not an employee benefit. Now, the -- the employer is the insured.
05-128 +++$+++ 36167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the correlative hypothetical would be a plan such as Justice Breyer describes in which the employer has contracted to pay his employees $200 a month for when they're sick, and that's a contractual obligation of his, and then he buys insurance to cover that contractual obligation.
05-128 +++$+++ 36168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And --
05-128 +++$+++ 36169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You say that would be this case.
05-128 +++$+++ 36170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That would be this case, Your Honor.
05-128 +++$+++ 36171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you say that wouldn't be covered.
05-128 +++$+++ 36172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that would not be covered, and that would not be covered in great part because it is an employer benefit, employer choice, employer benefit. And what we have in this case --
05-128 +++$+++ 36173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's -- that's a better way to put it. If -- if that's right, then what you're saying, as I understand it, is in those cases where an employer goes to an insurance company, they give a contractual promise to pay the employee when he gets sick in return for a premium by the employer -- and it's a health benefit or a vacation benefit, the most typical thing -- you're saying all those -- all those -- there's no fifth priority. They don't -- can't take advantage of that.
05-128 +++$+++ 36174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. Your Honor, what -- what I'm saying is and what we have here, if what you're describing, if I understand it correctly, is a normal fringe benefit. That is, an employer agrees to take out a -- to contribute to a pension fund for the benefit of the employees. That is clearly covered. That was the kind of thing dealt with in Embassy Restaurant and the Joint Industries Board that (a)(4) was intended to supplant or overrule.
05-128 +++$+++ 36175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And why did --
05-128 +++$+++ 36176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that's clearly covered.
05-128 +++$+++ 36177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- why did you answer Justice Scalia's question as you did? That is also an employee benefit, that is, vacation, sickness.
05-128 +++$+++ 36178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I answered that because, as Justice Scalia changed the hypothetical, it was not an employee benefit. It was the employer insuring itself, buying an annuity or, like we have here, insuring itself, so it -- so it could make the payments. What we have here, Your Honor, is a situation where, as it is admitted in the record, the employees don't benefit at all. As Zurich has admitted in this record at page 17, the employees are in the same position whether there is insurance or no insurance. In fact, the irony here is that if Zurich prevails, not only do the employees not benefit, they are harmed because there are in the (a)(4) -- the (a)(4) priority claimants are a total of 1.6 million, including the 400,000 of Zurich. All the others are health and welfare funds such as Justice Breyer was -- was posing. Zurich is not. But what happens -- and there's not enough money to pay everyone. What happens is if the Zurich Insurance Company receivable gets an equal priority with the health and welfare funds, then there is a dilution of the money going for the employees' health and welfare and pension, a 25 percent, in this case, dilution of that money because the employer chose to insure itself for its liability, potential liability, to the employees. The employer benefited from that insurance. In some States, it would be required to have the insurance. In most States, it has the option of having insurance or not.
05-128 +++$+++ 36179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would the same thing happen under multi-employer plans? Would not the employees typically receive the benefits even if their employer did not make the contributions that it was required to make?
05-128 +++$+++ 36180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would -- they would typically -- in a multi-employer plan, as many of our priority claimants are here, because the money is spread, the employees still get some money. But if we consider the greater whole, the money, the available res, the available pot, to play those -- pay those employees is diminished. So --
05-128 +++$+++ 36181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought there's also, isn't there, the Pension Benefit -- even if there's no money in the till for the plan, isn't there a Government fund so that the worker would receive the benefit in any event if -- I don't see the distinction that you're making based on whether the worker would get a benefit whether or not the employer made the contribution.
05-128 +++$+++ 36182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, there certainly is -- there certainly are -- in most States at least, there certainly are funds that step in if a workers' comp insurer or an employer does not make -- is not available to pay an award to a workers' comp injured -- a worker who was injured on the job. On the other -- on the other hand, Your Honor, whether such funds exist to step in and supplant the payments not made to -- in the ordinary health and welfare and pension context, I think not, Your Honor.
05-128 +++$+++ 36183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I recognize there are different schemes. The only one I'm familiar with is my former State. But did I understand from your answer that in some or many of these States, the employer is free not to have insurance? He can be self-funded?
05-128 +++$+++ 36184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Yes, that's correct, Your Honor, in -- in --
05-128 +++$+++ 36185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And is there any requirement that there be an actual fund in place or is it just a general liability?
05-128 +++$+++ 36186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there is -- there is -- it is a -- a traditional self-insurance with the overlay. That is, there -- there must -- there must be a showing of the wherewithal, but with the additional overlay, in all or virtually every State which permits this, of the requirement of a bond. And that's --
05-128 +++$+++ 36187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A bond.
05-128 +++$+++ 36188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- which is an interesting point because if Zurich prevails, we have the -- the camel's nose is under the tent because in all the self-insurance contexts, the bond issuer will have an equivalent claim to Zurich. Under their broad reasoning or broad interpretation of the statute that should be considered narrowly -- under the broad interpretation they want, that camel's nose would be under the tent, and the bond issuer would have an equivalent claim to Zurich on its policy. To extend that a little further, what Zurich did here -- was an insurance company -- it required letters of credit of Howard Delivery, the debtor, to issue its policies. It drew down those letters of credit $1.1 million. F&M Bank, the letter of credit issuer, of course sought security from the debtor, but not enough. As is commonly the situation once the liquidation is finished, there wasn't enough security. So F&M, which had facilitated Zurich's workers' compensation insurance by its letters -- letters of credit, would have an equivalent claim to Zurich as well. So more and more of the camel is going under the tent. This is a very broad interpretation with major implications that they seek and it is completely inappropriate under the bedrock principles of approaches to priorities under bankruptcy law.
05-128 +++$+++ 36189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if there were letters of credit, why is Zurich injured? Because the letters of credit were not large enough to cover the premium liability?
05-128 +++$+++ 36190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They -- they were not, Your Honor. They were not.
05-128 +++$+++ 36191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ See, what I don't understand --
05-128 +++$+++ 36192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Strain --
05-128 +++$+++ 36193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Strain, you -- you mentioned --
05-128 +++$+++ 36194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in -- in your brief, you seem to put considerable stress on something that I haven't heard you say one word about so far, and that is that these -- workers' compensation is State-mandated. They're not negotiated or even employer-determined benefits. They are whatever the law prescribes. And you haven't -- haven't mentioned that, so I'm wondering where that fits into your picture.
05-128 +++$+++ 36195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- I haven't mentioned it. I'll take this opportunity to mention it, Justice Ginsburg, because it is a very important point. We know that in the statute -- (a)(4) we're talking about -- section (a)(3) -- these are numberings before 2005 amendment to the act. The language stayed the same. The numbers were -- are different. But there are two that work together. The (a)(3) priority for wages for the employees and the --
05-128 +++$+++ 36196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where does (a)(3) appear? There -- there was that discussion in your brief, and I'm darned if I could find (a)(3).
05-128 +++$+++ 36197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Section (a)(3), Your Honor. I'll refer you, if I may, to the brief of amicus at page 11, and that's why I mentioned, Your Honor, that there is a new numbering because the numbering in the amicus brief is using the 2005 numbering in the revised statute. And what is listed there as (a)(4) is the wages priority, and at the next page, (a)(5) is the priority that we're talking about as -- as (a)(4).
05-128 +++$+++ 36198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it would have been nice to have it in your brief --
05-128 +++$+++ 36199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I agree.
05-128 +++$+++ 36200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- and numbered -- numbered 3 instead of 4. That would have helped a lot.
05-128 +++$+++ 36201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I certainly recognize that, Your Honor. The -- the provision of (a)(3) and (a)(4) -- they work in tandem to protect the workers. They share a cap. The more a worker benefits from a wage priority, the less the worker benefits from the -- from the employee benefit plan priority. And so they work together; they work in tandem, which gives meaning to (a)(4) under many of the canons of construction that -- that we're familiar with. It would not work -- it's an anomaly that an insurance company receivable would share the cap with the wages priority. That is simply an anomaly. And when we look to the legislative history, it is absolutely clear, Your Honor, that the fact of the judicial -- the statutory mandate for workers' compensation insurance is very important because what is spoken about, as Judge Niemeyer pointed out in his dissent below -- what is spoken about in the legislative history over and over again is a wage substitute or a wage surrogate that employers do not give -- will lower the wages but provide fringe benefits. So the package remains the same. Now, that's not a workers' compensation insurance policy, but that is the wage surrogates that the Congress was looking at.
05-128 +++$+++ 36202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let -- let me, if I may, ask you about other possible wage surrogates because what you're saying now seems to me to mesh with the argument, another legislative history argument, to the effect that the -- the current provision was meant to overrule two prior cases of this Court. And the -- the question I have turns on the fact that the -- the language is broader than what would merely have been necessary to overrule those cases. So my question is if the broader language does not cover the premiums that we're concerned with here, what other items dealing with -- with wage substitutes would it pick up, would it include?
05-128 +++$+++ 36203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I -- I would answer from -- in part from the legislative history of some of the things discussed were joint apprentices and training programs, by way of example, as new forms of fringe benefits that some of the witnesses wished to see to ensure would be covered. I think that sort of thing could be covered under -- under this language as well. We know from the legislative history -- we know from the legislative history that there was absolutely no intention to incorporate the definition of ERISA, and we know from this Court's teaching in the decision in United States v. C&F Fabrication just 10 years ago that it is absolutely inappropriate to incorporate into the bankruptcy statute an ERISA definition where Congress does not provide. That's an absolute square holding of this Court that exactly should lead to rejection of the effort by Zurich to incorporate -- to ask the Court to engraft onto this statute a -- a definition from another statute. If there are no questions at -- additional questions at this time, I would like to reserve my remaining time.
05-128 +++$+++ 36204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Strain. Mr. Verrilli.
05-128 +++$+++ 36206 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I think it's important to focus at the outset on exactly what a workers' compensation plan provides. A workers' compensation plan provides health insurance that pays for the medical costs of a workplace accident, disability insurance --
05-128 +++$+++ 36207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're begging the question by calling it a plan. I mean, that -- that's -- that's one of the issues here. Why don't you tell us what workmen compensation laws require?
05-128 +++$+++ 36208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'd be happy to go right to the question of whether it's a plan, Justice Scalia, because I think it's indisputably a plan under this -- under the dictionary definition, ordinary meaning of plan, this Court's interpretation of it in Pegram, under ERISA, under the Department of Labor's interpretation of it, and under plain common sense. A plan is an arrangement or program or scheme, as Pegram said, to -- established by an employer or an employee organization to secure the provision of benefits to an employee through insurance or otherwise.
05-128 +++$+++ 36209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Verrilli, there's no employer or employee, for that matter, who's doing the planning. The planning is all done by the Government --
05-128 +++$+++ 36210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ See, I -- I --
05-128 +++$+++ 36211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- because what's covered is prescribed by law.
05-128 +++$+++ 36212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think there is a plan for this reason, Justice Ginsburg. The -- what the law prescribes is that which the employer must provide to the employees. But it's not a self-executing law. The -- the employer has got to make arrangements to ensure that the benefits are provided, and under the laws of the vast majority of the States, the employer has options for doing that. The employer can contract with an insurance company to do it. The employer can self-insure to do it. And by the way, Justice Kennedy, there are quite stringent requirements for fiscal solvency and there is a surety bond that needs to be posted in order to -- in order to self-insure.
05-128 +++$+++ 36213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the it is not negotiable. We think of a health plan, a retirement plan. That doesn't have to be any set coverage. It's negotiated or the employer, if it's not a collective bargaining situation, determines what the benefits will be. Here, the law determines what the benefits will be.
05-128 +++$+++ 36214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I agree that that aspect of the arrangement is not negotiated, but there is nonetheless an arrangement that secures and guarantees the provisions of the benefits, and that's the plan. There are steps that the employer has to take to secure the provision of the benefits, here through the purchase of insurance, and that is the plan. The plan is the arrangement to secure the provision of benefits. Certainly they are --
05-128 +++$+++ 36215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So that if an employer decides to -- because his employees have had a good year, he's going to put in a new parking lot for them -- he -- his plan is to have a contract with a paving company to pave the parking lot. Are the payments under that contract's contributions to an employee benefit plan?
05-128 +++$+++ 36216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think the answer to that question is yes, Mr. Chief Justice. I think the answer is no. I mean, I suppose you could say that those are -- that's a benefit provided to employees, but --
05-128 +++$+++ 36217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems like the consequence of your theory though --
05-128 +++$+++ 36218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so. I think there's a limiting principle here and I think the limiting principle is to look to ERISA. ERISA has a set of -- it defines what employee benefits are for ERISA purposes, and it's not -- and it's not these benefits and similar things. It's an exhaustive list of benefits. The parking lot isn't on the list. Similarly, a break room wouldn't be on the list. None of those things are on the list, and therefore, I think by reference to ERISA, one can relatively easily exclude those --
05-128 +++$+++ 36219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but providing for workers' compensation through insurance, rather than through self-insurance, is also not on the list.
05-128 +++$+++ 36220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think both of them are on the list actually, Mr. Chief Justice, because both of those are programs or arrangements to secure the provision of benefits, and one is through insurance and the other through self-insurance. So I think they're plans in both instances.
05-128 +++$+++ 36221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's your answer to the 180 days question I answered -- I asked? You know, the provision provides contributions. It doesn't say just contributions to an employee benefit plan. It says contributions to an employee benefit plan arising from services rendered, and then it goes on to say, but -- but the services have to be within the last 180 days.
05-128 +++$+++ 36222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
05-128 +++$+++ 36223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How do you square that with -- with the purchase of block insurance like this?
05-128 +++$+++ 36224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, because the amounts that Zurich is seeking in premiums are the amounts that were due for providing coverage during the 180 days before Howard ceased operations, and the reason that arises from -- it seems to me there are two ways in which that could arise from services rendered. It can arise from services rendered to the employees in the following sense. Howard has the obligation to provide those benefits by virtue of the fact that the employees are working for it during that period of time. That's what Judge King said in his opinion in the Fourth Circuit, and that seems to me exactly right. Alternatively -- alternatively, as other courts have suggested, the -- the services rendered --
05-128 +++$+++ 36225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But each of those insurance premiums that's paid by the employer doesn't just cover workers who've worked for the last 180 days. Each premium is divided among all the workers who've been working there for years. Some of the premiums are going to go to -- to allow the insurance company to pay in the future people who have been there for 20 years.
05-128 +++$+++ 36226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-128 +++$+++ 36227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, it just seems to me it's a square peg in a round hole. I -- I don't see how you make sense out of that 180 --
05-128 +++$+++ 36228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I appreciate that, Justice Scalia, but I do think the -- the obligation on the part of the employer to keep paying the premiums during that period arises from the fact that the employees are continuing to work during that period. And what the -- and what the insurance company is seeking to recover is merely the cost of providing the insurance during that period of 180 days which arises --
05-128 +++$+++ 36229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if they don't pay the premium with respect to the 180 days, if there's an accident during the 180 days, the insurance doesn't cover the accident.
05-128 +++$+++ 36230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's an important point, Justice Souter, and I would like to focus on that and I -- I hope correct something that the Petitioners said. With respect -- it all depends on when the insurance policy cancels. If there's nonpayment of premiums, then the insurance company has the right to cancel the policy, and there has -- there's a notice provision, 10 days in some jurisdictions, up to 30 days in others. But they have a right to cancel the policy. If an injury occurs before cancellation, that injury is covered and it's covered for all time, even if the policy subsequently cancels. But the key thing here, I think, the critical point is that without the priority, the -- the insurance company is going to look at the situation and say, we have very little prospect of recovering if this company actually goes down the tubes and into bankruptcy as a general unsecured creditor. Therefore, we need to get out of this situation fast. And they -- at that point, they're going to cancel the policy. There's going to be much more of a hair-trigger sense of the need to cancel policies. When they cancel policies, the immediate consequence, of course, is that the -- that the employees are no longer covered. And then, the -- it seems to me, the secondary consequence, which is also quite important --
05-128 +++$+++ 36231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You really think that -- that they cut it that fine? They say, oh, yes, this guy is going to go into bankruptcy. We're pretty sure about that, but don't worry. We'll have priority.
05-128 +++$+++ 36232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's absolutely --
05-128 +++$+++ 36233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think as soon as they smell bankruptcy, they're going to pull the plug anyway.
05-128 +++$+++ 36234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- I -- I disagree with that, Justice Scalia. I think in -- in the real common practice here, the amount that they can recover and the amount that they think they have a prospect of recovering is a very important determinant in their decision on whether to hang in and how long to hang in until they get to the chapter 11 process where the debtor can then husband its assets and can pay the workers' compensation premiums as an administrative claim. So I think it's a -- it's a significant determinant. Without the priority, there's going to be a hair trigger, which means coverage is terminated sooner, and it's going to mean for many employers that they're going to have to go out of business because you can't operate without --
05-128 +++$+++ 36235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There -- there are two parts in my mind to this. The question is what is the difference between a workmen's -- worker compensation and health benefits. I agree with you, so far tentatively, that that difference can't lie in the nature of the contract providing the benefit. Now, I know they'll want to argue the contrary, but put that to the side. If it doesn't depend on that, it depends on the difference between workers' compensation and health benefits. And you want to say there isn't enough of a difference there, though they argued the mandate makes a difference. Of course, you could mandate health benefits too, and I don't think that would matter. But if you're right, what about a -- a long-term contract for bottled water for the workers?
05-128 +++$+++ 36236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think my answer would be the same as to the Chief Justice that in some sense, I suppose you could say it's an employee benefit; in some sense, I suppose you could say that there's a contract to provide it. But I think you can set the outer bounds here by reference to the employee benefits that ERISA defines as employee benefits. But in any event --
05-128 +++$+++ 36237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, actually -- this is -- to me anyway, this is an important point because at some point you have to draw the line between the things of a kind that workers might bargain for and things not. Now, if that's where we're getting there, the history of workers' compensation may cut the other way.
05-128 +++$+++ 36238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't -- I don't think so, Justice Breyer --
05-128 +++$+++ 36239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because? What's -- what's the principle I'm going to use?
05-128 +++$+++ 36240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, first, if I can make a prefatory point, that the bottled water example doesn't distinguish the Petitioners' position from our position. The Petitioners' position is that if it's a -- if it's a negotiated-for, bargained-for benefit, it's in. So I don't think that's a -- it provides a limiting principle. And it seems to me, wherever the line is --
05-128 +++$+++ 36241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, sure, if they have a contract, as part of their -- part of their contract, they get the bottled water, that's -- that's easy to see why that's covered. But the -- the question is when it's not. It's just something that the employer does in the course of his business that has -- that benefits both his business and his workers.
05-128 +++$+++ 36242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, but --
05-128 +++$+++ 36243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It has to be arising from services rendered. I mean, it -- it really has to be part of the contract with the employer --
05-128 +++$+++ 36244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I don't think that's right. For example, in the -- in the case of most voluntarily provided health insurance, the vast majority of employees in this country -- it's not bargained for. It's something an employer provides unilaterally --
05-128 +++$+++ 36245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there's one feature of this that is -- does make it different, at least one, and that is this is a benefit to the employer in the way that the others are not. The employer -- there's a tradeoff in workers' compensation. It's not just I'm going to pay benefits when the person is injured, but I'm going to get off the hook for the tort liability that I might otherwise have. And in the other cases of the other benefits, there is no -- no such tradeoff.
05-128 +++$+++ 36246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the fact that there may be a benefit to the employer doesn't make it any less of an employee benefit. The question is whether there is a plan that provides employee benefits, and the insurance coverage provided by workers' compensation are clearly employee benefits. I also -- and -- and, of course, the with -- with respect to that tradeoff, that's -- that tradeoff is an employee benefit too, Justice Ginsburg, because the -- the employee has no-fault liability, gets paid promptly rather than have to sue and wait years, doesn't lose his or her job as a result of the injury or as a result of bringing the lawsuit. So I don't think you can make the judgment that it's not an employee benefit plan on the basis of that fact. And of course, voluntarily provided benefits also benefit the employer by making it a more attractive place to work and -- and --
05-128 +++$+++ 36247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask this question, Mr. Verrilli?
05-128 +++$+++ 36248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- better morale.
05-128 +++$+++ 36249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I -- can I ask you -- it goes back to the first point your opponent made. What is the purpose of granting the priority? It seems to me the purpose of the priority is to increase the likelihood that the wage claims will be paid. And if you -- if you win, it won't affect it one way or another, as you acknowledge in your brief. But it seems to me the priority should serve the purpose of increasing the likelihood that the benefits would actually flow to the employee benefit plan.
05-128 +++$+++ 36250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think there are four things I'd like to say in response to that, Justice Stevens. First, there isn't a textual hook for -- for that being a determinant, and it -- and it --
05-128 +++$+++ 36251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it talks about contributions to an employee benefit plan which one would not normally think of as paying insurance premiums.
05-128 +++$+++ 36252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the second thing -- well, I think to the contrary, Justice Stevens. I think in the overwhelming majority of instances, the contributions employers make to employee benefit plans is the payment of insurance premiums to secure the benefits. Collectively bargained benefits provided by union trusts are a small minority of the benefits that are provided to workers in this country. But -- but going back to the specific question, of course, as Justice Alito's question earlier suggested, in a multi-employer pension plan situation, the plan is obligated by law to provide all vested pension benefits whether or not the employee's employer has defaulted on its payments into the fund. So it's in exactly the same position as the insurance company is with respect to that set of benefits, and therefore, the argument doesn't draw a distinction between the two.
05-128 +++$+++ 36253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Verrilli, what -- what is your response to Mr. Strain's assertion that if you get a priority, so should the secondary insurer, that is, the -- the bank that gave letters of credit? They're just insuring -- that -- that's part of the plan too. They couldn't have gotten the insurance from you unless they got the letters of -- of credit from the bank, which is a kind of secondary insurance. And also in the case of self-insurance, which is something of a plan -- I -- I guess you'd call it a plan -- what about the -- the person who puts up the bond? That person is a kind of insurer, just as you are. Do all of these people now -- now get bumped up to the head of the line?
05-128 +++$+++ 36254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The answer is no. The statute expressly covers this. The last provision of section 507 says no subrogation, and those would be subrogation situations. So the statute just expressly covers it. They aren't -- they don't get bumped up in the line, period. I don't think there's any dispute about that. If I could, though, return to a -- a point that --
05-128 +++$+++ 36255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where -- where does that appear?
05-128 +++$+++ 36256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. I can't direct you to where it is --
05-128 +++$+++ 36257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, because it's not in the briefs --
05-128 +++$+++ 36258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.
05-128 +++$+++ 36259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- just -- just as the contract isn't before us.
05-128 +++$+++ 36260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It should be in the briefs. It's not, but that is what the last section of section 507 says, that those who are subrogated to the rights of someone with a priority don't get the priority. So that's just taken care of by the statute.
05-128 +++$+++ 36261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if the payment of the premiums doesn't increase the likelihood that the employees will get the benefits, why should you get priority?
05-128 +++$+++ 36262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does increase the likelihood, and it goes back to the example I was -- I was discussing with Justice Souter earlier. And -- and what -- it will not affect employees who are injured before cancellation, but it will accelerate cancellation. And as a result of accelerating cancellation, employers who are injured after cancellation will not get the benefits. And so it will --
05-128 +++$+++ 36263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What -- what about the -- the example we discussed, payment of a bond premium if you're self-insured?
05-128 +++$+++ 36264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I think that -- I think, again, that last section of 507 takes care of that.
05-128 +++$+++ 36265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How do we know what you've just told us? Is that in the record? You're just assuring us what the content of the insurance contract is. Right? But we don't have the insurance contract.
05-128 +++$+++ 36266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The insurance contract is not in the record. That's right, but the --
05-128 +++$+++ 36267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So we -- we have your assurance that that's what happens here.
05-128 +++$+++ 36268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As a systematic matter -- it seems to me as a systematic matter, this is what insurance companies will do. I don't think that's dependent actually, Justice Scalia, on -- on the particular terms of this contract. I'm saying as a systematic matter insurance companies --
05-128 +++$+++ 36269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it has to be that way? I could write a contract differently.
05-128 +++$+++ 36270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well -- well, sure, but the contracts comply with State law. State law sets notice periods for cancellation, 10 days minimum, up to 30 days. We've cited those in our briefs. And so in most States and in many States here, within as few as 10 days after nonpayment, you can cancel.
05-128 +++$+++ 36271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a --
05-128 +++$+++ 36272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Verrilli, before --
05-128 +++$+++ 36273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I was -- can -- can I -- I still don't quite understand the answer to the bond premium question.
05-128 +++$+++ 36274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that -- there would be no priority there because that would be -- that would be a subrogated claim, and the last section of section of -- the last provision of section 507 says if you're subrogated to a --
05-128 +++$+++ 36275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. No, it wouldn't be subrogated. The bond premium -- the bonding company says we're entitled to priority.
05-128 +++$+++ 36276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think --
05-128 +++$+++ 36277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it files the claim directly with the bankruptcy.
05-128 +++$+++ 36278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- I don't think that would be a claim for contribution to the plan, Your Honor, in the same sense that we're talking about here. The -- if I -- if I could --
05-128 +++$+++ 36279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You couldn't have the plan without the bond, just as here you wouldn't have a plan without the insurance policy. It's just a different way of paying for the same thing.
05-128 +++$+++ 36280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm -- I think there's an order of -- there's another order of degree of removal, and it would make it a harder question, I suppose, as to whether there would be a -- whether there would be a claim for priority in that context. But I think, if I could, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like to return to the question of narrow construction where we started the argument.
05-128 +++$+++ 36281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I detract you just for a moment? On -- on a question of the statutory history, correct me if I'm wrong, but originally, 1934, the kind of claim that you have would be a seventh priority claim. And then in '38, Congress said no priority at all covering workers' compensation. And then when Congress restored a priority, it ratcheted it up to four or five, depending upon which version of the statute we use. Is there any explanation why, when Congress originally assigned first a very low priority and then no priority, suddenly it gets up to be on a par with the fringe benefits?
05-128 +++$+++ 36282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I think there are two significant points there, Justice Ginsburg, in terms of the history. First, in 1934 what Congress said was that workers' compensation could be a provable claim. It then said it's -- it gets the -- the seventh priority, but the seventh priority was not a priority specific to workers' compensation. It was a priority that's -- it was a provision that said you get a priority if State law provides the priority. In 1938, what Congress did was wipe out that provision for all State law granted priorities, not for workers' comp in specific. So it doesn't seem to me it was a specific judgment about workers' comp and its place in the priority system. And, of course, you didn't have the well-developed system of employee benefit plans in the 1930's that you have now. And what Congress did, when it enacted this provision in 1978, following closely after ERISA, was to use language which is identical to ERISA in providing a priority for employee benefit plans which, as ERISA on its face, I think, makes clear, would encompass workers' compensation plans.
05-128 +++$+++ 36283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Verrilli, your -- your friend's argument about the interrelation between (a)(3) and (a)(4) seems like a compelling one. What is your answer to that?
05-128 +++$+++ 36284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the complete explanation for the relationship between (a)(3) and (a)(4) was that Congress was trying to expand the scope of the priority here without doing damage either to the wage priority above it, which -- and -- and there would have been damage to the wage priority above it if wages were simply redefined to include the broader set of employee benefits -- or to the priorities below. Congress just took the aggregate amount. It seems to me just an elegant solution that protects the wage priority above, creates a new priority, and doesn't disadvantage any of the -- any of the priority-holders below. And I really do think that's the complete explanation for the relationship between the two. You really can't infer anything more than that. But if I could just address the so-called rule of narrow construction. Certainly there is a sentence or two in Nathanson and Embassy Restaurant, but those were such clear cases of statutory construction that -- that the rule of narrow construction, I submit, played no role there. In many, many more cases in which this Court has interpreted the priority provisions of the act and the code, the Court has not mentioned this idea that there's a rule of narrow construction or that the principle of equality of distribution to creditors should trump everything else. We've cited four in our brief: Lewis, Shropshire, Ricketts, and SBA v. McClellan, which by the way, expressly cut back on Nathanson. But there are many more cases. There's a whole line of tax priority cases culminating in the Reorganized CF&I Fabricators decision in which the courts adjudicated the question of -- of the scope of the tax priority. Most of the time, they find priority. Occasionally they find no priority. But in none of those cases is this so-called rule of construction ever mentioned or the supposed primacy of the rule of equality of -- of the principle of equality of distribution ever mentioned.
05-128 +++$+++ 36285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Counsel, much of your case hinges on the assumption that Congress incorporated the ERISA definition into the bankruptcy code. What -- what is your strongest evidence for that?
05-128 +++$+++ 36286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think the fact that the phrase is identical to the phrase that appears in ERISA, employee benefit plan, is significant. ERISA was one of the most substantial legislative accomplishments of that decade of the 1970s. And so I think the mere fact that the exact same language appears in both places, importantly, however, with -- without the limiting qualification in section 507(a)(4) that exists in ERISA itself with respect to workers' compensation plans. I also think that if the Court does look at the legislative history, what -- what one learns from the legislative history is that when the bill was originally introduced to -- to create this priority, it created a priority for -- proposed to create a priority for pensions, insurance, and similar employee benefit plans. The union representatives came in to Congress and said that's too narrow. We need something significantly broader to ensure that the full range of employee benefits is protected and granted this priority. What the union representatives all urged Congress to do was to adopt the ERISA definition wholesale. Now, we don't have anything in the -- in the House or Senate report saying that's what we did. In other words, we intended to adopted ERISA wholesale, but we do know that is what, in fact, they did. They used exactly the language from ERISA and they moved it into the priority in section 507.
05-128 +++$+++ 36287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To follow up on the earlier question of the Chief Justice, by whom do you understand the services have to be rendered within the meaning of the act?
05-128 +++$+++ 36288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think that the -- I think that the statute could be read --
05-128 +++$+++ 36289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does it refer to the -- the bankrupt's employees or your employees?
05-128 +++$+++ 36290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It could be the -- it could be either, it seems to me, Justice Stevens.
05-128 +++$+++ 36291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You think it could be either.
05-128 +++$+++ 36292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I -- but I don't think it matters in this case because you get to the same answer either way. If it's the services rendered of the employees, the -- the claim is for contributions to -- for the cost of providing insurance to those employees during the 180 days. If it's the services rendered at Zurich it's the provision of services during the 180 days --
05-128 +++$+++ 36293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it's not just to those. It's to a lot of other people. I mean, that's --
05-128 +++$+++ 36294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it -- but it arises from. The -- had -- I think it arises from in this sense, Justice Scalia. Had Howard shut down on a certain day and didn't have employees anymore, it wouldn't have any continuing obligation to or need to pay workers' compensation premiums because there would be no workers to cover. And so it arises from --
05-128 +++$+++ 36295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, except the workers who had already been injured in the past --
05-128 +++$+++ 36296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, but you don't need --
05-128 +++$+++ 36297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and -- and whom you continue to pay. Right?
05-128 +++$+++ 36298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- yes. But not -- but -- but we -- let's see. I think that maybe this will clear up the confusion. We continue to pay for them even after the policy is over --
05-128 +++$+++ 36299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
05-128 +++$+++ 36300 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and -- but -- and so --
05-128 +++$+++ 36301 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I assume that each of your premiums takes into account the fact that you're not only going to be paying for people, you know, who were injured between the last premium and now, but that you're also going to be paying for people who were injured a long time ago.
05-128 +++$+++ 36302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, depending on the kind of policy, that may be true to some extent. Sometimes policies are loss-sensitive policies in which the amounts owed are calculated very carefully with respect to the amounts actually of loss incurred during the period. That is, in fact, the case here. If you have an understanding of insurance, you can infer that from the charts that are included in the joint appendix, although I acknowledge it's very difficult to do so. So I do think -- I do think on any common sense understanding of the -- of the phrase, arising from, which is a capacious phrase, it really does arise from. But in terms of -- I think, Justice Stevens, with respect to your question, to get to the same answer, in terms of calculating the amount of the claim, whichever one you pick here, there's actually a division of authority in the lower courts. There's a Fourth Circuit opinion by Judge Luttig, saying it's services rendered by the insurance company. Other courts say services rendered by the employees. Since it doesn't make a difference in this case, I would respectfully suggest probably it ought not to be decided in this case because you get to the same place either way. I do -- I do think that it's important also -- I'm sorry. Excuse me. If I may just go back to the narrow construction rule. The -- the point of this idea of primacy of equality of distribution. Equality of distribution is an important policy under the bankruptcy code, but it's only one important policy under the bankruptcy code. Rehabilitation of the debtor is an important policy under the code. The maximizing the value of the estate is an important policy under the code, and specific code provisions advance other specific policies as well. So in any given case, as here, all of those co-policies aren't going to align and point in the same direction. Sometimes they're going to be at cross purposes. And what -- what the Court said in Union Bank, in I think a closely analogous context interpreting the ordinary course exemption from -- from the preference rule, was that we don't put a thumb on the scale either way here. We don't assume that one of these policies is more important than the other. What we assume is that Congress struck the balance between the potentially competing policies, that the balance is reflected in the text of the statute that Congress enacted, and that we should interpret the text as it's written without -- without a presumption in either direction. I really think Union Bank is highly instructive on that, and it's just -- it's just right and plain common sense. And that's why I think in the vast majority of cases, there is no rule of narrow construction.
05-128 +++$+++ 36303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is -- what is unemployment compensation? Those two I think of as those are law-mandated coverage that every employer must have: workers' comp and unemployment. So what's unemployment, is that a plan too?
05-128 +++$+++ 36304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, because the employer doesn't have the obligation to provide unemployment compensation. That's a State-run system in which the State has the obligation to provide the benefit, and the State does in fact provide the benefit. It's usually funded through a tax. The key difference is this is an employer obligation to provide these benefits, and I think that's why this is an employee benefit plan. The employer is obligated to provide it to employees by virtue of the fact that the employees are working for the employer. Not true about unemployment compensation. In conclusion, if I could just focus on the -- the point that it really is the case that enforcing this priority, as it is written, will advance the purposes for which Congress included it in the code. It will protect the interests of workers, millions of whom have no employee benefit plan other than workers' compensation, because it will increase the prospects that that money is there to pay workers' compensation claims. It will also advance the code's purpose of better rehabilitation because it will give insurance companies a reason not to pull the hair trigger, to hang in there with these companies, and to allow them to have a chance to rehabilitate rather than forcing them into liquidation by canceling coverage which the law allows. Thank you.
05-128 +++$+++ 36305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Verrilli. Mr. Strain, you have 4 minutes remaining.
05-128 +++$+++ 36307 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. This Court 10 years ago in United States v. Reorganized CF&I provided that -- I suggest, that the engrafting of the ERISA definition into this bankruptcy statute was improper. Almost word for word what we're asking the Court to find about this engrafting of the ERISA definition into the bankruptcy statute is dealt with in plain language in this Supreme Court decision. It is simply improper to do that, and yet, that is the answer given by Zurich to the many probing hypotheticals about parking lots and bottled water and the rest.
05-128 +++$+++ 36308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they're doing that to get a standard.
05-128 +++$+++ 36309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry, Your Honor?
05-128 +++$+++ 36310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I'd like to know what your -- they're trying to use that as a basis for separating the bottled water from the workmen's comp from the health benefit. And they're saying here's an example of where Congress put the workers' comp on the same side as the health benefit. Now, that's their approach. What's your approach to the standard? What rule or system would you use from deciding which insured-for or paid-for benefits count as the plan and which ones don't?
05-128 +++$+++ 36311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What we look to, Justice Breyer, first of all, is whether it is a true wage substitute rather than a policy to take care of a non-negotiable statutory requirement that's --
05-128 +++$+++ 36312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So if, in fact -- if, in fact, the State legislature mandates certain health benefits, then the plan that provides those benefits would no longer qualify.
05-128 +++$+++ 36313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That would be one significant factor to consider, Your Honor. There are certainly others, but that would be one significant factor to consider. That is true. And I -- I suggest to the Court that when we look to the legislative history, as the questions were asked about the legislative history, it is devoid of any reference to the commission that recommended the law, the House report or the Senate report, or even one stray Congressperson suggesting that workers' comp insurance policies should get a priority. Not one. The industry didn't even put up a representative to make that suggestion at a hearing. It is devoid of any support for putting this nose under the tent in the way they suggest, and it truly is a broadening. It is not subrogation. The bondholder would not have a subrogated claim. F&M Bank would not have a subrogated claim. They would have a claim, a direct claim, just as Zurich does here. And I think that the issue we come back to -- and I'm glad my brothers ended with that as well because that's where we began. The issue is what is the Court's proper approach to this attempt to enlarge the priority under subsection (a)(4). It is not correct that this Court departs from the idea that priorities are a deviation from the bedrock principle of equality of -- equality of distribution. That remains good law, cited by this Court a number of times. The cases they purportedly cite to the contrary were plain language cases, were Embassy Restaurant and Joint Industries Board. This Court didn't even feel necessary to cite that principle because of the -- because of the plain language. Where is the plain language establishing clearly, as this Court requires, that this is a plan? Where is the plain language establishing clearly that this is an employee benefit? The insurance policy. That's what we're talking about. Not the workers' compensation statute. The insurance policy may benefit the employer. The statute may benefit the employee. But we are talking about contributions to an employee benefit plan. Zurich's insurance policy is neither. Unless there are further questions, Mr. Chief Justice, that concludes my argument.
05-128 +++$+++ 36314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Strain.
05-128 +++$+++ 36315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STRAIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you.
05-128 +++$+++ 36316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The case is submitted.
05-130 +++$+++ 36320 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in eBay v. MercExchange. Mr. Phillips.
05-130 +++$+++ 36322 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The fundamental question that's posed in this particular case is whether or not the court of appeals by adopting a rule that declares categorically that three out of the four traditional factors for deciding whether or not to grant permanent injunctive relief will be irrebuttably presumed to be satisfied whenever a jury has found that a patent is valid and has been infringed. The rule in the Federal Circuit for at least 20 years has been that if you have validity and infringement decided by the jury, that then there is irrebuttable finding of -- of irreparable injury, of inadequate remedy at law, and that the balance of harms decidedly favors the plaintiff, and that the only issue that remains available to the defendant in that circumstance is a heightened scrutiny on the standard of whether or not the -- the public interest commands that an injunction be denied in a particular case. And even in that context, the Federal Circuit's rule is extraordinarily stringent because not just any public interest can -- will satisfy, but instead, it has to be a public interest that endangers the public health.
05-130 +++$+++ 36323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that all in Judge Bryson's decision? I certainly didn't see it there.
05-130 +++$+++ 36324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that is precise -- I think it's the only way to read Judge Bryson's decision, Justice Ginsburg, where the court says, at page 26a, that a permanent injunction will issue once infringement and validity have been adjudged, and then say, to be sure, it will not be so to protect the public interest. And we all know the traditional rule with respect to the grant of injunctive relief is that it's a four-factor test.
05-130 +++$+++ 36325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I didn't see anything about irrebuttable presumption.
05-130 +++$+++ 36326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the point is that if an injunction follows with a finding of -- of validity and infringement, then that means that there has to be -- there has to be irreparable injury, inadequate remedy at law, and that the balance of hardships has to tilt in -- in favor of the plaintiff. And then the only issue that remains is whether or not the public interest justifies not granting an injunction under the circumstances of this case. It seems to me there's no other way to read that. And if you read it in the context of the -- of the previous 20 years of decisions from the Federal Circuit, it is absolutely clear. We don't have the opportunity to come back as a defendant in an infringement action and say, Your Honor, in the specific facts of this case, this is someone for whom money damages is a completely adequate remedy. And -- and it seems to me quite clear that section 283 is designed to be exactly the opposite of the way the Federal Circuit has interpreted this -- this scheme. Section 283 says explicitly -- and this is at page 1 of the blue brief -- district courts, quote, may -- not shall -- grant injunctions in accordance with principles of equity. And principles of equity, as Justice Story said almost 200 years ago, systematically reject the idea that you will act on a categorical basis in deciding whether or not to grant or withdraw the injunctive relief in -- in particular circumstances. And to the contrary, you have to look at each specific issue. And in that regard --
05-130 +++$+++ 36327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is -- is that so with -- with respect to someone else's use of -- of your property? It seems to me very rare where -- where someone takes your property, that the court wouldn't -- wouldn't give you the property back and -- and simply say, you know -- I can think of a few extraordinary examples. If somebody makes a statue out of stolen gold, you know, the -- the old classic, I guess you'd get the money back. But ordinarily we're talking about a property right here, and -- and the property right is -- is explicitly the right to exclude others from -- from use of that. That's what the patent right is. And all he's asking for is give me my property back.
05-130 +++$+++ 36328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. And -- and Congress already made the -- the balance, Justice Scalia, with respect to that because Congress obviously identified the property right as the right to exclude. And then Congress did not confer upon the district courts no discretion to act in -- in a situation where the property right has been violated. Instead, Congress expressly adopts in 283 a very broad grant of equitable discretion. To be sure, in the ordinary case, you -- you very well may have irreparable injury proved, but the question is, do you -- do you eliminate any inquiry and any specific facts of the case and instead not only presume it, which I think is a mistake, although the district court did that and found that in this case the presumption was rebutted, but to -- but to say irrebuttably it's presumed that you have irreparable injury, irrebuttably presumed that you don't have an adequate remedy at law, and irrebuttably presume that the balance of equities tilt in favor of the plaintiff. And that, it seems to me, cannot be squared with the language of the statute. And, indeed, on that score, the United States sort of magically ends up on our side of the -- of the table because the United States says the same thing. There is no way --
05-130 +++$+++ 36329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ On Justice Scalia's question, I was trying to think of some, and I was trying to think the analogy might -- you might find some analogy in the public utilities field, the -- or a ferris wheel or something. What you want is a person who uses his property not at all himself, but licensed the public generally. And now would a -- would a court issue an injunction there? And as I think about that, I don't realize I don't know the answer.
05-130 +++$+++ 36330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know of any. I mean, I certainly wouldn't categorically declare that you have to I guess is the way I would respond to that.
05-130 +++$+++ 36331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, that's what -- I mean, that -- that's what you're trying to analogize this case to, I guess, is a person who licenses others to use his property and never uses it himself.
05-130 +++$+++ 36332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's precisely what this case involves.
05-130 +++$+++ 36333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And there, I don't know how courts do normally act in other areas of property law.
05-130 +++$+++ 36334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't know that there are a whole lot of them like that, but the one thing that -- I mean, there are two things to think about the property concept in the statute. First of all, Congress does not declare that the property interest here is a real property interest, which traditionally has been protected differently. It's a personal property interest, which is traditionally given -- accorded less protection under this kind of a scheme. And so there -- and -- and again, Congress in any event struck the balance. It didn't say, as it could have, that there is presumed -- there's a presumption that we have an injunction. It didn't say, as it could have, that we shall have a -- shall have either a presumption or an injunction in any particular case. And so under the statutory scheme here, it seems to --
05-130 +++$+++ 36335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but -- but the exercise of discretion is channeled over time, as -- as judges apply it in -- in similar cases. You're not suggesting that in a typical run-of-the-mine patent case, no special considerations, it would be wrong to say that in those cases you typically would grant an injunction?
05-130 +++$+++ 36336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think in those cases, the irreparable injury and the inadequacy of the remedy at law will be -- will be easy to demonstrate, as they have been for hundreds of years. The -- the fundamental difference -- this is important to have this in mind. The Federal Circuit adopted this rule of law some 20 years ago. That's before the high-tech boom, before the explosion in the number of patents. And so the opportunity to deal with these issues on an individualized basis that might give rise to some kinds of rules that you could, in fact, apply to the generality of cases based on an experience has never been there. We have been dealing with an irrebuttable presumption for 20 years in a way that has -- has completely stultified the ability to develop any of those kinds of rules. And what we're asking this Court to do at this point is to say, no, enough is enough. We need to go back to a time where the -- go back to the language of the statute, confer the discretion on the district courts. And it's important not just for a case like this one, but it -- but it distorts tremendously the settlement value and the process and the relationship between the patent holder and all of the potential licensees because we're in a -- in a world -- and I don't think the Court can ignore this because it's in the amicus briefs. We're in a world where if a patent holder files a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas, no patent has ever been declared invalid in that jurisdiction, and no patent has ever been found not to infringe. And then you take that finding automatically and you turn it into an injunction. Any person who has been threatened under those circumstances and told that we're going to face a lawsuit in Marshall, Texas is going to have a very different negotiating posture than in a situation where --
05-130 +++$+++ 36337 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You know, I mean, that's -- that's a problem with Marshall, Texas, not with the patent law. I mean, maybe -- maybe we should remedy that problem.
05-130 +++$+++ 36338 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I hope you do.
05-130 +++$+++ 36339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I don't think we should write -- write our patent law because we have some renegade jurisdictions. Why -- why isn't the -- the free market normally adequate to solve any problems you're talking about? Everybody is in this for the money. Nobody is going to hold off giving the license beyond the point where -- where it makes financial sense.
05-130 +++$+++ 36340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
05-130 +++$+++ 36341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why can't -- why can't we let the market take care of the problem?
05-130 +++$+++ 36342 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think the -- the market will take care of the problem. The question is under what standards are you going to apply. Are you going to say that there is no effective check on the jury system, that it goes automatically from a jury's finding to injunctive relief, or are you going to implement it against the backdrop of what Congress specifically provides, which is that the district courts should exercise equitable discretion in deciding how best to proceed.
05-130 +++$+++ 36343 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ One of the problems with the district court exercising equitable discretion without a close review by the Federal Circuit is just the thing that the Federal Circuit was created to handle, that is, you get a tremendous disparity among district judges. I don't know that it's only in Marshall, Texas that you have a tilt in one direction or in the other. So the Federal Circuit is put there not to say that the district judges have no discretion, but to try to rein it in somewhat so that you won't have wide disparities, which you very well might have if you just say discretion to the district judges and very light review on appeal.
05-130 +++$+++ 36344 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Justice Ginsburg, the -- the problem with that is that that's not the scheme that Congress created with respect to the remedial aspects of -- of the patent laws. I mean, it is surely the case that Congress meant, as -- as substantive patent law is generally enforced and implemented, that the Federal Circuit would play a significant role in ensuring some kind of uniformity, but Congress didn't then go the extra step and say, and when it comes time to decide whether or not injunctive relief ought to be granted, that it will -- that we will presume it or that we will deal with it in a categorical way. Congress granted that discretion to the district courts and with good reason because district --
05-130 +++$+++ 36345 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think maybe you exaggerate the -- the extent of equitable discretion. I mean, it wasn't as though it's just left up to the judge, seems like a good idea or not a good idea. There are a lot of rules for when -- when you would give injunctive relief and not. And -- and I -- you know, I'm not sure you're going to get into the kind of wide-ranging allowance that -- that you seem to be arguing for.
05-130 +++$+++ 36346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't know that I need a wide-ranging allowance with respect to this. What I need is elimination of the irrebuttable presumption that doesn't allow any consideration of whether money damages are adequate in a particular case. And -- and here, it's very important to focus. The -- the district judge didn't just say, I woke up this morning and I felt really good about the defendant, and therefore, I'm not granting an injunction. The district court here said, I'm making specific findings of fact with regard to the adequacy of money damages to deal --
05-130 +++$+++ 36347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but he said other things too, and one thing he said is, I don't like business method patents very much, and so I'm not going to give an injunction here.
05-130 +++$+++ 36348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's --
05-130 +++$+++ 36349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think that was proper or improper?
05-130 +++$+++ 36350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's -- that's not precisely what he said, Mr. Chief Justice. What he said was that business method patents stand on a somewhat different footing because they're subject --
05-130 +++$+++ 36351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He said there's a growing concern over the issuance of business method patents.
05-130 +++$+++ 36352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
05-130 +++$+++ 36353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that an appropriate consideration to take into account in determining whether to grant an injunction or not?
05-130 +++$+++ 36354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think probably, at the end of the day, it wouldn't be, but the bottom line is that he did that in the context of analyzing the public interest consideration and he said that didn't --
05-130 +++$+++ 36355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, then he went on and he said --
05-130 +++$+++ 36356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- tilt in favor.
05-130 +++$+++ 36357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- another -- another consideration is that this patentee does not practice its patents. But, I mean, isn't that just saying he's, you know, the -- the guy in the garage and he's an inventor and the way he's going to market his discoveries is by getting some firm that basically speculates on patents.
05-130 +++$+++ 36358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. And --
05-130 +++$+++ 36359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And if he's denying that inventor, you know, the -- what he'd give to Bell Labs -- or whatever Bell Labs is these days -- that does practice the inventions --
05-130 +++$+++ 36360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I should know that actually, but -- (Laughter.)
05-130 +++$+++ 36361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, Mr. Chief Justice, I -- I think you can -- it's -- it's not fair to pick apart each one of his findings and say does that finding good enough or is that finding enough. The truth is the district court made a series of four findings that overlap, and one of which was, obviously, he doesn't -- he doesn't practice this patent. He also doesn't effectively license. He's willing to license his patent to eBay. He's willing to license this patent to anybody under these circumstances.
05-130 +++$+++ 36362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but --
05-130 +++$+++ 36363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And candidly, most of the licensing arrangements don't even exist, and they're -- I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy.
05-130 +++$+++ 36364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'm -- I interrupted you. But the -- the business process point you give away fairly quickly. I -- I thought that was rather substantial. The whole point is, is that a business process patent is -- is difficult to define and could be very -- it can be very restrictive.
05-130 +++$+++ 36365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I think in -- in a proper case -- and I don't think you do it under the -- under the public interest analysis. I think you'd probably end up doing it under the balance of the hardships. But in any event -- and -- and what you -- you know, obviously, this case is -- is more complicated because --
05-130 +++$+++ 36366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ My concern is if you take that away, I don't know if you've got a lot left for the -- saying no injunction in this case.
05-130 +++$+++ 36367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I mean, there's plenty left because he doesn't practice this invention. He has no intention of practicing this invention beyond the receipt of money. Money damages are a completely adequate remedy under these particular circumstances, given -- given especially the fact that if -- if the infringement continues -- and remember, this is not a situation where he proposes to continue to infringe. We propose to work around it, but if the infringement continues, we're then subject to enhanced damages and all of the deterrent power that that has, plus the possibility, obviously, down the road that the district court could, on a rule 54 motion, now come back and say, well, no, now I've decided that injunctive relief is warranted under these circumstances.
05-130 +++$+++ 36368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, isn't it a concern that Congress didn't provide for compulsory licensing which this seems to have a very strong resemblance to? It says eBay wants to do this, so they're going to have to pay for it, but the patentee can't stop them. It just has -- in effect, has to license them to do it.
05-130 +++$+++ 36369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But -- but we're not asking for a compulsory license because it is not our intention, going forward, to infringe this patent. We've made it very clear to the district court and the district court recognizes that we not only intend to but have, in fact, implemented a design-around or a work-around to this particular patent. And that's what we expect will happen. So we're not asking for the right to continue to infringe and a willingness to pay as we go. Our concern -- and this does go to the business method patent because it does go to the -- to the uncertainty. The problem we have here is we don't know where the line is going to be drawn. That's why the district court said specifically, you know, there's going to be unending litigation on this because it's very difficult to define the metes and bounds of this particular patent, and we're going to have to fight over that, so that the traditional reason for injunctive relief, which is to bring peace, isn't available in this case. We're not going to have peace under these circumstances. And when you have that situation and you have the kind of uncertainty, not because of business method patents generally -- that's -- that's where I was I think probably giving up too much immediately. I don't think the fact of a business method patent is per se a problem, but I think analyzing the specific business method patent and its uncertainty is a legitimate consideration for the district court to take into account in deciding whether or not, in a particular circumstance, we are better off saying, pay the plaintiff the money for the past injury, let's see how the work-around develops, and take it into account, but without the sort of --
05-130 +++$+++ 36370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- well, tell me how -- how this works. It seems to me that an injunctive hearing is -- might be the cheapest, most effective way to -- to sort out whether there's going to be a violation. You call the parties in and they indicate what -- what they propose to do, and the judge says, well, this is within it or it's without it. It's -- it's much cheaper than a -- a new lawsuit.
05-130 +++$+++ 36371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, of course, the consequences of the -- of the process are significantly different because, obviously, the remedies for -- for contempt are significantly more draconian than -- than just a finding of a -- of a violation. But more -- more important than that, Justice Kennedy --
05-130 +++$+++ 36372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but this gives you the advantage of coming in in advance saying, I want -- I -- I want a ruling in advance that I'm not going to violate the injunction. You've got a cheap lawsuit.
05-130 +++$+++ 36373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, and the reality is the district court already looked at this and said that it -- it is the district court's judgment that they're going to require full infringement trials. I mean, that was the finding it made with respect to the balance of hardships. And -- and neither the court of appeals nor the -- nor the Respondent in this case has -- has challenged that particular finding. So the reality is the district court has made the determination that that's not -- that process is either not available or not practical in the context of this particular case, which of course, goes back to why it's important to make sure that you look at each of these cases on their individual facts rather than across the board on a -- on these -- on an irrebuttable presumption basis. The -- the additional point that I think it's important I at least spend a minute on, because the Court asked for us to deal with Continental Paper Bag, is that it does seem to me quite clear that, at least at this stage, the parties are pretty much in sync, that -- that the Court need not revisit Continental Paper Bag. The holding in that case is actually almost a sort of quintessential situation where you have two participants in the market, one of whom would like to take advantage of a patent that will improve that participant's ability to produce a product. The patent holder is not ready yet to develop that product using that particular method and, therefore, sues to stop his competitor from entering into that market. I mean, that's the classic kind of situation where you have a -- you know, where you -- where you've got the potential infringer is looking at what's going on and making a decision and copying it and then trying to implement it. And the Court said, under those circumstances, you get an injunction. But here, of course, we're dealing with a vastly different situation, as we -- as we point out that -- in our brief, where the -- at page 9 where the district court specifically found that not any of eBay's success is attributable to anything in the patents of the plaintiff in this case and that nothing in the patents that were put forward by the plaintiff in this case provide any basis on which anyone could build a business model. So this is, to my mind, the antithesis of the situation in Continental Paper Bag. But in any event, the holding there is clearly not implicated here. It's been codified by Congress. There's no basis for the Court to reconsider it. To the extent that there is -- is dicta in there that talks about the right to exclude, Justice Scalia, I think, in general, the right to exclude is one that you do, in fact, enforce with injunctive relief in many cases, but the question here is whether or not the Federal Circuit should have adopted a rule that says you -- you enforce it in every case irrebuttably as to three of the four factors, and as to the fourth factor, you don't go any further than requiring the plaintiff to show that there's a -- an imminent public health crisis. Under those circumstances, it seems to me the Court should reverse the court of appeals. And, indeed, if there were ever a case in which the Court ought to uphold the district court on a -- under the abuse of discretion standard, it is this case.
05-130 +++$+++ 36374 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why should we -- if I can get back to one of the factors. Why should we draw a distinction between the -- the sole inventor who needs a patent speculation firm to market his discovery and -- and somebody else? Why -- why should he lose the leverage of the normal injunction and have substituted for that a duel of experts over what a reasonable royalty should be?
05-130 +++$+++ 36375 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because the -- because Congress didn't dictate that he gets that leverage in every situation. And -- and it's quite possible that the -- there are going to be a lot of situations. And the Solicitor General's brief identifies four of them in which an inventor, who doesn't plan to practice the invention, engages in -- in various kinds of licensing schemes that create all kinds of interrelationships among the way the patent is going to be developed, and I think all of those are perfectly legitimate and could easily justify injunctive relief in precisely the kind of case that you pose, Mr. Chief Justice. But that's not this case.
05-130 +++$+++ 36376 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can I -- maybe I don't understand what it means to practice the invention. If -- if I -- does that -- if -- if I invent something, you know, a new -- better way to make a car engine work and I want to sell that to somebody, that's -- you'd say that's not practicing the invention because I don't build cars?
05-130 +++$+++ 36377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. But again, you've licensed it and there are certain rights that, obviously, arise out of the licensing. None of these factors is alone, I don't believe, sufficient to say you don't get injunctive relief. But I think what the district court said, and I think that this is why the Court ought to affirm the district court's under -- under an abuse of discretion standard, which never been applied to this case -- what the Court should say is, look, and where you have no practicing of the invention by the inventor, where you have a complete willingness to license not only to the world, but also to eBay specifically, and where you've never sought preliminary injunctive relief, under all of those -- and where -- and where there's serious question about the lines to be drawn, there's no benefit to be had by -- in the way of trying to eliminate the amount of litigation on an ongoing basis, under all of those circumstances, all of which the district court identified, then it's not appropriate to grant injunctive relief. We'll allow enhanced damages in the interim and even the potential down the road, obviously, of -- of an injunction to serve as enough of a deterrent to protect the right to exclude that the plaintiff has under the statute.
05-130 +++$+++ 36378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why -- why does the fact that -- that you're not practicing the invention make a difference? I mean, why -- why should I be in better shape, as far as getting an injunction is concerned, if I produce an automobile engine and -- and make some undeterminate profit --
05-130 +++$+++ 36379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
05-130 +++$+++ 36380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- from the use of this particular invention in the engine than I would be if I licensed it with a royalty based upon the number of sales of engines? I mean, they're both risking, you know, the same future use of the -- of the device. Why -- why does one situation justify an injunction more than the other?
05-130 +++$+++ 36381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I think -- I think I ought to modify it slightly because it's not just simply that you don't practice the invention. It's that you're not in the market itself because that's -- that's the Continental Paper Bag case. You know, in Continental Paper Bag, they don't want to -- they don't want to practice the invention either because they want to hold it back in order to be able effectively to use it. If they had wanted to license it, that would have made sense too. But this is not a competitor in the market. If they were a -- it seems to me you have a much better claim to a need to occupy space. That's what the injunction is trying to say. This is my space. I want to occupy it. But if you choose not to occupy it, it's not to say that you abandon your right to an injunction, but that that ought to be a legitimate, individualized consideration, among other considerations --
05-130 +++$+++ 36382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ By not occupying it, you mean including not licensing it to somebody else.
05-130 +++$+++ 36383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if you didn't license it -- and actually we have no relevant licenses here too -- that would be another factor that ought to be -- that ought to count in the mix. Again, it's not -- I'm not looking for a presumption the other way and I'm not looking for categorical rules that say that if you -- if you're a nonperforming entity, that you don't get a license, or even if you're a troll, as that term gets bandied around, that you're never entitled to a -- to an injunction.
05-130 +++$+++ 36384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, is -- is the troll the scary thing under the bridge, or is it a fishing technique? I -- I want -- (Laughter.)
05-130 +++$+++ 36385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ For my clients, it's been the scary thing under the bridge, but -- (Laughter.)
05-130 +++$+++ 36386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, is that what the troll is?
05-130 +++$+++ 36387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I believe that's the -- I think that's what -- what it is, although you -- maybe we should think of it more as Orks, now that we have a new generation, but at this point troll is the word that gets -- that gets used. If there are no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time, Your Honors.
05-130 +++$+++ 36388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Phillips. Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.
05-130 +++$+++ 36390 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The United States submits that the right to a patent is an important matter, but it must be considered in the context of the remedies as well. And the United States further submits the patentee's right to an injunction should be covered by the familiar four-factor test this Court has applied in cases such as Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo. This Court's express endorsement of the four-factor test would provide disciplined guidance and a framework for the lower courts to evaluate whether or not a patent should issue in any particular case. The court of appeals in this case did not make express reference to the four-factor test. Nevertheless, it did identify the difficulties with the -- the district court's decisions.
05-130 +++$+++ 36391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You don't think Mr. -- you don't think Judge Bryson forgot about the four-factor test, do you?
05-130 +++$+++ 36392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely not.
05-130 +++$+++ 36393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. And -- and he was just reflecting the reality that in a typical case, this is what happens. It seems to me all you want us to do is edit his opinion and stick in this formulaic paragraph about there are four factors and here they are.
05-130 +++$+++ 36394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not exactly, Your Honor. We think that there is some legitimate confusion among the patent bar and in the community about whether or not this test issues nearly automatically or not. Certainly there are many amicus briefs on both sides. And we think it's useful for this Court to make clear that this is an exercise of equitable discretion. Now, Judge Bryson, I think, was aware of the four-factor test. In fact, both parties cited the four-factor test before the district court. He was also aware of the abuse of discretion standard. That's a well-established standard and the parties cited that standard to the Federal Circuit in the course of briefing this case below. But what we think this Court can do is it can provide guidance on how those factors are applied in the patent context in this very important area. We think the court of appeals decision is correct. The judgment is correct. But we think that there's some benefit to this Court explaining why that is so, and I'd like to --
05-130 +++$+++ 36395 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I ask you about one factor in particular? What if by the time you get to the injunction stage, the -- the patent office has, you know, rejected all of the underlying claims in a preliminary way? It's not final. Can the district court take that into account in deciding not to issue an injunction?
05-130 +++$+++ 36396 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think, Your Honor, you're referring to the reexamination process
05-130 +++$+++ 36397 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
05-130 +++$+++ 36398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that, in fact, is ongoing in this case. And we think merely that the Patent and Trademark Office's office action is not sufficient. In this case, if I can speak outside the record, there has been what is called a first office action and a second office action, but no final action by the PTO. But even if there was final action by the PTO, that would still be subject to review by an administrative body, the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, and there would be further judicial review. The PTO would not withdraw the patent, would not certify that it's invalid until the conclusion of the judicial process. So we think for that reason the district court should not act precipitously. It may have -- the district court would have discretion to take that into account, whether it should stay further proceedings pending the --
05-130 +++$+++ 36399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's what struck me as odd there. Footnote 27 says that's a basis for staying the injunction. It seems to me if it's a basis for staying the injunction, it's a basis not to issue one in the first place.
05-130 +++$+++ 36400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it also might be a -- a basis in terms of how to structure the injunction. We simply meant to indicate in footnote 27 the district court has discretion on remand to take these factors into account based on where the case is at that time. We're not taking a position one way or another what the Court should do in this particular case. That is an exercise of discretion. It's subject to review for abuse of discretion. But I would like to talk about the four individual factors in this case because I think it provides helpful guidance in the resolution of the dispute before the Court. As an initial matter, with regard to irreparable injury, patent infringement normally will result in irreparable injury because it denies the patent holder its statutory right to exclude others from practicing the invention. It's the type of right that is susceptible to irreparable injury because --
05-130 +++$+++ 36401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it denies the right subject to being a damage remedy that's available.
05-130 +++$+++ 36402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, but the difficulty here is the pragmatic question of whether the district court can determine whether damages are appropriate or not in a particular case.
05-130 +++$+++ 36403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it always -- is it always going to be irreparable injury if the patentee always gets fairly compensated?
05-130 +++$+++ 36404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. There -- we certainly recognize there can be cases where there would not be irreparable --
05-130 +++$+++ 36405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So if there are some cases when he gets fairly compensated and some he does not, why should you say it's always irreparable injury?
05-130 +++$+++ 36406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, my -- our position is not that it's always, but that it normally is irreparable injury. It usually will be. And there are certainly circumstances we can envision where it would not be irreparable injury.
05-130 +++$+++ 36407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that usually will be because usually damages are not an adequate remedy?
05-130 +++$+++ 36408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, that's correct. And the reason why damages are not an adequate remedy is because, as Judge Easterbrook indicated, it's very difficult for the district court, looking forward, to determine what business opportunities are available to the -- to the licensor or the practitioner in the face of the prospect of continuing infringement. And that is why, as Judge Easterbrook noted in the Catheter case, the injunction harnesses the market to determine what the market value of that patent is. It forces negotiation between the parties, as compared to the court acting to try and develop a reasonable royalty based on a battle of experts.
05-130 +++$+++ 36409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ When you say going forward, I thought we were talking about damages for the past violation, not damages for future violations which will continue. Are we talking about that too?
05-130 +++$+++ 36410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, that's what we're talking about.
05-130 +++$+++ 36411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ About the court effectively saying, yes, here pay him and -- and go on and skip away and continue violating it.
05-130 +++$+++ 36412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, when a district court --
05-130 +++$+++ 36413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In this case, they -- they claim not to want to violate it in the future. They're just talking about, you know, the -- the past actions should -- should be compensable by damages and not -- they should not be subjected to a very threatening injunction.
05-130 +++$+++ 36414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but in this case the district court has awarded the damages for the past -- past actions already, and the question is how will we deal with the threat of continuing infringement. And the difficulty that the district court faces here is it has to, if it takes no action, as it's done now, it will at some later date have to go back and determine what those damages would be.
05-130 +++$+++ 36415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which -- when they will be calculable. You're saying it's hard to calculate them into the future. You want the district court to calculate what the future damages will be and say, we think the damages will be this. Here, take your money, and you, God bless you, go continue to violate the patent.
05-130 +++$+++ 36416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely not.
05-130 +++$+++ 36417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that what --
05-130 +++$+++ 36418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We are suggesting what Justice Kennedy suggested; namely, that the injunction proceedings provide an opportunity to determine whether or not the supposed work-around that eBay has will work or will not, and the injunction will be structured to allow it or not, depending on whether or not it's determined to be infringing. That allows the market to go forward with a determination, a certainty that eBay will have that its work-around is either violative or it is not. But our view is that by issuing the injunction, the district court, in the proceedings leading up to the injunction, can determine whether or not this work-around is valid or not.
05-130 +++$+++ 36419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there a classic case where the injunction should not be issued?
05-130 +++$+++ 36420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. There -- I think there -- this is a four-factor test, and there are questions of balance of hardship and public interest. And certainly equity should be cautious not to inflict unnecessary hardship on parties. In the case of a nonwillful infringer, for instance, that has made good faith investments that might be set aside by the -- by an injunction, there might be grounds in those circumstances not to issue an injunction. There's also a public interest inquiry as well. If the injunction would threaten national security, public health and safety, undermine core aspects of commerce --
05-130 +++$+++ 36421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Business processes?
05-130 +++$+++ 36422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, business processes are not -- the district court clearly erred here in saying that the mere debate about business process patents is a reason for withholding injunctions. That simply is not a sufficient view -- reason in our mind for weighing against the general public interest and the enforceability of patents and the use of injunctions to make sure that those property rights are secure.
05-130 +++$+++ 36423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose --
05-130 +++$+++ 36424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm curious about your nonwillful infringer. You're devaluing the value of a particular patent by denying the injunction simply because the people who infringed it weren't willful, and I wonder why that makes sense.
05-130 +++$+++ 36425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We're not suggesting that automatically that there is withhold with relief because of a nonwillful infringement. We're simply drawing the -- the distinction between a case, such as this, where there is willful infringement -- and, in fact, the party has been found to have both had notice of the patent and also have known that it did not -- did not have a reasonable basis for concluding it was not infringing or the patent was invalid. In those circumstances, the patentee takes on greater risk than the party that simply is not aware of the -- of the patent and in a sense stepped over a property line without realizing that, in fact, it was there. This is, again, a four-factor test, and we believe all factors need to be considered in order to provide the --
05-130 +++$+++ 36426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is it your bottom line then, send it back with your four-factor test, because there seems to be some uncertainty whether that was applied?
05-130 +++$+++ 36427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We don't think that's appropriate because, first of all, the -- the court of appeals did identify the factors the district court relied on that weighed on -- it thought weighed on eBay's side of the balance, and it properly rejected each one of those. But furthermore, we think that this Court's enunciation of the tests and the application of the tests, much as it did in the patent case of Pfaff v. Wells Electronics 3 years ago, could provide very useful guidance in terms of how this test applies in a specific, concrete context. But the factors that the court of appeals relied on here and rejected, found insufficient were really quite right. First of all, there should not be an automatic distinction between a party that practices the patent and one that licenses it. They both have --
05-130 +++$+++ 36428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There isn't an automatic distinction, but a person who licenses a patent and who is licensing a patent that probably won't be developed very much beyond what it is -- it's fairly easy to -- I'll ask Mr. Waxman.
05-130 +++$+++ 36429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MINEAR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Your Honor. (Laughter.)
05-130 +++$+++ 36430 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Minear. Mr. Waxman.
05-130 +++$+++ 36432 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I -- I can anticipate at least one question. Let me just say at the outset -- (Laughter.)
05-130 +++$+++ 36433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that long, perhaps centuries, before Justice Story ever wrote his commentaries on equity, it has been firmly, unequivocally established that a final judgment, not -- we're not talking about an interlocutory order, but a final judgment of patent infringement yields an injunction in all but the very rare case. And that settled regime is not an exception to traditional equitable principles. It's an application of those principles. Equity, as this Court has reminded us over and over again, including in the Weinberger and the Amoco cases -- equity first takes account of the nature of both the right at stake and the violation. And because the only right that a patent provides under U.S. law is a limited-term right to exclude others from practicing the invention, infringement produces an injury that is both, A, irreparable by its nature and, B, continuing in the nature of a continuing trespass to chattels. And under traditional equity principles, a showing of either of those things, either irreparable injury or a continuing harm, warrants an injunction in the owner's favor unless the offending party can marshal very strong equities otherwise. That is the settled rule. Now, no such showing could be made in this case. The jury found, by clear and convincing evidence, that eBay had willfully infringed the '265 patent, that it knew about it, and it had no good faith belief either that the patent was invalid or that it was not infringing. The jury was told that if it found either of those things, it could not find willfulness, and it found willfulness by clear and convincing evidence.
05-130 +++$+++ 36434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We also know by now that the patent office has rejected all of the claims of the patent. The staff.
05-130 +++$+++ 36435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- what we know is that -- that is correct, Mr. Chief Justice, with the following clarification, that the office action, as Mr. Minear has indicated, represents a -- an initial judgment by a staff member in the office. And what -- what is quite -- and it is -- doesn't represent even the PTO's final judgment in the case, but what is really revealing here is that reexamination is a process that was invoked by eBay. And as we point out in our brief, typically if a competitor is concerned or doubts the validity of a patent, it will invoke reexamination, ask the PTO to reexamine it when it first learns about it. eBay not only didn't invoke reexamination, it cited the '265 patent at least 24 times years before. It then came to MercExchange and offered to buy it.
05-130 +++$+++ 36436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that a factor that a district court could take into account in deciding whether to issue an injunction?
05-130 +++$+++ 36437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't --
05-130 +++$+++ 36438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Say the injunction question came up right now, today. Could the district court say, well, the patent office staff has rejected every claim of this patent, and I'm going to take that into account in deciding whether to put eBay out of business?
05-130 +++$+++ 36439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that -- the case that the U.S. cites in its footnote is an example where reexamination processes are underway when the case is first filed or when it's pending in the district court, and the district judge certainly has the discretion to say, I don't want to get into a -- a fight here about separation of powers and Hayburns case. Let's let the reexam proceed, and then we'll have a trial. In this case, eBay waited not only until it was sued and not only until it was found to have willfully infringed this patent, but in the middle of the appeals process. It then comes running in and a rule that would allow a district judge now to give notice of that in denying an injunction would basically be a -- an open invitation for everybody to go ahead and try and win at trial, go through the whole multi-year process, and if you don't, just put it into reexam. This -- although the reexamination is required to be -- is required to proceed with, quote, special dispatch under the statute, this reexamination of the '265 patent has been almost 3 years in the patent office and we still don't have a final action. So we think, in the circumstances of this case, where the district judge had no reason to consider reexam because eBay hadn't invoked reexam at the time, it would be an abuse of discretion for the court to either refuse an injunction or stay it in light of the fact that it's now proceeding. But that's not an issue for this Court. It wasn't an issue for the court of appeals because it wasn't part of the district judge's analysis of the requisite equitable factors. And what -- if I can just get back to the facts of this particular case and then talk about the law. The finding of eBay's willfulness in this case disables eBay from invoking the relative balance of harms. We certainly agree --
05-130 +++$+++ 36440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why? I mean, I think there are so many factors that could enter into it.
05-130 +++$+++ 36441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-130 +++$+++ 36442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What I was going to ask was if you have a -- a patentee that does only license and, moreover, licenses only to people who, by and large, will not take that product and develop it further, then it's fairly easy to calculate damages. Now, couple that with a client or a patentee who also waits for a long time, waits till the invention is embedded in a series of other inventions so that if, in fact, there's an injunction, what will happen is that the patentee will be able to extract far more than this particular invention is worth because the infringer would have to give up the entire invention.
05-130 +++$+++ 36443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice --
05-130 +++$+++ 36444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Couple that with a patent that, if you read it on page 2 of the red brief, reminds, at least one person who read it, namely me, that if this could be patented, maybe A&P could patent their process for a supermarket. I -- I mean, you'd worry about that as a judge. And couple that with all the other things that are here. Now, special case? Why not?
05-130 +++$+++ 36445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I've been asked to couple so many things together, I may forget some of the coupling. Please -- I mean this in seriousness. Please remind me because there is a very good answer in law and on the record to each of your points.
05-130 +++$+++ 36446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The main point -- what I was trying to do is I was trying to take what I'd call the patent troll case.
05-130 +++$+++ 36447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. First of all, this is no patent troll. The founder of MercExchange really did invent this innovation. He really did, as the record clearly shows, spend years of effort trying to build the system to suit himself, and he is no promiscuous licensor. He has -- it has entered into licenses, which are all in the joint appendix, that are very specialized in terms. He was asked by eBay in 2000 to consider selling them. He offered to license them. The parties couldn't come to terms, and eBay then stole the technology. It willfully infringed it, knowing about it, having cited this as prior art, having had one patent rejected as fully anticipated by the '265. And the common law and equitable principles have -- are quite clear from Story, Pomeroy, all the way back, that when you -- when you're talking about balancing private harms, which is what equity courts do -- I'm not talking about the public interest, but I mean private harms, when you have an adjudicated, willful infringer -- I mean, the jury found that it had no good faith belief either that it wasn't infringing or that the patent was invalid -- you don't balance private harms. But let's take the case in which you don't have willfulness. It's not this case. Let's take the case of somebody who doesn't try and, quote, practice the patent. That's not this case. Let's take the case of somebody who's a garage inventor who decides the way to exploit the patent is to license it. License -- this -- so far as I'm aware, this is the first case. The district court decision in this case is the first case in the context of a permanent injunction. And I'll explain why preliminary injunctions that seek to preserve the status quo are different. This is the first permanent injunction case I'm aware of that has ever thought that exploiting the patent by licensing it to others to make use of would in -- somehow be costly or disable you from obtaining the relief that section 283 and the -- and tradition provided. Section -- section 284, which is the damages provision, talks about remedies, remedies for infringement that has already occurred. The text of section 283 says -- the other side keeps referring to may, may, may not, shall. That's fine. But the purpose of it is to prevent. The operative word in 283 is to prevent. And unless there is an instance in which the patent has expired, the -- the infringer is out of business and can show that it couldn't possibly infringe anymore, an injunction issues to prevent further violation.
05-130 +++$+++ 36448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ On that very point, my question there really was -- that was the heart of it -- that I don't think there's a moral or even patent-related value attached to whether you practice it yourself or not. It's just that when you license it, it's easier -- and a lot of other things matter too.
05-130 +++$+++ 36449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-130 +++$+++ 36450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it's easier to calculate the damage. Now, at least in some subset of cases. So if you have a case where, on the one hand, it's easier to calculate the damage remedy, and at the same time you fear that to issue an injunction will produce a harm to the other side way out of proportion to, in fact, the value that's being lost by infringing on the patent, then those are two things you'd put in the balance.
05-130 +++$+++ 36451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's --
05-130 +++$+++ 36452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So the -- other things being equal --
05-130 +++$+++ 36453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In the case of a nonwillful infringer, a court in --
05-130 +++$+++ 36454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. Willful, willful. It wouldn't matter willful or nonwillful, because if he's willful, the reason that he might be willful is he thinks that the patentee is holding him up.
05-130 +++$+++ 36455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You know, the -- the -- there are 52 self-proclaimed intellectual property professors that filed a brief written by Professor Lemley in support of eBay in this case. Professor Lemley testified under oath to Congress that, even though there are problems with patent trolls, in the case of a willful infringer, the law -- equity doesn't balance private harms. But even if that were wrong, I acknowledge that in balancing, there may be cases in which you can show a vastly disproportionate harm. Okay? I mean, the other side has amicus briefs that come up with these hypothetical scenarios about, you know, one little aspect of a computer chip that has 30,000 components to it. Note, A, that all of those are hypothetical, and B, I'll explain why it's a problem of extremely limited circumstances. But, of course, equity courts can decide that, just as they can decide whether the -- the, quote, innocent patent holder is guilty of laches, unclean hands, estoppel, all of these other equitable considerations that aren't captured by this formulaic four-factor test but that equity courts, including district courts sitting under -- under 283, consider. But this is not the case of some profligate licensor. This is somebody who has licensed with specific provisions. The other side says, well, there are no operative licenses, suggesting somehow that the AutoTrader license, which is one of our examples, is in fact invalid. That came up in their reply brief. It is not correct. It is absolutely true that eBay will not -- the '265 patent is included by that license. It relates to the field of use of auto sales. It provides specifically that eBay -- that MercExchange cannot receive royalties unless it enforces this patent within the field of use. There is no doubt that -- that MercExchange will not be able to start getting patent royalties from AutoTrader unless and until it obtains this injunction. And for example --
05-130 +++$+++ 36456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman, you mentioned, in -- in responding to the suggestion that we're dealing with a troll, you described -- what exactly is the invention here?
05-130 +++$+++ 36457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the invention is a -- it's -- it's not a business method. It doesn't claim methods. It claims a system, an apparatus for an electric market for the sale of goods via a network.
05-130 +++$+++ 36458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Electric. I mean, it's not like --
05-130 +++$+++ 36459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Electronic market.
05-130 +++$+++ 36460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- he invented the, you know, internal combustion engine or anything. It's very vague I think, and this is one of the considerations --
05-130 +++$+++ 36461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-130 +++$+++ 36462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the district court mentioned. The exact parameters of when it was going to be infringed and when it wasn't were amorphous. And so isn't that a factor the district court can take into account in deciding whether to issue an injunction because it's going to be hard to issue an injunction to define exactly when it's going to be violated and when it's not?
05-130 +++$+++ 36463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Mr. Chief Justice, if it turns out that it's too hard and -- and the -- and a specific injunction can't be written, rule 65(d) requires that an injunction not issue. And in fact, as we've cited in pages 17 and 18 and, I think, 19 of our brief, the Federal Circuit has, in fact, overruled injunctions that were insufficiently precise to satisfy rule 65. But the claim of imprecision here is -- look, I'm not a software developer and I have reason to believe that neither is Your Honor, and I -- I can't -- (Laughter.)
05-130 +++$+++ 36464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- explain specifically what this claims. It's laid out very carefully in --
05-130 +++$+++ 36465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I may not be a software developer, but as I read the invention, it's displaying pictures of your wares on a computer network and, you know, picking which ones you want and buying them. I -- I might have been able to do that.
05-130 +++$+++ 36466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well -- (Laughter.)
05-130 +++$+++ 36467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'll say respectfully that that is not a fair characterization of the innovation here, the actual innovation. But let me just say, for purposes of this case, there is no challenge continuing to the validity of this patent. It was challenged before the district court and on appeal on grounds of an inadequate written description, et cetera, et cetera, and upheld. There was a Markman hearing in which the district court construed the patent, added certain claim limitation terms that eBay wanted and we thought were not fairly in it. But significantly, there was never -- never -- a claim to the judge -- and this is an issue for the judge under section 112, paragraph 2 -- of -- of invalidity for indefiniteness.
05-130 +++$+++ 36468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but the patent office staff has rejected all the claims. I don't know on what grounds.
05-130 +++$+++ 36469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The patent office -- none of the claims have been rejected on indefinite grounds. They have been rejected, as I understand it, certainly in this patent, for obviousness under prior art, which is all the same prior art that was presented to an Article III court here and that a jury entered a finding on. There are a host of questions that undoubtedly will be presented in the case, if it ever happens, in which a final -- Patent and Trademark Office, on the validity of a patent, contravenes something that a -- a final judgment of an Article III court. But that's not this case. And we certainly agree with the United States that when -- if the judgment is affirmed, the case will go back and the district court will then have to address a point it hasn't addressed yet, which is is the -- is the -- the permanent injunction proposed by MercExchange adequate or inadequate and how can it be made specific, and this supposed work-around -- does it or doesn't it violate the terms of the injunction. I mean, the district judge actually found bad faith -- this is page, I think, 71 of the petition appendix -- of eBay in its conduct in the district court of proclaiming that for $8,000 -- its experts testified that for $8,000, they could work around or design around this problem and there wouldn't be an infringement. But they didn't do it. And they didn't -- they certainly didn't appear to have done it in the Federal Circuit because their brief in the Federal Circuit never mentions it, and the Federal Circuit opinion surely would have said, they've designed around this problem and, you know, therefore this, that, or the other. Even in this Court, eBay has said in its -- in its opening brief at page 43, here there is a possibility that the infringer can develop a work-around. Well --
05-130 +++$+++ 36470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Waxman, could you help me with something I just realized I have no conception of here? What kind of -- what do these injunctions say? Do they just say don't infringe patent '265 anymore, or do they give a list of things you cannot do and a list of articles you cannot make and so forth?
05-130 +++$+++ 36471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You couldn't just say don't infringe anymore because rule 65(d) requires specificity and precision. Ordinarily what happens in these cases is there's -- you know, there's usually been a claimed -- a detailed, claimed construction following a Markman hearing. There have been jury instructions. The jury instructions have to specifically describe to the jury on what basis it's to conclude who is right --
05-130 +++$+++ 36472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The thought just occurs to me and I -- frankly, with all the briefs we've had, I feel kind of stupid not to have thought it before. But it seems to me a great difference might turn on what exactly the injunction provided. Some injunctions must be -- might be much more burdensome than some others. If they're not all fungible, that's certainly true.
05-130 +++$+++ 36473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Certainly not. And the terms of an injunction are appealable, and the Federal Circuit has reviewed actual terms of permanent injunctions and reversed a number of them and said this is -- this doesn't satisfy rule 65 or it doesn't meet other requirements. But in the -- in the context of this case, it is so critical that the judgment be affirmed, not vacated, because this is a real inventor. This is somebody who really did try to put it in place. This is somebody who eBay approached and then, when they didn't buy it, appropriated the technology, and the validity and infringement are final. They aren't even challenged in this Court. And any suggestion that uncertainty exists on the facts of this case would dramatically destabilize settled law, licensing practices, and the investment-backed expectations of patent holders, large and small, the sole -- you know, hall of fame inventors that are in the Cooper brief filed in support of us and big, integrated companies like GE and Johnson & Johnson that have also filed on our side.

05-130 +++$+++ 36476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ One -- one short question. Is the draft of the injunction that you want in the record?
05-130 +++$+++ 36477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WAXMAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is in the court of appeals record, but not the joint appendix. But it certainly will have to be changed because the court of appeals invalidated the '176 patent, which the jury found had been infringed, and therefore, it's -- it will need to be revisited when the case goes back for the entry of an injunction. Thank you, Your Honor.
05-130 +++$+++ 36478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Mr. Phillips, you have 6 minutes remaining.
05-130 +++$+++ 36480 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. PHILLIPS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. I realize I'm the only thing standing between you and lunch, so I'll try to be brief at this point. Justice Stevens, with respect to the place in the record, this is in the joint appendix and the court of appeals at A6523 -- 62523. That's the proposed permanent injunction, and I won't purport to read the whole thing, but it starts off with anything directly or indirectly, and it goes on for three pages. It is, I think, fairly characterized as a very broad injunction. The -- I think it's important, after Mr. Waxman's challenge to the conduct of eBay in this case, to -- to recognize that willfulness in the patent context has a meaning different from willfulness in any other context. And it is recognized that we're talking about simply a failure to satisfy a duty to check out and find a lawyer's opinion that a particular infringement has not taken place or that the patent is not valid. And when you do that, you of course incur the risk that you will also waive your attorney-client privilege. So there's a risk to it. And that's the willfulness that we're talking about here. With respect to the notion of stealing this patent, let's go back to what the district court specifically held on page 68 of the appendix. Where the defendants maintain that their success did not arise from the use of anything contained in the plaintiff's patents and the defendants argued that the patents offered no business or engineering guidance which the defendants could copy, and this court agrees with that. That's not the kind of bad faith or willfulness -- it's the reason why the court didn't grant enhanced damages. It's the reason why the court didn't grant attorney's fees in this particular case, and it doesn't provide a reason for simply jettisoning three out of the four factors that ought to be applied in the traditional -- in the traditional test. And, Justice Breyer, you asked the question, what are you going to do with a situation where you have the embedded patent and you have the case like this one where we're going along with our process and we've got our source code and we've done all of the hard work, and they go along and come up with some sort of more vague idea and show up at our doorstep and, one, claim that we've got to stop doing what we're doing, or, worse in other cases, we're going to find situations where it's embedded in a manufacturing process. Mr. Waxman says, well, in that situation equity will step in. Not so under the Federal Circuit's approach because that's a balance of the equities kind of a consideration, and that's irrebuttably presumed to favor the plaintiff under the Federal Circuit's approach. Mr. Chief Justice, I know, as well as you know, that Judge Bryson understands the four-factor test and the abuse of discretion standard. And what he did in this case was to go through each of the findings of the district court with respect to the use of the -- of the licensing arrangements, the failure to commercialize this, not being in the business, and said, does any of these rise to the level of the kind of public interest concern that is the only legitimate consideration this court will use in deciding whether or not the district court can justify not granting an injunction in a particular case, instead of what is clearly the traditional approach of equity, which is to say, look at the -- the primary two issues, you know, the flip side of the same thing, so I'll just treat it the one way. Are money damages adequate in the specific case? That's the fundamental question that equity asks. That's the fundamental question that the district court found to be satisfied in this case. Money damages will get the job done. The right to exclude will be adequately protected by enhanced damages and even potentially injunctive relief in the future. Beyond that, nothing more is required. That's the kind of decision that a district court who has sat in a 5-week trial and has overseen this entire litigation is uniquely suited to make a judgment. That judgment is entitled to respect on a classic abuse of discretion standard. The court of appeals long ago jettisoned that approach, and the time has come for this Court to say no, that's not what this Patent Act requires. The Patent Act says the right to exclude is important, but it's only protected by the principles of equity under section 283. That wasn't given here. We urge you to reverse the court of appeals. If there are no further questions, thank you, Your Honor.
05-130 +++$+++ 36481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36485 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in 05-1342, Watters v. Wachovia Bank. Mr. Blanchard.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36487 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The dual banking system of State and Federal regulation in our nation which we've enjoyed for over 140 years is one of the finest examples of cooperative federalism in our history. For 35 years, the States, not the OCC, have prudently exercised their authority over non-bank State-chartered operating local subsidiaries of national banks. Indeed, respondent Wachovia Mortgage complied with Michigan law for 6 years until in 2003 there was a corporate reshuffling and now it claims it's exempt from the same Michigan laws it complied with. The OCC through its Regulation 7.40006 has disrupted the careful balance and seeks to deprive the States of the regulatory authority that they have historically exercised.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the national bank set up its mortgage operations as a division or as a department, then the sole regulator would be OCC, right?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor. But Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Mortgage made a choice. They made a business judgment to create a State-chartered operating subsidiary.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why did they do that? What's the advantage to them having that subsidiary rather than doing this directly?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, the advantage is that Wachovia Bank insulates itself from liability, because it's a bedrock principle of state corporate law that the parent corporation is not liable for the acts of the subsidiary corporation.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So mortgage subsidiary could possibly get into some trouble that the bank wants to protect itself from and not have -- they have a certain number of assets that are subject to liability in the subsidiary, but they would -- otherwise they'd expose the whole bank to those liabilities?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor. From -- the conception behind operating subsidiaries was to separate a certain part of the business and the attendant risks of that business also to separate.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I assume that the Federal regulating authorities require a certain ratio of loans to real estate value, things of that sort. And I assume that the States may have different rules with regard to that; right? In other words, the oversight might be different. The States may be more permissive as to certain loans or as to, you know, what the balance sheet of the bank has to look like than the Federal Government is. And if you have a State subsidiary that is overseen by state authorities, you might have a different result.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Possibly, but --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if not I don't see any advantage in this great Federal banking system you're talking about, if it's Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the States do not -- exclusive visitorial powers over national banks rest with the OCC. But Wachovia Bank and Wachovia Mortgage are separate and distinct.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're not seeking visit -- "visitorial," is that the word?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're not seeking visitorial rights with respect to the parent bank.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely not.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're not arguing that because you need to see more about the mortgage subsidiary you need to see what the parent is up to?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36504 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36505 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, we're not. Michigan and the States want to be able to help their citizens with abusive and predatory lending complaints.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose that it was a national bank. Forget the subsidiary. And your State says: Well, we want to have a law here that says we want to send our own bank examiners in. And moreover, we don't want them to make any loans in excess of 12 percent interest. Fine. Would that be constitutional? I mean, wouldn't be preempted?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As to the national bank?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, of course, because it conflicts and they don't want it.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36511 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Do they have the authority to say a subsidiary is a national bank?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, they can't? Where is it in the law that says they don't have the authority to say that a subsidiary of a national bank owned by a national bank is a national bank? Is there something specifically that stops them from saying that?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Gold Foods case, the --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What is it? What is it -- I mean, what statute or what is it that prevents them from saying it? I don't know the Gold Foods case.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the point is that the corporate law recognizes the two as separate and distinct corporate entities.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought your point was that the statute defines national bank, but also defines affiliates, and refers to them as two separate entities.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I thought your point was that the effect of this regulation is to simply eliminate that distinction?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're right.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Their argument, they haven't argued -- I realize this was a hypothetical, but they haven't argued that the subsidiary should be treated as a national bank. They're arguing that they're entitled to say that the same preemption that applies to the national bank applies to the subsidiaries.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Exactly. That's what they --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Presumably, if they said it's treated as a national bank they would lose the benefit of the separate corporate existence when it came to issues of liability. If they said this subsidiary is a national bank, then presumably the separate corporate existence they're seeking to take advantage of would be obliterated.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but that's the -- they are trying to contend that they are one and the same. But they can't have their cake and eat it, too.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I guess we can ask the respondents. But is it your understanding that respondents take the position that the State has no control at all over whether or not the shares have been properly issued, whether or not certain accounting requirements applicable to all corporations have been complied with?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, that is my understanding of their position.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They say that there's no area of State law that is applicable to the subsidiary corporation?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They are saying that visitorial powers over the State-chartered operating subs is exclusively --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I could understand that with reference to just the amount of consumer loans, as Justice Scalia was talking about. But just to see if the corporation has a -- had -- had a meeting that year, has duly elected its officers under State law, do the respondents take the position you have no authority to visit the corporation to determine that?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They take the authority -- the position that Michigan has no authority to impose on the State-chartered operating sub the two Michigan laws --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But let's -- there are two different kinds of regulations. I think Justice Kennedy was talking about regulations of a chartering State. This subsidiary was set up under the law of a State. It wasn't Michigan. Is there -- is anyone contesting that -- was it North Carolina?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, you're correct.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that they have to meet all the requirements for setting up a corporation and having meetings and all that that North Carolina requires of corporations that are incorporated in that State?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I've not heard them say that as to North Carolina law. But what they're saying is that the Michigan Mortgage Broker, Lenders and Servicers Licensing Act and the Michigan Secondary Mortgage Act do not apply to them.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that seems to be a standard preemption case. It's not as broad as just visitorial powers generally. Maybe I'm wrong. Do some subsidiaries of the -- of a national bank do things other than banking, say title insurance or something like that? I don't see anything in the record where the OCC wants to displace the State as to that. This is just a standard preemption case. When the OCC has regulations that control, then the State has no authority to add to those regulations or to have, or to have contrary regulations. But if it's something that doesn't have to do with banking at all, then I suppose they would say -- I can ask them -- I suppose they say the State has authority to regulate.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The important point, though, Your Honor, is that the OCC has no independent power to preempt the validly enacted legislation of a sovereign State.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Doesn't it have exactly the same power that any other agency or Congress has? That it has the power, if its regulation is authorized, it has the power to what they say, preempt a state law that obstructs, impairs, or conditions a bank's ability fully to exercise its federally authorized real estate lending powers? That's what they say, and then they list some examples. Suppose they said nothing. Wouldn't we be in the same boat? After all, a state cannot under the Federal Constitution normally enact a law that interferes or stands as an obstacle to the achievement of the objective of the Federal law. So if that's right, or if it's wrong, explain why it's wrong, but if it's right, why don't you tell me whether the two laws that you are worried about do or do not stand as an obstacle to the full achievement of the purposes of the statute as implemented by their regulation?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They do not. First of all, if the OCC -- if Congress intends to alter the balance that I spoke of earlier, it must do so with clear and manifest language. There must be unmistakably clear language that Congress intended to authorize the OCC to preempt the state law.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let's assume I don't agree with you about that, that I think conflict preemption does not require clear language. Assume that, even though you disagree with it. Now on my assumption that you can have the law if it doesn't conflict, but you can't have the law if it does conflict, so now you explain to me why the two laws at issue here don't conflict.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, in the Barnett case and in the Atherton case, in order to have the kind of problem you're talking about, there must be a significant interference with the business of banking or an incapacitation of the business of banking. Our Michigan law doesn't incapacitate what --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Blanchard, may I ask you a question, perhaps preliminary to what you are launching into? My understanding was that you did not question the OCC's regulatory authority over a unit that it says can do what the national bank itself could do in the real estate business, no more, no less. OCC regulation, visitation, all the rest, OCC's regulations validly applied to this subsidiary that has been set up in North Carolina and is operating in Michigan; is that right? It is one thing for you to say we have the authority to regulate. Are you saying at the same time that OCC is out of the picture because its dual regulation conflicts with the inevitable?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I am not saying that. What I am saying is the OCC does not have the exclusive right.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Ah, you're saying, you started to say they can't have their cake and eat it too, but you're saying they can have the worst of all possible regulatory worlds, so that they've got two equally competent regulators, and they have to meet the requirements of both?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. I am saying that --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And if they don't want to, they don't have to set up a separate subsidiary, right? They can do this business directly as a national bank and they're not going to be subject to any visitation?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You are absolutely correct. As I started to say earlier, they made that choice and they came to Michigan, and they obtained a certificate of authority from the Michigan Corporations Division as a foreign for-profit corporation doing business in the state.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. And I would have thought your answer to Justice Breyer was yes, that they get to regulate to the extent they want to, and the state does, and if there's a conflict, the federal regulation will prevail, but what's the problem here is that they're issuing a categorical regulation saying the state can't regulate at all.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. They are claiming exclusive preemptive authority.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I didn't understand that you made this --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I just finish, please? You argued, as I understand it, correctly, that the state does, exercises certain regulatory controls that will not be exercised -- will not be replaced by federal controls; is that right? In other words, you -- that they will be unregulated to a certain extent? There will be less regulation under the federal sovereign than there is under the state; is that correct?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You are correct, Your Honor, in that Wachovia Mortgage as a subsidiary of a national bank is a registrant under Michigan law. And as a registrant, it is not subject to an annual --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can you give me some specific examples of what Michigan would require that the OCC does not require? You mentioned licensing, for example.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Michigan would require Wachovia Mortgage to register. There's a difference between registration and licensure. As a subsidiary of Wachovia Bank, they are a registrant like they've been for the last --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does that have any impact on the way they run their business?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, does it make any difference as a matter of what they have to do in order to comply with the law that they are now exempt from Michigan rules and subject to Federal rules instead?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. Michigan just wants to be able to -- and the other states -- to deal with fraud and deceit and material misrepresentation in mortgage transactions, and to have a say over the corporations that come to their state and do business.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Blanchard, if I could go back to what you were saying before this last line of questioning, I didn't understand your position to be that the OCC can come in and regulate this non-Federal bank up to the point where its -- well, can do it apparently without limitation. And where its regulation conflicts with the state regulation, the Federal prevails.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36562 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or the more restrictive.

05-1342 +++$+++ 36567 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wait. What happens in that situation?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it doesn't happen in Michigan because --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, invent some other hypothetical then. I'm talking about a situation in which the Federal law is more permissive than the state law. Which law prevails? The Federal law allows this bank to do things which the state law would not allow it to do. As I understood your prior answer, you say oh, of course, if the Federal law allows to it do things the state law doesn't allow to it do, the Federal law prevails. I didn't understand that to be your position. And if it is your position, I don't know what all this fuss is about. That's the end of the game, isn't it?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. You see, in -- we do not conduct -- they are exempt from an examination where we go in and look yearly at such things as capital assets management, earnings, liquidity. Those aren't the kinds of things that we're talking about. They, as a registrant, they are exempt from that, from an annual examination. They're not incapacitated, nor are --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Exempt from state examination?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. The state chartered corporation, Wachovia Mortgage, is exempt under Michigan law from an annual examination.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We're not looking for that. We're looking for the opposite. As I read this, the banking agency has not said, we wipe out all of your laws. They've said, we wipe out a subset of laws, which are defined as those laws that obstruct, impair, or limit the ability of this bank to fulfill its federally mandated powers. Okay? So they're just saying, we only get the ones that are in conflict. Now, they then have a list of which ones they preempt and which ones they don't. So my question to you is, give me a list here of which ones they think conflict that you think don't.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They -- their position is that both laws that we append to our brief, both laws in their entirety, are preempted.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Their position is not that it only preempts in cases of conflict. Under 12c apart, 7.4006, it says, state laws apply to national bank operated subsidiaries, which is what we're dealing with here, to the same extent that those laws apply to the parent national bank, which is to say not at all.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So it's not a case of conflict preemption. They're trying to preempt state law whether it conflicts or not, right?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You do have -- one thing that seems concrete and clear to me -- correct me if I get this wrong -- Michigan is kind of deferring to OCC in its primary jurisdiction sense. It says customers, if you've got complaints about what this operating subsidiary is doing, you go first to the OCC; and then if we think -- we, Michigan -- thinks OCC has not given you an adequate response to your complaint, we take over.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You are exactly correct. That's the Michigan regulatory --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So it's kind of a reverse supremacy. Where it's usually the feds that have the last word, but here you're saying Michigan has decided that it will let OCC go first and Michigan will be kind of a supervisor for the adequacy of the OCC's handling of the consumer's complaint?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, you are exactly correct. Our regulatory framework in Michigan says that the complaint is referred to the appropriate Federal agency, and only if that complaint is not being adequately pursued does the commissioner have that window of investigative authority for her to pursue it. It is a cooperative type of statute.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you know another arrangement where the Federal agency goes first but then the state agency has authority to say Federal agency, you didn't deal with this consumer adequately, so we will take over? I know schemes that work the other way where the state goes first, and then the Federal authority, but do you know another one?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Another one that --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where the primary adjudicator, decision-maker would be the Federal authority, but then the state can override that if it thinks the Federal authority hasn't done an adequate job?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in a sense, in our statute, the commissioner of the state agency is able to investigate if the complaint referred to the comptroller has not been adequately --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's not the question. Justice Ginsburg is trying to find out if you know any other situation where when the Federal agency doesn't do an adequate job, the state agency comes in?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No situations come directly to mind.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Maybe civil rights actions where there's a Federal agency that has some remedial powers and if the Federal agency doesn't act, the citizen is free to bring litigation in state court? I guess that would be --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or environmental regulation where just because the Federal EPA doesn't take a particular action against a polluter, doesn't mean that the state can't take action against the polluter.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't the action an inadequate action? Michigan is saying yeah, the Federal authority can do with respect to this unit just what it would do to a national bank itself, but if we think that is inadequate, that is a question of just one act or the other, but if the -- it is the state judging the adequacy of a particular Federal response.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So if the Federal U.S. Attorney prosecutes, decides to prosecute someone for manslaughter, the state can decide that's not an adequate enough response and prosecute them for murder, right?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.

05-1342 +++$+++ 36599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This still goes to the same thing. Does Michigan do this by grace? If Michigan wanted to, could it just tell the feds to butt out and say, you know, all these years we've been letting you come in first, and we only step in when we think you haven't done a good job, but we've had it. (Laughter.)
05-1342 +++$+++ 36600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Especially after this lawsuit, get out, we're going to regulate our state banks?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor. That would be contrary to the express statutory scheme in Michigan.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I know in Michigan. I'm saying, could Michigan change its statutory scheme to kick the Feds out? Or would that be prevented by this Federal statute we're discussing here? I'm trying to see what you think this Federal statute does. Or what the --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Federal rule provides that the operating -- the State chartered operating subs are to be treated just like the law pertaining to the parent national bank. And there is no authority from Congress given to the OCC that kind of rule. The OCC only has the authority that Congress gives it, either through a preemptive statute or through the dell designation of preemptive authority; and Congress has not given them that kind of power.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me ask the question -- the regulatory question. You do not dispute Michigan does not dispute that the operating -- well, strike that. Michigan does not dispute that national banks can go into business of real estate loans? And Michigan does not dispute that Congress has authorized national banks to operate through subsidiaries for specific purposes like this. My question is can you give me any plausible reason to think that Congress would have contemplated this system of potentially more restrictive State legislation when its national bank in a given instance decides to do -- to exercise its Federal banking power through a subsidiary rather than directly? Can you think of any reason that Congress would have contemplated the scheme that you're, that you're defending?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, first of all, Your Honor, I'm not defending that Michigan has a more restrictive scheme or that Michigan law in any way incapacitates or significantly interferes with the business of banking.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if, if -- if the banks have got, let's say, a subsidiary has to go through two rounds of bank inspection every year instead of one round, it is going to cost them something. Regulation costs the regulated entity something. It is a burden on them. And we also have to assume that there may be instances -- you brought it up -- in, in which the, the -- the State burden is heavier. So with those possibilities in mind, can you think of any reason why Congress in authorizing the exercise of the Federal banking power through a subsidiary would have contemplated Michigan or any State would have this authority? It seems counterintuitive to me. They're saying you can -- - you can -- you banks can exercise the Federal banking power through a subsidiary. It would seem strange to me that Congress would silently say, "and, of course, we acquiesce to a -- a dual system of regulation that would not apply to the bank itself." What reason would Congress have had for assuming that might be the result?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A recognition that the States have a sovereign, compelling and legitimate interest in regulating those corporations that it charters and that do business within its borders. And -- and that that balance should be respected.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So it is state sovereign immunity in effect, is the answer -- State sovereignty is rather the answer?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the - but the key point, and I would like to reserve whatever time I may have.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You better hurry then.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36611 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The key, the key point is that Congress has distinguished clearly and unequivocally between affiliates and national banks; but it has not included affiliates in either Section 481 or 484 of the National Bank Act. National banks are not synonymous or equivalent to the State-chartered operating subsidiaries.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36612 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ THE COURT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Blanchard. Mr. Long?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36614 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. I would like to start with the question that Justice Souter asked because there are some important principles that are really not disputed in this case, and I think they help to focus the issue that is before the Court. There is no dispute, as we understand it, that mortgage lending by national banks is supervised exclusively by the Comptroller of the Currency. And there is also no dispute that national banks' incidental powers under Section 247 include the power to make mortgage loans through a operating subsidiary. And an additional point is that both Federal statutes and Federal regulations state that when national banks make mortgage loans or exercise their banking powers through subsidiaries they do so subject to the same terms and conditions that apply to the exercise of the power by the national --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36615 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Blanchard, may I ask you a question. I just want to understand. Wachovia has branch banks all over the country. Are they generally subsidiaries or are they divisions of the bank?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, a branch of a national bank has a particular status under Section 36 of the National Bank Act.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understand that. I'm asking a factual question.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36618 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It would not be separately incorporated. So --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36619 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They are actually divisions, in effect, of the national bank itself?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36620 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think they are generally referred to as branches but I think its would be more a division. That would be --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36621 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ At least they are not separate corporate subsidiaries.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36622 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That -- that --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36623 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is that, that the Best bank decided to use the subsidiary approach for this business, rather than the more traditional banking approach.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, of course, anything that a bank does through an operating subsidiary it could do through the bank. It can always do it through the bank. But there are many reasons why a bank may choose an operating subsidiary. They can be managerial reasons; it's -- just sometimes works better as matter of business management.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It protects from liability, too.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that is one of the reasons. Although --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- in the district.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I will say, Justice Stevens, I have not been able to find examples of national bank operating subsidiaries that have become insolvent. They are regulated very heavily by the Comptroller and so they don't.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you have a subsidiary that's in the mortgage lending business that presumably competes with other companies in the mortgage lending business that are not associated with national banks, and you're claiming an immunity from the regulation that their competitors are subject to. Is that right?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but again, Mr. Chief Justice, the national banks compete. And its undisputed --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's fine, and they have an express provision in 48 -- 484(a) that says they're, they're exempt from regulation. The question is whether a separate subsidiary that is not a national bank that competes with other mortgage lending companies is immune from the regulation that those other companies --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But again, Mr. Chief Justice, thrifts, S&Ls, State-Chartered banks in all 50 States are permitted to have operating subsidiaries. It's recognized not just for national banks, but really for all types of banking institutions, that are operating subsidiaries are a useful tool of banking. This is not a sort of special privilege that's given --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Breyer's questions were pointing out, to the extent your regulation -- the Federal regulation of your subsidiary conflicts with the State law, that regulation is going to prevail. The question is whether or not you are immune from State regulation across the board --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, and you asked that question. I mean, I think it might be useful to think first about national banks and then about the operating subsidiaries. It is not true that there are no State laws that apply to national banks. This Court's unanimous Barnett Bank decision is the clearest statement of the principle. Any State laws that prevent or significantly impair or impede the exercise of national banking powers are preempted. But many State laws having to do with contracts --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In real world terms, what's involved here? What are examples of some of the things that Michigan does or some other State does that impair or impede the operations to the --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The beginning is, it is a complete separate set of regulation. You have to register or obtain a license. You have to submit to examination by the regulator. Investigation. Enforcement. There are substantive laws; Michigan has some that are not directly at issue in this case --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ One of those laws might be, I mean, let's say they have a law, when you're issuing a mortgage to a consumer, you have to give them a disclosure about how much they're going to end up paying over the life of the loan and all that. And they require that of anybody who issues a mortgage in Michigan. Could that law be applied to your subsidiary?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the question, Mr. Chief Justice, would be is it preempted as to the national bank? The Comptroller of the Currency would say yes. But the issue in this case is if it is preempted as to the national bank, then it is also preempted when the national bank chooses to exercise this power that it has under Section 24 --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't -- isn't your friend correct then? You are really trying to have your cake and eat it, too. You're saying if we did this without a subsidiary, we wouldn't be subject to that. But you want to be able to operate through a subsidiary and yet not be subject to the same rules that apply to other people.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but it, it with respect, it is not really a case of having our cake and eating it, too. We are in the area of powers of national banks. And the Court has recognized for a century that in that area, when national banks have powers, including incidental powers recognized by the Comptroller, they generally preempt any State law that prevents or significantly interferes --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's the question I had. I got somewhat thrown by the Chief Justice's question, because I thought first, when I read the reg, 34.4.ab, that those things that are preempted are those things that obstruct, impair or condition, or in other words limit, the Federal powers of a national bank.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That, that is correct.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I thought we were basically dealing with conflict --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- not fielding.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's -- that's one level --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but the last part of the reg says that what applies, no State law applies to a national bank operating subsidiary if it doesn't apply to the parent bank. And I began to think it fields preemption. Am I right in thinking that it is conflict preemption, not field, because it is conflict in the case of a national bank?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well -- it's, it's a very important point. And our position is there are actually several ways in which you could analyze this case and arrive at the conclusion that the Comptroller's regulations are valid. One is looking simply at statutory language and saying we would, we the Court would reach this result as we did in the Franklin National Bank case even without any regulation. And second of all is to say the regulations are a reasonable interpretation of the statute. A third is to say that the Comptroller has broad rulemaking authority. And as this Court recognized in De La Cuesta and many other cases, an agency exercising its rulemaking authority can preempt State laws even though the statute itself would not --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think, the question is not whether it can preempt State laws but whether the rulemaking authority can, can eliminate a, a basic division of the statute into a national bank and affiliates of the national bank. The statute makes a clear distinction between the two. And the effect of what, of what the agency has to done here is simply to eliminate that distinction, and to say really it doesn't matter.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. It -- I --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you are an affiliate of a national bank, you have the same immunity that the national bank has. That's not what the statute says.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I have a two-part answer to that question, Justice Scalia. One is that Section 484 of the section you're referring to does limit the visitorial authority as to national banks, but it is silent as to operating subsidiaries or any other type of affiliate. States do exercise visitorial authority over some affiliates of national banks. That's established. Operating subsidiaries are a special type of affiliate; 484, which was enacted during the Civil War, a hundred years before operating subsidiaries were authorized, really doesn't address the question of visitorial authority.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, an operating subsidiary is an affiliate, right? What kind of affiliates did they have before they had operating subsidiaries? Did they rent pool halls, or what?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's a type of affiliate --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would have thought that any affiliate of a national bank would, would be engaged in essentially banking business.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, but this really became clear, in answer to your question, in part two of my answer. In 1999 when Congress enacted the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, it directly addressed this question of affiliates of national banks. And this is on page 2A of our appendix. It refers to, it created a new type of affiliate, for the first time, financial subsidiaries which can do anything financial in nature. So they can actually engage in activities that the parent national bank could not. But if you look at the bottom of page 2A of our appendix, this is Section 24A now of the act, it said that financial subsidiaries can also engage in activities that are permitted for national banks to engage in directly, subject to the same terms and conditions that govern the conduct of the activities by a national bank. And then at the bottom of 3A and going over to 4A where they actually define financial subsidiaries, they do so by distinguishing them from the operating subsidiaries which had existed for decades. And at the top of 4A you see that the operating subsidiary again engages only in activities that the national banks may engage in directly and are conducted subject to the same terms and conditions. Then if you'll bear with me a moment longer, on page 12A of our appendix some additional provisions of GLBA -- actually, that's the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, GLBA people call it -- said -- this is on 12A -- that securities activities and insurance activities, activities that have been traditionally subject to State regulation, if they're engaged in by a functionally regulated subsidiary, operating subsidiary or a financial subsidiary, then they may be regulated by relevant State securities authorities or State insurance authorities. So Congress was actually quite specific. I mean, your question is about statutory language. You don't find this in 484, which is, since it's a century old, doesn't really get into this. But in this 1999 statute, it's all about subsidiaries of national banks. Congress was pretty clear if it's securities, if it's insurance, it can be regulated by States. They were specific about that. If it's a banking activity that the bank itself can undertake, it's subject to the same terms and conditions. And so, going back to the Chief Justice's question, you have this question of would it be a preempted State preempted state law if it were applied to the national bank when the national bank is making a mortgage loan. Not every State law is preempted because not every State law conflicts. But if it does --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What authority do you have for the proposition that when then Federal law says subject to the same terms and conditions that they're referring To State regulation as opposed to the same Federal regulation that applies to the national banks?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I mean, we have section 7.4006, which is the 0CC's regulation interpreting that language in the statute and in its own OPSUB regulations, section 5.34. And we also relied simply on the ordinary meaning of "terms and conditions." It means prerequisites, limitations.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was 7.4006 issued pursuant to -- what did you call it, GLBA?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ GLBA?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. Or did it predate that?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ 7.4006 was issued pursuant to 24-7, which is this incidental powers provision, and 24(a), which I've just been walking you through, which is a provision of GLBA. So it is based partly upon GLBA, and it is an interpretation of the same terms and conditions language.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Conflict preemption basically strikes down a State law that stands as an obstacle to the full enforcement of the Federal law.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. Now, with that in mind, suppose that you didn't have either 7.4006 or 34.4(a)(B). Neither existed. But we listened to what the agency said as a Court and they explained how the regulation worked. Would you expect to come to precisely the same result?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I mean, of course --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would you or not?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do have them and we think that makes the case easier, of course.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I know, but would you -- would you expect to come to the same result or not?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. We would say that if you start with 24-7 and the incidental powers of national banks and the undisputed point that one of those incidental powers is for the national bank --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How does it conflict with Federal banking authority for the State to audit the books of the mortgage subsidiary?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it has been established since the beginning of the national banking system that -- and this goes back to the history of the first and second Bank of the United States in McCullough against Maryland -- that the national banking system is protected from possibly unfriendly State legislation.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Take my earlier case about the consumer disclosure. Michigan has a law, I assume, that any mortgage lender has to tell the consumer all this information. Would that conflict with the authority of a national bank?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The Comptroller's view as I understand it is that it would. But again let me emphasize --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ THE COURT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you think any regulation would conflict with the national bank status?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think that may go too far. But I think what Comptroller has done, it has -- has been to look at a series of these State regulations and determine whether in fact they do impair or impede the exercise --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ THE COURT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm trying to get a handle on it. As I understood the case that came, I don't think there's disagreement on either side about how conflict preemption works. But I thought your position was that more is involved here and that the State can't regulate it at all, and you're not getting into a conflict preemption question. It's just if it's a State regulation it can't --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think our position is there are multiple roots that we can win this case. One is based on conflict preemption. Another --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you do take a field preemption position, don't you?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, of course. And another route is simply that the agency has --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, it's truly broader than just conflict preemption.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Literally.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. And the agency has broad rulemaking power. It's exercised it here. There's really no dispute about what the OCC's rules mean. The only question is whether they're valid and then what is --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's your best case for the proposition that an agency and not the Congress defines the extent of field preemption?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That an agency and not the -- certainly the Delaquesta line of cases stand for the proposition that if an agency has preempted State law by regulation, the questions are simply whether the agency has acted within the scope of its delegated authority and whether it is a reasonable accommodation of the conflicting principles and whether there's any reason to think that Congress would have disagreed with it. Are there -- I mean, there are examples. For example, in the world of Federal thrifts OTS has a sort of field preemption as I understand it. It's evolved differently in the world of national banks. That's conflict preemption.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is a functionally regulated subsidiary of a depository institution.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that that again goes to this scheme of GLBA that I was trying to describe. The notion that Congress had is that you're going to regulate by function. So if it's insurance, the State can regulate it whether it's in the subsidiary or in the bank. If it's securities, the SEC and in some circumstances the States can regulate it. But if it's core banking functions like mortgage lending, that's going to be regulated subject to the same terms and conditions that apply when the bank itself conducts those activities.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And is that a functionally regulated subsidiary?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If it's just engaging in banking activities?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is the concept as I understand it. It's going by function and we think that shows actually Congress did --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does Wachovia have any branch banks in Michigan?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Wachovia does not, although -- I mean, an interesting feature of the Michigan law is if they did Michigan's law would not apply, which we think is not consistent with their view that the OCC is an inadequate regulator, because it would be exactly the same whether or not there's a branch.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are there States in which Wachovia has both branch banks and subsidiaries comparable to this?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. LONG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, yes. North Carolina and others. I will add, there was a point at the beginning that this Wachovia Mortgage Company actually was regulated by Michigan for 6 years and there were no problems. During that period it was a subsidiary of a bank holding company, and that's a completely different situation. Those are not regulated at all by the OCC. So of course they were regulated by Michigan. That's the way subsidiaries of bank holding companies are regulated. That's simply a different situation. If there are no further questions, I will --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Long. Mr. Srinivasan.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36701 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin by addressing this question of whether what's going on here is conflict preemption or field preemption. Now, it depends on how one defines those terms. But as we understand it it's conflict preemption, not field preemption, in the following sense. Our position is not that State laws have no application to operating subsidiaries or to national banks for that matter. It's that State laws apply to the same extent to operating subsidiaries as they would to national banks. And as this court has made clear in the Atherton case and in the Barnett Bank case, State laws do apply to national banks and operating subsidiaries in a variety of respects, and State contract law would be an example. But with operating subsidiaries in particular, State laws dealing with corporate governance questions, for example the process of incorporation, dissolution, shareholder voting, and things of that sort, would be controlling and so federal law doesn't control those sorts of aspects.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's field preemption when it comes to regulation. Yes, if the bank is sued the normal rules of contract are going to apply for enforcing a contract. But you're claiming field preemption with respect to regulation, correct?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I guess it depends on the degree to which the regulations apply to the national banks. That's my only point, is that State laws apply to the same extent to the operating subsidiary as to the national bank.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ State laws generally -- State agencies generally don't regulate national banks at all, right?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ State agencies don't generally do that because there's a specific statutory prohibition on that. And Justice Scalia, this goes to your questions about the scope of these provisions at 12 U.S.C. 484(a) and 481. It's true that those provisions say by their terms that visitorial authority resides exclusively with the Comptroller of the Currency with respect to national banks, and there's another provision that deals with affiliates. And so that's the point with visitorial authority. But visitorial authority by its very nature is asserted in service of and enforcement of some underlying substantive requirement, and the underlying substantive requirement at issue here is the requirement that operating subsidiaries register with the State. And so there's a question of conflict preemption that applies both to the national bank and the operating subsidiary of whether that underlying substantive registration requirement could be applied to the national bank or could be applied to the operating subsidiary.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but it is true, is it not, that as long as this mortgage company was a subsidiary of a holding company rather than the bank itself, the State would have done the visiting, the visitorial power, whereas once they changed the Federal Government assumed that responsibility?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't know what you mean by "holding company," Justice Stevens.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, as your co-counsel pointed out, previously this very company was a subsidiary of a holding company that also owned the bank, and at that time it was exclusively regulated by Michigan.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right, because it wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered national bank.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the change in the corporate structure is the sole basis for saying now it's exclusively regulated by the OCC?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is, but it's changing the corporate structure in a fundamentally important way. That's that it's no owned and controlled by a federally chartered national bank.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But this results in field preemption to the extent that the exercise of visitorial power is a regulatory function?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, again it depends on how one defines those terms. And I don't take issue with the fact that as a consequence of the fact that this became a subsidiary --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it is now only the Federal agency that does the visiting, whereas it used to be only the State agency?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the question that led me to is how many additional personnel did OOC employ when it took over this area for 48 States?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't have an empirical answer to that question.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it was certainly quite a few people, I assume.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36719 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But Justice Stevens, in the regulatory materials that attended the promulgation of these rules OCC specifically addressed the question whether it had sufficient resources to exercise oversight authority over operating subsidiaries of national banks. And let's be clear. It's not that the OCC previously had no authority over operating subsidiaries. The question is whether the OCC has exclusive authority over operating subsidiaries. And the OCC determined in the regulatory materials that it had sufficient resources to exercise oversight authority over operating subsidiaries --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36720 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the authority under the old regime was just to make sure that the operation did not affect the financial stability of the parent bank.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36721 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that's because it wasn't an operating subsidiary of a federally chartered national bank, and that changes things in a fundamental way for the following reason: That under the Barnett Bank case the rule of preemption, the special rule of preemption that applies in the context of national banking, is that when you're dealing with enumerated or incidental powers of national banks -- and one incidental power of a national bank is undisputed to be the power to conduct affairs through an operating subsidiary -- that the grants of those powers are normally preemptive of rather than preempted by State law> And so once the operating --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That was an effort of the State to prohibit the national bank from engaging in the activity, correct?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that was. But the Court --
05-1342 +++$+++ 36724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's an obvious case of conflict preemption. Here we have a question of whether or not the State can regular the operating subsidiary to any extent.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the Court's decisions aren't limited to prohibitions of that sort. I'd make two points in that regard. First of all, in one sense this is a prohibition, because the operating subsidiary can't engage in federally authorized activities unless and until it gets the State's permission. So at least there is a prohibition at the outset. But more importantly, the Court's cases aren't limited to situations involving prohibitions of the sort that Your Honor posits, because in the Franklin National Bank case that was a situation in which the national bank had the power to accept savings deposits and the State law that was deemed to be preempted there didn't prohibit the national bank from accepting savings deposits.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What comes next? Can the OCC say, well, the corporate law of this State doesn't really allow subsidiaries to do as much as we think a subsidiary of a national bank ought to be able to do, so we're going to attribute additional corporate powers to this subsidiary? Can it do that?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, not if you're talking about corporate powers, because those are governed by State law. What it could do, though, is regulate the subsidiary's conduct of the business of banking, because, after all, an operating subsidiary has one purpose and one purpose only, and that's to carry out functions that the national bank itself could perform.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What troubles me, and maybe you can answer to it more specifically than you have, is that the core function of a banking regulatory agency is the visitation power, and the Banking Act makes it very clear that there is visitation power to national banks and makes it very clear that there is not for subsidiaries. And here is a regulation which under the guise, it seems to me, of defining the powers of the national bank simply eliminates that distinction. And it seems to me that perhaps goes beyond what an agency regulation is allowed to do.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With respect, Justice Scalia, I don't think the statutes say that at all. There is a statute, 484(a), that says that the OCC's visitorial authority is exclusive with respect to national banks. But there is no statute that says that the OCC's visitorial authority is not exclusive with respect to subsidiaries. There's another statute that deals with affiliates. Now one point is that affiliates are not limited to subsidiaries, but they could include for example, I guess brother and sister corporations for lack of a better term, that are controlled by a common parent. But another point is that at the time these statutes were enacted, Congress simply didn't have within its field of vision the notion that a national bank would have the power to exercise its functions through a subsidiary corporation.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36730 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why should we assume that they wanted to preempt state laws to that extent.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36731 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because what Congress was trying to do is to make sure that the OCC had exclusive visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of national bank function. It's just at the time that these statutes were enacted, the only play that national bank functions were being conducted was by a national bank itself. Now later on, when the laws of all 50 states, the OTS, the Federal Reserve with respect to state member banks, and the comptroller gives banks the authority to conduct national -- to conduct bank functions through its subsidiaries, then this issue arises about who exercises visitorial authority with respect to the conduct of those functions for a subsidiary. And it stands to reason that if the baseline rule is that with respect to the conduct of national bank functions through a national bank itself, the OCC visitorial authority is exclusive, then when a national bank exercises its Federal entitlement to conduct those very same functions through an operating subsidiary, the OCC's visitorial authority, likewise, would be exclusive. That seems to me to be an entirely reasonable regulatory determination by the comptroller, and there's nothing in those statutory provisions that speaks directly to that issue and that in any way precludes the comptroller from reaching that determination.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36732 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Practically, is there any difference between the way they operated when they were just a corporation as before, and now a parent and sub?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36733 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there could be. I don't know about this particular case but there absolutely could be, Justice Ginsburg, because when they become subsidiaries they are controlled by the national bank and not by some other entity. And the reason that a national bank would choose to engage in this sort of structure rather than folding the enterprise into the bank itself are many fold. And in part it's for efficiency purposes because you can have focused management, especially when you're dealing with the sort of specialized things that operating subsidiaries typically do. But there's also other reasons. For example, there's a modularity component to this in the sense that the best specialized functions such as mortgage lending, very often a national bank will purchase an entity that conducts that activity, and may be interested in selling the entity later, and it's much more straightforward to do that if those functions are maintained in a separate subsidiary corporation.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there any aspect of state law, including liability limitation, that they want to take advantage of by establishing a subsidiary chartered under state law, Michigan or another state, and yet they're claiming immunity from all other state regulations?
05-1342 +++$+++ 36735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, with respect to liability limitation in particular, Mr. Chief Justice, I should clarify that veil piercing principles and things of that sort would be governed by state law with respect to the operating subsidiary. So if the question is whether the corporate veil is pierced, state law would dictate an answer to that question. But, may I just finish one thought? States won't have an incentive to liberally construe veil piercing principles with respect to national banks precisely because state member banks in all 50 states also have operating subsidiaries through which they charter banks to conduct banking functions. Thank you.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Blanchard, you have a minute remaining.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36738 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. BLANCHARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Two key points. First, Section 484 and 481 have been amended subsequent to the time operating subsidiaries came into play. Congress knew of operating subsidiaries when it amended 484 twice in the 1980s, and 481 was amended four times. Yet, never did Congress insert the word "affiliates" into the exclusive power of the OCC in 488. Secondly, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley act is being greatly distorted. The same terms and conditions language that my opponent referred to was meant to return op subs only to the authority that the parent bank could engage in. It wasn't preemptive or meant to preempt the states. The comptroller had issued a ruling, 34.F, (f), and they had allowed operating subsidiaries to do things differently from the parent bank.
05-1342 +++$+++ 36739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Blanchard. The case is submitted.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36743 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in United Haulers Association versus Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority. Mr. Tager.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36745 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The barriers to interstate commerce imposed by the flow control ordinances in this case are even more severe than those resulting from the ordinance this Court struck down in Carbone. As in Carbone, no local waste can leave the counties for processing. In addition, now that Respondent's landfill is up and running no local waste can leave the counties for disposal either. The issue here is whether Carbone is inapplicable to this outright embargo merely because Respondent's own the facilities to which the haulers are required to bring the waste. The answer is no, and the reason is that the concerns underlying the Commerce Clause are implicated whether interstate commerce was being obstructed for the benefit of a public enterprise or a private one. The whole point of the Commerce Clause was to promote the national economy and to put an end to parochial barriers to interstate trade. This Court has consistently held that embargoes, local processing requirements, and other barriers to interstate commerce violate the Commerce Clause because such laws inevitably prompt resentment, retaliation, and ultimately --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36746 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I guess in many thousands of municipalities throughout the United States it's fairly common to have a locally owned electricity distribution company, or an electrically -- or a gas distribution company. And I thought it was fairly common for a municipally owned pipeline, gas pipeline, or electricity distribution to say, if you live in our town you've got to buy from us; you've got to buy from the local community. And I guess that's been going on for about 110 years. And yet I've never seen anybody think or write or anything that that violated the Commerce Clause. But of course, there could be somebody in another State who'd like to sell electricity to the people in our town. They can't do it because the town says, we own the company and you got to buy from us. Now, if we agree with you are we saying that all those gas companies, distribution companies, et cetera, are behaving unconstitutionally?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36747 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The first point of clarification on that is the question -- the question is does strict scrutiny apply.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36748 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I'm not interested in tests. I'm interested in just the outcome. I just raise the question.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36749 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. I am not, I am not sure that it's correct that in all of those municipalities you hypothesize that they are actually pairing their provision of local --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I used to teach the subject and I can't say you're wrong. But I knew that it was a fairly common thing to have a certification that gave you a -- as a company, it would give them a local area in which they had an exclusive monopoly. And that was common and it was called a service area, and in the local town, the service area, I never even heard of a company trying to come in and sell from abroad, because I thought that this certificate gave them an exclusive right to provide the local electricity service or the natural gas service. I mean, it's a fairly obvious thing. And I might be wrong and I mention that my memory -- I've never focused directly on it. Just everybody I read and everything I read, I assumed the constitutionality of this. But of course, memory is fallible, including mine. Therefore, I raise the question.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if the utility is -- if the utility is privately owned --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. I'm not talking about that because I guess that would be trying to attack Carbone. Far be it from me. But I know at least there are these things called municipal gas utilities and municipal electricity companies; and during the New Deal that was thought to be quite a good thing, and that's years ago. In all that time when people were attacking New Deal agencies, I've never seen an attack based on this ground.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think that the same logic would apply as in --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yeah, I think it would. The same logic would apply.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36755 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it would apply to all of the cases this Court has ever held. In every single case involving an embargo or a local processing requirement or a local needs requirement, if you just substitute "in public ownership" you'd have the exact same case --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36756 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the fact is there is a difference between public ownership and giving an exclusive franchise to a public company. And the public ownership means that the people of the State have decided to have their own little nationalized industry, which again people don't like, many. But I never knew there was anything in the Constitution that forbid it.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think that the whole point of the Commerce Clause was to stop these kind of --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Nationalized industries?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, to stop the idea that everything can be localized.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but you don't even have to get into the theory. What happens in a lot of municipalities of course is that they decide, well, we're going to run the waste treatment facility and we're going to tax the people in the municipality to support it and the service is going to be free. Now, is that a violation of the Commerce Clause?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If they're only providing it for free and not barring you --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- from engaging in interstate commerce, in the event, for example, that you found there to be some additional benefit from engaging in an interstate transaction, I think we would have -- the Commerce Clause would be implicated. But as a practical matter, they would be able to accomplish much the same thing because most people would take the free service.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't understand. You know, as far as the impact on out of State competitors are concerned, it's exactly the same. The State or the municipality runs its own waste disposal facility. There is no charge for dumping the waste there. The cost of it is entirely covered by taxes. Okay. Now, the people you're representing, out of state people who would provide dumping grounds for this waste, they would charge 9 dollars a ton or whatever they would charge. It would be more than what the municipality is charging. Now, why isn't that a restraint on interstate commerce, discrimination against interstate commerce?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's market participation if all they're doing is public collection and bringing it --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry. You have to dump your waste in the municipal garbage dump.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you parrot the Flow Control ordinance I think it's exactly the same.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, so that's fair. Even if they support it entirely by taxes?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that they're not competing in the marketplace in any way, they're not getting any money from the people who are dumping garbage. They get money from the whole tax base.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The impact on the interstate market is the same, and I think that --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, it is indeed.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the Court's Commerce Clause --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I didn't think you'd be willing to go that far, but you'd say that that violates the Commerce Clause.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I don't think I -- let me be clear. We don't need to win that case in order to win this case, because in this case --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'm not so sure.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ This case is almost on all fours with Carbone. All you've done is transfer the ownership. As you know, in Carbone that facility was destined to be owned within less than 2 years from the time the Court issued its opinion.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But in the majority opinion, as opposed to the dissent, at least as I read it, on almost every page it uses words like "local operator," "local enterprise," "local proprietor," "local business," doesn't speak, as the dissent did, about a municipal facility. It seems great care was taken in the majority to not characterize that transfer pledge as a municipal facility.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, two responses to that, Justice Ginsburg. First, there were other references where the opinion said "the town's facility." Indeed, the Flow Control witness himself referred to it as the town's facility. And the other response is, to call someone a proprietor doesn't mean that they're private. In this case, they're charging $81 -- or $86 a ton. Every ton that comes in, they make more money.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry. At least as I read the Carbone opinion, it didn't deal with the public-private distinction. It seemed to assume it was a private entrepreneur. And it didn't take a position one way or another whether there would be a distinction.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't think the Court affirmatively decided the issue. I think the distinction didn't matter to the majority. I think the majority is focusing on the consequences of putting up barriers to interstate commerce, of putting up embargoes and local processing requirements. And you could take almost any one of the Court's cases and just substitute in public ownership. Take, for example --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But not -- you know, you have a whole string of commercial products, but you have recognized, too, that garbage disposal has for long been considered a municipal responsibility, a municipal function. And you also say that the total, the -- what is it -- cradle to grave, if the county took over all of the garbage disposal business, the hauling from the garbage generator to the plant, and then there wouldn't be any commerce problem, right? But if it does something less, there is?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36783 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there were two questions embedded there. Let me see if I can take them in order. The idea that it is a traditional local function, I don't think can support any kind of meaningful test in this case. The Court has rejected that very - that very standard in Garcia and the Tenth Amendment cases, and prior to that in the intergovernmental tax immunity cases, and the reason it did so is it found that it was unworkable to try to determine what is a traditional government function in any particular case. The Court found that it was in a total line-drawing morass. And so it said we're throwing that out.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36784 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there is still at least the obvious distinction, that one of the main purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause is to prevent protectionism. Protectionism is when a state favors its own producers. And you could see, indeed a big argument in Carbone was, you aren't favoring your own producer; well, we are at least favoring one. But now where the municipality is running it itself, no one is favored. So I don't think it was an object of the Commerce Clause to prevent a State from favoring its own government.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know whether the framers considered it but I do know --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's about --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- protectionism wasn't the only thing that they were concerned about.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, is there something here that is not protection? Because Carbone was still perhaps viewing it most favorably, an extreme case of protection, only one individual was protected.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. First of all, what was being protected was this plan. The town had to fund its transfer station, a transfer station that it was going to take possession of less than two years after this Court decided the case. So the protectionism that was going on there was really protection of their investment in their scheme.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it was also protectionism -- I mean, I didn't agree with this at the time, but I mean there, it -- you have to admit that there was protectionism of the one licensee, the person who constructed the plant and was going to sell it to the town for a dollar. That, so far as we know, that person or that company was in it for the money. And so for the period of the five years prior to the transfer to the town for the dollar, that particular entity was being protected so it could make money, and therefore, make it worthwhile for that company to sell its, its real estate to the town for a dollar. Surely that entity was being protected handsomely.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it would be equally protected, Your Honor, if the government owned the facility but said you keep all the tipping fees until it's paid off and take a nice profit on top, too. This distinction --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's -- that's a third case but that's not the question we have here, is it?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the case you have here is are you going to adopt a new formalistic particular distinction between public and private ownership, when in the past this Court has concluded that a lot of these other distinctions were unworkable.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, so, you say formalistic as if it's a bad thing. But the, the distinction, say in the First Amendment, if the private contractor the day before the municipality bought the facility for a dollar had fired an employee because of his or her political views, you wouldn't argue that that is state action just because the next day it was going to be controlled by the public entity. And yet the next day, that type of action would be subject to First Amendment scrutiny. It may be a formalistic distinction but in many areas of the law it makes all the difference.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I just think you are going to be walking into so many line-drawing problems because if that example is one, are you going to require 100 percent public ownership, or a majority interest, 50-50? Once you go down this road, I think it is just opening up a huge can of worms when the focus ought to be what is the impact on interstate commerce? What we have here now that the landfill is up and running is an absolute embargo. No waste generated in this town, in these counties, excuse me, can leave the State, period, end of story. It is no different, in effect, it is no less likely to breed resentment and retaliation than --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is kind of formalistic on the other side because you, I thought you agreed that if the municipality did it through tax revenues and there was no formal flow restriction and yet it only made sense to dump your waste at the free facility, you seem to suggest that would be okay.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36797 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'm glad you reminded me of that point. I meant to make it earlier. In West Lynn Creamery this Court said that these kind of things make a difference. There are certain ways you do things and certain ways you can't do things. If you place an embargo, that's traditionally been regarded as subject to strict scrutiny. If you try to do the same thing by making it free and providing public -- public -- public collection, that's okay. And -- and what the Court cases say is do it the right way and we'll worry about the consequences later.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36798 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Here, I take it the reason they want to do this is because they wanted their municipal facility to charge a higher price for the non-recyclable rubbish and that will encourage people to segregate the rubbish and thereby have more cyclable -- recyclable rubbish, and therefore overall pay less. And that's why they want to do it, and of course that's not going to work. If somebody comes in from out of State and charges a lower price for all of the non-recyclable rubbish or you know, for all rubbish, it just won't work. It is rather like electricity, interestingly enough, where municipalities would do the same thing. They want discriminatory rates in order to push out the possibility of poorer people getting electricity. This they want to do the same thing but they want to do it for rubbish, for, to encourage recycling.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36799 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Several answers to that, Justice Breyer. One, the same argument was made in Carbone. It doesn't matter who owns the facility. Two, this is an argument about why they might survive strict scrutiny, it's not a -- I know you don't like hearing about that -- but the question here is do we apply strict scrutiny or not. And that goes to the strength of their interest. And then of course the question turns on, can it be met in nondiscriminatory ways? The answer is "very well." Since Carbone was decided, the municipalities have been living with no flow control, virtually every one in the country, yet recycling has gone up in the, in that intervening period. Indeed the best way to accomplish recycling is to charge volume-based fees to, to the -- between the haulers and the, and the generators. That's not what is going on here. They're just charging it at the disposal point. So there are plenty of communities all -- excuse me -- plenty of communities all over the country that are charging what's known as a batch fee where you pay for each -- you pay -- you get a label, like you put on a bag; you can't dispose of the bag without the label, the label costs a certain amount of money. None of these people have flow -- none of these communities have flow control but there's a direct straightforward way. They can also impose regulations directly on the generators and directly on the haulers to make sure they're doing these things. So it is hardly a reason for creating a brand-new public-private distinction.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36800 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It sounds to me as though, if we accept your argument that, going back to Justice Breyer's first question, every municipal utility in the United States is going to fall.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36801 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- I'm not an expert on -- on that industry.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36802 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but you know, you know that there are plenty of, of communities that don't have municipal utilities and seem to get natural gas. They seem to get electricity. The lights go on. And therefore by parity of reasoning to what we have just heard, there just wouldn't be the justification for, let's say, embargoing the importation of electricity and gas by private entities from outside. So that if you win on this argument, no more municipal lifelines.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36803 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I didn't hear the last part.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36804 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No more municipal pipelines.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36805 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think they can have the plant. They just -- assuming that is --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36806 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they'd like to run them as --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36807 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They'd like to have a monopoly, and --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- an exclusive monopoly, and in that sense they won't, they won't be around anymore because the Commerce Clause will, will declare them unconstitutional.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36809 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but that's excluding that -- as I understand it --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36810 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You would say that they can do it so long as they charge less than out of State people --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36811 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36812 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- and therefore people buy their services because they're cheaper. So long as they don't prohibit the importation, if they run the municipal facility on tax revenues, and therefore charge very little for the electricity or whatever they're providing, that's perfectly okay for you. Right?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36813 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36814 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So long as they don't prohibit anybody from out of State.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then where does your argument about formalism go? Isn't it a formalistic distinction whether the utility does its financing through or its collection through taxes, or through a user fee? You said, you said distinctions on -- I thought you said distinctions like that were purely formalistic --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- for purposes of the Commerce Clause, and therefore the distinction I suppose wouldn't count.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think what I was talking about, the public-private distinction, it is different in kind from saying there are certain kinds of conduct, some kinds of Government conduct that are permissible like a subsidy, for example, take your South-Central Timber versus Wunnicke case. The Court said in that opinion you can't impose contractually on the people who buy the timber the obligation to process it in the State; but what you can do is you can subsidize it, so they can't want to do it. So this is something that has --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36820 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's some, then I guess you are saying some formalistic distinctions, some distinctions that don't make any difference economically but are formalistically different are okay.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36821 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'm not sure that one is completely formalistic. The Court said there, that gives people a choice. They can still take it out of the State if they want to, and they may have good reason to. Going back to the trash argument, the trash example, you could provide it for free; but a consumer might say, you know what, I'd like to have more days of pickup than you're providing me. Or I think their trucks of this private company are a lot nicer; I'd rather have a van stopping in front of my house than your beaten up municipal truck. So a case like Wunnicke establishes that that's the way it works. That it's okay to have alternatives. What you can't have is forcing people to do this through regulation.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- is there a distinction between the question Justice Breyer put to you, the hypothetical of a municipal electricity company, and this case? In this case you have private haulers, you have private waste dumps at the end, you just have a public, a publicly owned and mandated processing center in the middle. It would be as if in the electric case you have private electric companies that generate the power, private electric companies that distribute the power, but they all have to go through a Government-owned transformer at the key. It seems that's the case you have here.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. That's why --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you don't make that, that's not the argument you make.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I would --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36826 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At least that's not the way you answered Justice Breyer.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I like your answer better, Your Honor. (Laughter.)
05-1345 +++$+++ 36828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what, what I was trying to get back to was --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Like it --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, but then, but then Justice Breyer is going to say well, you --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He'd changed the hypo.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that you, that you can bar it altogether but you can't regulate it just a little bit --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You can --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- actually is greater than the sum of it.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I actually point out that California, I think, wants to own the grid and privatize the rest of it. And there are -- I mean, it -- Justice Kennedy is totally right. There are all kinds of combinations and permutations. There, there could be distributors who are in fact regulated private companies and local distributors who are owned by the city, and I guess there, there is one generator, at least, company that's owned by the -- that's a -- TV -- with TVA. They, they make their own. So there are all kinds of permutations and combinations. And I think we're getting at, when we take that aspect of the permutation and combination and say that aspect of it which is owned by a Government says: "Our way or the highway." You know, that's what they say. "Buy from us." Period. And if you're in a certain region, I've always thought they could do that. And I have to admit I never really looked it up; I've just never came across a case that says to the contrary.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I, I haven't seen a case either way. It's my, my way of seeing this case law is that there's -- that the rule is simple: if you are doing something to interfere with the free flow of interstate commerce, you're subject to strict scrutiny. And maybe in that situation, maybe it survives strict scrutiny. I don't know that they would in this day and age, when getting, getting gas or other kinds of power to a commercial establishment, for example, is not very difficult and would not necessarily tear up the infrastructure, or whatever. I think they might --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What I guess we really don't know is whether Justice Breyer's parade of horribles are cases in which the municipality was able to provide the service more cheaply if it subsidized it, in which case there's no burden on commerce, or were they accompanied by prohibitions against competition, as Justice Scalia pointed out. I don't know.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it's hypothetical.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's a quite different assumption.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think his hypothetical assumed a ban. But I certainly agree with you, Justice Stevens, that if they do it simply by competing, then that's perfectly acceptable.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what is your authority for the proposition that we use strict scrutiny?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I draw it from the entire line of cases, from the local processing cases, the embargo cases, the local --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36843 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can you give me one case of it being strict scrutiny?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36844 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ For?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36845 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, I just didn't realize that that phrase entered into our Commerce Clause jurisprudence. Correct me if I'm wrong.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36846 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I was using it as a synonym for the "virtually per se unconstitutional" rule.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36847 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is to say, if it discriminates?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36848 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If it discriminates, or some of the earlier cases didn't use the term --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36849 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But certainly on burden cases we don't require that.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36850 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, not the burden that we talk about in the price context. But in the earlier cases they referred, cases like Minnesota versus Barber and some of the other, earlier cases, refer to it as being burdens on commerce, but clearly what they meant was there are certain kinds of regulations, and I think it's easier to just categorize them, embargoes, local needs requirements, local processing requirements, things likes that, which basically so obstruct interstate commerce as to require the virtual per se rule. Indeed, Pike itself has that very statement. That's sort of the classic case in which you invoke that high level of scrutiny. If the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36851 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cahill.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36853 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: No decision of this Court has held that public service is comparable to private enterprise for purposes of dormant Commerce Clause analysis. Here the only entity that benefits from these laws is the government itself.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36854 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All the local processing cases, would they have come other differently if those facilities -- the milk processing plant, the shrimp processing plant, and so forth -- had been publicly owned?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36855 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think, Your Honor, they would be different. In each of those cases the laws in question operated to protect a private entity or group of entities. In Dean Mills, for instance, it was a group of private milk pasteurizers within a five-mile radius of the town -- the city of Madison. In none of those cases was the government itself engaged in providing the service to the public.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36856 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it might be a good revenue device for the government to say, yeah, let's have our own pasteurizing plant, we'll make it a criminal offense for anybody to use a facility other than ours and we'll charge triple the price.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36857 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36858 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not a burden on interstate commerce?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36859 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That might be. In our case that is not the case here. What we use is a user fee. We have a limit. There's a limit to a user fee. We can --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36860 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose the user fee were ten times what it is?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36861 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We can only charge something that's reasonably related to the cost of what, of the service that we provide.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36862 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why is that?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36863 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In Evansville Airport, Your Honor, this Court held that -- versus Delta Airlines -- that a user fee is constitutionally limited; there has to be a relationship between the cost of a service and the amount that's charged.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36864 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So don't call it a user fee. Call it something else.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36865 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, if we --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36866 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Call it a tax ripoff. (Laughter.)
05-1345 +++$+++ 36867 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then you can charge whatever you want, so long as you don't call it a user fee, right?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36868 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In New York, Your Honor, you either have to call it a user fee or a tax or something else.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36869 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Call it a cable TV franchise fee. I mean, isn't that the way municipalities used to make a lot of money? They charged outrageous amounts to give the cable franchise and then grant a monopoly in exchange.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36870 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't know what cable franchises base their, base their amounts on. I do know that in our case the cost to tip a ton of waste is directly related to the value of the services that we provide to the public.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36871 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To get back to the public-private distinction, what is the answer to Mr. Tager's point that that's difficult to -- what if you have a 50 percent publicly owned, 50 percent privately owned company? Is that covered by the Commerce Clause cases or not?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36872 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I think that the -- they would not be -- it would not be unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause cases. I think that the distinction is that when government is actually in the transaction, when it's taking the risks, when it's spending public money, when it's providing a service directly to the people, it's a public, it's a public service.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36873 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But at the same -- exactly that -- that avoids the problem. At exactly the same time, it's protecting the private 50 percent interest. Why isn't the better answer that in fact that would be subject to Commerce Clause analysis and that would fall, that if the government wants to do this the government's going to do it the way the government's doing it in your case, it's going to be a 100 percent government. If it doesn't, it's protectionism.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36874 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I agree with you. We don't have 50 percent ownership. We don't have any private ownership anywhere. There are, however, government agencies in other contexts where there is a private partner. That's a case that isn't here today. But the question was what if there was, and I don't think the answer is automatic one way or the other.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36875 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You know, there's a general agreement throughout the world nowadays that sovereign immunity, which usually applies to governments, doesn't apply when the government is engaged in a commercial activity. Now, why shouldn't something similar apply to government regulation which ends up discriminating against out of State businesses, when the government is engaging in a commercial activity it is subject to the restrictions of the Commerce Clause? Why isn't that a reasonable rule?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36876 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it is a reasonable rule. But I don't think that we're engaging in commercial activity in this particular case. If we were to offer our services to citizens to whom we do not have a governmental responsibility, then I think we're entering into the realm of competition with the private sector.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36877 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I suppose any private entity can choose its market.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36878 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Pardon me, Your Honor?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36879 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I suppose any private entity can choose its market. You're a market participant. You're saying, we're going to serve this class of consumers. That's your privilege. But what you do is you have a market participation which is sanctioned by the criminal law. You've built this trash utopia where everybody sends wonderful trash and you enforce use of that by the criminal law. So you're engaging as a market participant, but you're taking an extra advantage by using the criminal law to enforce, to enforce its use.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36880 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't -- I agree with you that we're providing a service here, and we do use the law to require that haulers and generators participate in the service that we -- in the system that we've created. We need to have -- to achieve the goals that we're trying to achieve. We've asked our public to separate their wastes and we've asked our haulers to collect it in a way that's consistent with the programs that we've established.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36881 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You could do that by requiring all trash pickup to segregate recyclable and non-recyclable, and if it's going to cost each householder just as much trouble then there could be competition and you would have achieved your goal. No?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36882 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. There is no competition between our program and -- that's offered by the private sector. What we do is different than what the private sector offers and there's no place else for it to go. The haulers are required today to comply with the program and to coordinate their activities with the separation done by the residents and the facilities that the authority has putting to. We do things -- we have three different, three basic differences between what we do and what the private sector would do. The first one is to step in and take some of the risk for proper disposal. When the haulers make the decision about where the garbage goes, there's a liability that attaches to the waste. If it goes to the wrong place it's going to follow, follow back both to the hauler and to the person who generated it. We have had some bad experiences with people making bad decisions about where waste goes in the 1980s and the public asked us to set something up so that they could trust who was making the disposal decisions. So as a government we've stepped into that problem. We've stepped into the shoes of the generator, and we're trying to set up a place --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36883 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You could do that by law. You could do that by law. You could specify that only certain waste facilities can be used.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36884 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think not, Your Honor.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36885 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You don't have to run the business in order to assure that, do you?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36886 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think we do.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36887 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36888 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because we don't have the power as a local government in New York to talk to landfills in Ohio or Pennsylvania about how they should run their facilities. The only way that we can be sure that it goes to the right place, that's engineered the right way and built the right way and run the right way is to offer to do it ourselves. And that's what we've --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36889 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But none of that -- in answer to my earlier question, I thought you said none of that really matters, right? The only thing that matters is that this is a publicly owned facility. You could be selling hamburgers or renting videos and it would come out the same way.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36890 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think why public ownership matters is that it's not discriminatory. I think the strict scrutiny test should not apply when government owns --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36891 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So your answer is yes?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36892 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36893 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't matter? Hamburgers are just as good?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36894 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, hamburgers, Your Honor, if the government was going to be the sole purveyor of hamburgers in a community, I think they'd have to have a very, very good reason. If they had such a good reason, then yes, government could do that.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36895 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's just a question of New York law, isn't it?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36896 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36897 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't know, I don't know what municipalities can do in New York. You say they've got to have a good reason. I assume you're referring to New York law for that purpose.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36898 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I am not, Your Honor. I have no idea --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36899 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What are you referring to, then?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36900 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The concept, the concept that government might be, might find it necessary to get into the hamburger business. I can't --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36901 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then essentially it's just a political check on it. When you say there's got to be a good reason, politically people would get mad if you didn't have a good reason; is that basically it?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36902 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's one reason. It would also --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36903 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there's no Commerce Clause reason?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36904 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think there's no Commerce Clause reason.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36905 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36906 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think there's no Commerce Clause reason.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36907 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Cahill, you started to tell us three reasons why it was important that you regulate. You gave us one. Mention the other two.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36908 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The other two are, Your Honor, that we are fulfilling national objectives in trying to establish the system that reduces the amount of waste that we generate and recycles as much as possible. That's not necessarily something that the private sector would do. A landfill is not built to discourage the amount of waste that comes through it. Our system is designed to try to change the habits of our citizens and increase recycling --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36909 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but it's basic Commerce Clause analysis that a State has no interest in what happens to the product out of State. Baldwin versus Seelig.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36910 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I think --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36911 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You can't say we want -- we're enacting this law to affect what happens in other States. That's just contrary to the Commerce Clause.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36912 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We are not attempting to regulate what goes on in other States. We are attempting --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36913 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I thought that was just the answer you gave to Justice Stevens on your point two.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36914 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We are attempting to protect our own citizens by reducing the liabilities that they may incur if that waste is shipped anywhere outside of the counties. We hope to give them a better solution for disposal than they would get from the marketplace. To the extent that liability crosses state lines, we are trying to protect our citizens from that liability --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36915 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Whether they want the protection or not?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36916 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36917 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And whether a private individual can come and offer them the same protection for less money or not?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36918 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, that's true.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36919 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We're the government and we're here to help you?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36920 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36921 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But isn't that almost a fourth point? I realize you didn't get the third point out yet. But isn't -- I remember your brief and isn't there sort of a fourth point? And that is, I will assume that the government does have some basic health and safety objectives and the objective to protect its citizens here.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36922 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36923 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the government tries to pursue these policies solely by private inducement, trash haulers may say, we don't want to deal on those terms, we can haul somewhere else, in another county, another State, what-not. By taking on the job itself, the government in effect is guaranteeing that to the extent it can protect its citizens, induce respect for environmental policy, and so on, it will do so without any cessation of service? There's kind of an assurance of service plus the objectives that the government gets by running the plant itself. And isn't that sort of the nub of all of your points?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36924 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, that's true. That is the essence of government. We are there and we are going to have to stay there. Whether -- where a private entity might decide to go out of business tomorrow, government is going to be there to continue to do what we set out to do. But this leads me also to my third point, which is that we're attempting to implement a comprehensive solid waste plan. With the passage of Federal legislation on these environmental matters touching on waste in the 1970s, with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and With the Comprehensive Environmental Response and Liability Act, there was a new message sent to the country, which to generators meant, you better think about what you're doing with this stuff. You better make a -- you better watch where it goes and you better be careful because liability could attach to you. And RCRA told government, States and localities, it was their responsibility to come up with plans to find new ways to manage solid wastes. That's what we've done. Any time a government comes together to put a plan together to dispose of solid wastes, whether like ours it uses several different technologies to try to address different parts of the waste stream, you have to have the cooperation of the people who collect the waste. If the people who collect the waste could drive its away to anywhere they please, the plan is no plan; the plan is just a suggestion. The haulers --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36925 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Who mandated this plan? The State of New York?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36926 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The State of New York.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36927 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the State of New York can't mandate what happens to interstate commerce.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36928 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor, it cannot.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36929 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you say the Congress of the United States has authorized discrimination against interstate commerce, then of course it can do that. That has happened.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36930 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is not our position, Your Honor. We're not saying that RCRA or any of these statutes authorize discrimination against interstate commerce. What the Federal statutes did do, however, was recognize that the states do have the sovereign power to act, and they expected the states to act in this way.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36931 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let's take one of these classic discrimination cases involving milk. I think what you're telling us is that if Wisconsin adopted a law requiring all milk to be pasteurized at a facility owned and operated by the State of Wisconsin, that would be perfectly okay.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36932 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That would not discriminate against interstate commerce.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36933 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right. And it would really advantage Wisconsin dairy farmers, wouldn't it, and really disadvantage out of Wisconsin dairy farmers, and you think that the Commerce Clause doesn't speak to that.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36934 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I do think the Commerce Clause speaks to it, Your Honor, but I just -- our position is it just doesn't require strict scrutiny. I think the Pike test is a very good test to get to the bottom of why Wisconsin would want to do such a thing, and it would also be a good test to show just what the adverse impact on interstate commerce was, and what precisely the benefits of, to Wisconsin there might be. I think the Pike test --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36935 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So then, the Commerce Clause would become the vehicle by which we would develop federal law about what's appropriate for municipal governments to do and what's not appropriate? We could decide it may be appropriate to run waste facilities but not to run milk pasteurization. I don't know how we would do that.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36936 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't know how you would do that either, Your Honor, but you would be led into that by accepting the petitioner's argument that public services and private sector services are comparable under the Commerce Clause. To go back to your example, earlier, Justice Scalia --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36937 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if we accepted that argument, we would treat the public services just like we treat, you know, the legislation favoring private companies. You're the one that's arguing for special treatment based on public ownership.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36938 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think we are not, Your Honor. I think public ownership and public services are unique and they're different, and they should be subject to Commerce Clause scrutiny, but not --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36939 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the whole point is these are not unique. The whole point is there are private companies that provide these kinds of services. Maybe water, maybe electricity, maybe those are or are not unique. But you can't say that this is a unique service being provided by government.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36940 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the approach that Oneida-Herkimer has taken is in fact unique. It is tailored to our local situation. It's not something that the marketplace would provide if the government was not there. And if the Petitioner's idea that any government service could be challenged under the dormant Commerce Clause simply because there's a private entity out there that says they could do the same thing were accepted, the definition of discrimination would be changed from differential treatment of economic interests to differential treatment of government or economic interests. And whether we use the taxing power or police power to support a public enterprise, it would be subject to challenge.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36941 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the challenge here isn't gauging this business, the question is whether you can require everybody in the area to go through the one facility and pay a tipping fee.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36942 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CAHILL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I would like to close, I think, because I'm running out of time, with just the admonition or requirement that we are, in providing a public service, still subject to the Constitution and we must deal with the part private sector fairly. But if we do deal with the private sector fairly and we don't favor anyone in state or anyone out of state, we should be judged under the balancing test of Pike, so that the Court, if the court below found the benefits of our system substantially outweigh any incidental burdens that are placed on it by commerce, placed on commerce by the system. Thank you.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36943 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Cahill. Ms. Halligan.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36945 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: As you suggested, Justice Breyer, the theory that petitioners would have the Court adopt here is in fact a novel one. What they are suggesting is that there is discrimination sufficient to trigger near fatal scrutiny every time the government takes over, to the exclusion of all private actors both in state and out of state, a government service, that that is sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny. That is completely inconsistent with the way that this Court has defined what constitutes discrimination for purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause. The Court has said, and it has stressed repeatedly in its precedent, that discrimination is the differential treatment of in state and out of State economic interests, not government interests, in a way that benefits the former and burdens the latter. That's from Oregon Waste System.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36946 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me ask you a sort of simple question. Is there an interstate impact on, of a municipal rule whether it is milk, or garbage, or what, that says all of this product must be processed within this city before it can go out of State?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36947 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There may well be an interstate impact.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36948 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Doesn't that have a burden on interstate commerce?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36949 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It may well, and that is something that is appropriately judged under the Pike standard.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36950 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't that exactly what we have here?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36951 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that you do have that here, and you should judge it under the Pike valency test, not under the near fatal scrutiny that's, that's --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36952 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But Pike doesn't apply to discrimination. Pike applies to burdens.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36953 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. And where you have --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36954 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It seems you are conflating the two.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36955 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Respectfully, I disagree, Your Honor. Where you have the government taking over a service entirely, that doesn't constitute discrimination because there is no local private interest that is advantaged, and no burden that is shifted to out of state interest. That is where the dormant Commerce Clause is primarily --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36956 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So long as the government enters the commercial market, it can, it can create Fortress California?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36957 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We're not asking for a rule that broad, Your Honor. What we are suggesting is that where you have a publicly owned operation, a government operation, and it does not disproportionately benefit in state or local interests, as against out of state interests -- But it always does. It benefits the people of the State, who make the money from the money from the, from the very expensive hamburgers that are sold by the State of California.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36958 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36959 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It always benefits the State of California.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36960 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36961 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you're saying so long as it doesn't benefit one particular malefactor of great wealth in the State of California, it is okay.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36962 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36963 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't see the distinction as far as the harm to the national market is concerned.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36964 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you were to have government action, for example, someone suggested could the government sell hamburgers. I believe Justice Alito suggested that, and that was to operate to the disadvantage of out of state interests, even if it only advantaged one in state interest, we would agree that that would be appropriate for treatment under strict scrutiny. But that's not what you have here. What both the district court and the circuit court in fact found here is that the primary burden of these local ordnances in fact is on local residents. And so the political process check that this Court has found critical in cases like Minnesota versus Cloverleaf and Wunnicke is very much precedent here. This is not an attractive proposition that these localities have entered into.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36965 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What would you do with Justice Alito's question? Dean Milk versus Madison: All milk must be processed whether been 20 miles of where it's --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36966 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36967 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- produced.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36968 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36969 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Held discriminatory against interstate commerce. Could -- under your view, could your city require all milk be pasteurized within your city at a government owned, city owned facility?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36970 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that rule imposed no disproportionate benefits on out of state --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36971 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but Justice Scalia says it always does because it benefits the locality.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36972 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's different if it benefits --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36973 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You have -- by criminal laws --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36974 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- I'm sorry. We're looking at the interstate aspect from the wrong point of view. I'm a home owner. I have two choices. I either send it to the local facility or I can ship it over to New Jersey. You're telling me I can't ship it to New Jersey. Doesn't that burden an interstate transaction?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36975 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is very different from those kinds of export bans. Those export bans did one of two things.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36976 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is an export ban.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36977 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The export bans that this Court has struck down either created local --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36978 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your case involves an expert ban. All the trash has to be processed in your tipping facility.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36979 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does, and it does, and to the extent that's what you are characterizing as an export ban, that's certainly correct. What the Court has found problematic about export bans are either that they are put in place to create local to correct economic opportunities, for example the timber cases or the shrimp cases. That's not what you have here. There's no allegation that the purposes of these statutes is to foster or promote local industry. In fact, the only plaintiffs in this case are local haulers themselves.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36980 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there is an allegation that you charge above market rates to pursue particular economic goals that the municipality has.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36981 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ For a different basket of services, Your Honor. A basket of services that includes a wider range of, of goals that the private sector has no Interest in providing. To return, to return to the question of whether or not this is an inappropriate benefit for the citizens, I would argue that there is a meaningful distinction between government taking an action which benefits the citizens as a whole, which we would hope any government law would -- any law passed by a government would do, as opposed to a law that benefits a local private economic interest and is intended to do so. For the dormant Commerce Clause to reach that far would be unprecedented. It would implicate not only electricity but under Petitioner's theory it would implicate, I would think for example government decisions to provide prison and correctional services through a public system as opposed to a private one. What about school bus services? Car insurance --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36982 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If only facilities on your side of the case that are traditional municipal services, but then this seems to be at the borderline. I mean, on the other side, they have the hamburger cases or the milk processing cases. How do we decide whether this is one of the traditional governmental services, the police, the prisons, whatever, or is it one of these that looks more like regular market participation?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36983 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Two answers if I can, Your Honor. First of all, I think this Court has answered that question with respect to waste management more than a hundred years ago in the California Reduction case. It was clearly held there the provision of waste management services is an essential function that governments appropriately provide. So that's been answered here. With respect to this question about hamburgers and other services that look commercial, I think there are two checks on those kinds of ordinances. First of all, I think it is very likely that in most circumstances if you were to say that hamburgers will be sold at a government operated facility, that that would disadvantage local interests significantly, and there would be a political process check. Secondly the Court has been clear that it is not bound by formalistic distinctions in the Commerce Clause arena and so it will look for discrimination that is protectionist in nature whether it is, as the Court has said, forthright or ingenious. So if case were to present itself, and the facts in the facts in this case no whiff of that protectionism, where you were to believe that the motive of a government entity was, in fact, to favor some local private interest, then strict scrutiny might be appropriate.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36984 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that what it turns on, the motive? If the motive were to keep the jobs at the plant in New York, rather than in some facility outside of New York, that would be, that would make a difference?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36985 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I think this Court has held the purpose alone cannot cure an inappropriate means that is used. But what we are arguing is that here you have both a very legitimate purpose, as my co-counsel outlined for you; you also have appropriate means. It is not inappropriate under the dormant Commerce Clause for the government to step in and take over provision of a service. Petitioners themselves agree that, in fact, the government could take over waste management services from soup to nuts. They suggest that there is some difference of a constitutional magnitude because some aspect of that is contracted out to the private market, and would argue that actually turns the dominant Commerce Clause on its head. One final point, if I could make. Several of you asked about whether or not there are other mechanisms that the localities could use to further these goals, goals which are set forth in both Federal and State laws. First of all, under the Pike test, there is no least restrictive alternative test. So it is not required that the localities demonstrate that there is no other option that might meet these goals. The Second Circuit concluded and rightly so I think on page 20a of the appendix to the petition that there was no other option that presented itself in the record that the counties could address, or could use to address their liability concerns and to encourage recycling across a very wide range of products.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36986 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is no determinative element in the Pike test whatever. It is a totality of the circumstances test, right?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36987 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36988 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's wonderful. (Laughter.)
05-1345 +++$+++ 36989 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And we suggest that that is the appropriate test here.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36990 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Ms. Halligan, how do you answer something in the Petitioner's brief that says there's no difference between this case and Carbone because these transfer stations are constructed and operated by a private company?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36991 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that that distinction is essential here. It is essential because of the purposes of the dormant Commerce Clause. These are publicly owned facilities. The facility in Carbone was privately owned and as you suggested, Justice Ginsburg, the opinion is replete with careful references to that.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36992 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where do you, where do you come out on the 50-50 facility?
05-1345 +++$+++ 36993 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that's a hard question, Your Honor. And I think there the kind of approach that the Court took in a case like Westland Creamery and Hunt versus Washington Apple is helpful. If it appears to the Court that the motive is protectionist then it is appropriate to apply strict scrutiny. Whether that line is 50 percent, 55 percent --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36994 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I thought you said earlier motive was not the test, in response to I think it was Justice Alito.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36995 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. HALLIGAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. I'm saying you should look as you have -- and I see my time is up. If I may continue -- you should look as you have, in all of the dormant Commerce Clause cases at the context that is presented. So if there is 100 --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36996 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you. Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Tager you have three minutes remaining.
05-1345 +++$+++ 36998 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. The first point I'd like to make is I'd like to ask the Court to review Reeves versus Stake which is a market participant case. But what is significant there -- that's the cement plant case -- there's two significant things about that case which I think are of interest. First, the Court's footnote 1 is an interesting historical footnote about how South Dakota had elected to make a lot of these different industries state-run industries, so the hypotheticals we've been discussing are not completely off the wall. If you can do it for waste you can do it for, in that case coal. They wanted to do it for stockyards but I think the legislature rejected the government's proposal. So the hypos are right on point. Secondly, the Court made a point there in rejecting the argument, the constitutional argument that the state was not prohibiting competing cement companies. And I think the inference from that is that it had, there would have been a Commerce Clause problem. Second, Mr. Cahill's user -- user fee point. I just want to remind the Court that in addition to paying for the recycling and everything, they were using the user fee to pay off the bond for their failed energy recovery facility. So, if you start focusing on what you use it for, it is a very slippery slope. On his point about protecting the generator from liability, we've addressed that at great lengths in our briefs. But one other point I want to make is he's wrong about their ability to determine whether other facilities that the haulers want to use are safe for environmental purposes. That's exactly what the city of New York does. Because it doesn't have its own disposal facility, its got very stringent requirements for where the waste can be taken. Fourth, Justice Souter, I believe you were raising an inquiry about the political process and whether that's adequate to protect the out of State interests. And I'd like to refer you to the West Lynn Creamery decision where the Court said the people whose oxen are being gored by a tariff are the local residents as well, but a tariff is the prototypical Commerce Clause violation. The political process is simply not a good answer to our argument. In terms of your other question about --
05-1345 +++$+++ 36999 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A tariff is also imposed by a State, isn't it? As opposed to --

05-1345 +++$+++ 37002 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. TAGER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would go to a State. I suppose it could be done by a subdivision, though. On Ms. Halligan's point about California Reduction, I just would like to remind the Court that that was a case of flow control to a private company. So Carbone, to the extent that case was concerned at all with the Commerce Clause, and it didn't say that it was, it was a taking case, I think, it has been overruled to the extent it had any Commerce Clause implications. Finally, I would like end with the point that Carbone has been the law for 13 years -- may I finish? If the Respondents have a problem with Carbone, Congress can fix it. That's one of the unique things about the Commerce Clause that is different from other constitutional provisions.
05-1345 +++$+++ 37003 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37007 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++  +++$+++ Now we'll hear argument in 05-1382, Gonzales versus Planned Parenthood Federation of America. General Clement.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37009 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: This case presents the same basic constitutional question concerning the Federal Partial-Birth Abortion Act as the first case. Of course, the Ninth Circuit in the decision under review here went much further in invalidating the Federal act. If I could begin by talking about whether what we're talking about here is medical necessity or just some marginal effect on the risks. I think in order to fairly understand the argument that respondents are making in this case, their argument has to be a matter of simply marginal risks, because one illustration of this, as I indicated in the first argument, if a doctor really believes that a D&X procedure is the way to go in a case then there's no ban on the procedure as such. What the act bans is the infliction of the D&X procedure on a living fetus. So if a doctor really thinks the D&X procedure is the way to go, he can induce fetal demise at the outset of the procedure.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37010 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the problem with this is that there -- well, some doctors absolutely agree. I mean, you know, my list over here, in which I have hundreds of references from this thing, is doctor after doctor who takes the other position, and they say: Look, all that we're doing here is trying to remove the fetus in a single pass. The fetus is going to die anyway. It's not viable. We're trying to remove it in a single pass, and the reason we're trying to do that is if we don't, there may be bone fragments left inside the womb. There may be fetal parts left inside the womb. Every time you make another pass, it turns out there's an added risk of scarring or hurting the inside of the womb. If you try to induce demise through a drug before, there is serious risks of introducing drugs into the system. If the woman has uterine cancer, it's a serious problem of not trying to get the child out as quickly as possible. If you have preeclampsia or eclampsia, where you're in a situation where the woman will be dead in five minutes or 10 minutes, there could be such a situation. The doctor thinks only one thing: Get it out as fast as possible. All right. Now, I know there are doctors who think the contrary. There's lots of testimony of the doctors who think roughly along the lines I've taken. That was true in Stenberg as well. So I think the issue is not that you don't have support -- you do -- but that the support is contraverted, and therefore, what do we do in that case?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37011 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Breyer, let me take as a point of departure the specific risks that you associated with the injection that induces fetal demise, because if there isn't a significant risk to that injection, then all the other benefits that are associated with the D&X procedure don't matter because they can perform the D&X procedure. Now if you look through the record on this point, I think you will not find any testimony that supports a significant risk from that injection. Yes, there are risks because there are risks from any medical procedure, but the risks are not significant.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37012 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is there a definition in the law of significant risk, other than doctors saying, I've been trained to try to save life and I want to perform the safest possible way? Is there some legal definition of what's a small risk, a big risk, a giant risk?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37013 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With all respect, I think if a single injection that doesn't take any particular risk other than the fact that it's an injection, if that counts as a significant risk, then we might as well strike the word "significant" from the discussion in Stenberg. And Then I think what you have is that it's very clear that their position is one of zero tolerance for any marginal risk to maternal health.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37014 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, my question is the same as Justice Breyer's. Is there anything in the literature, including medical literature, that talks about significant or minor risks? I mean, you fill out forms when you go to the dentist about risks. Now, if -- if the chance of death is one out of 100, is that significant? I mean, I don't know.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37015 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's a very difficult question to evaluate in the abstract, Justice Kennedy. And I think it actually, that question, though, has direct bearing on this case, because Congress after all found that there was some risks with the D&X procedure. The most prominent one that I would point to is the risk of cervical incompetence because the D&X procedure does -- it does require additional dilation, which can be associated with risks of losing future pregnancies. And that was born out, although not at a level of statistical significance, in the Chasen study by a plaintiff practitioner, where 2 of the 17 women who had the D&X procedure and were available for follow-up care had an early pre-term pregnancy in the follow-up. So I think those risks are born out in the only study that's available. And I think the question becomes, now, if D&X were some life-saving procedure for something that there was no other known cure for, you might think, well, those are the risks you run. But when there remains available the D&E procedure, which has been well tested and works every single time as a way to terminate the pregnancy, then I think risks that, if you were talking about a life-saving treatment for some life-threatening condition with no known cure, those risks might not be significant in that context.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37016 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but there is a risk if the uterine wall is compromised by cancer or some forms of preeclampsia and it's very thin, there's a risk of being punctured.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37017 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is a risk, Justice Kennedy, but I think that, first of all, that even in those limited circumstances, that the marginal risk between the D&X procedure and the D&E procedure are really as far as I can tell nonexistent. Even in that condition, unless there's some reason not to put the injection in, if the doctor really thought the D&X procedure was the way to go, he could begin, as Dr. Carhart does in every single case after the 17th week and start off with a digoxin injection or potassium chloride injection, induce fetal demise, and he has nothing to worry about from this statute. And I think the very fact that they are attributing significant risks to a single injection shows that at bottom their position is a zero tolerance position. And that's a legitimate position, I suppose, but it's completely inconsistent with this Court's precedence, most notably the Casey decision. Because if all you needed to do is point to some marginal risk, then this Court should have struck down the 24-hour waiting period in the Casey decision, because the plaintiffs there said the 24-hour waiting condition has imposed significant risks. They were backed in that point by an amicus brief by ACOG. But this Court didn't say, well, you know, you're right, there's marginal risks, we're going to apply a zero tolerance rule. This Court instead upheld the 24-hour period, even though it required overruling Akron I's contrary decision and this Court pointed, of course, to Akron I as an exemplar of the pre-Casey decisions that put too little weight on the legitimate countervailing interest that the government has in this area. And so with respect, I think that the argument they are making is effectively an argument for returning to Akron I and Thornburgh, where the rule of law was that there would be no interference between a doctor and the doctor's patient and the doctor's best judgment as to how to treat the patient. This Court of course consciously moved away from that in Casey and expressly repudiated the language in Akron I and Thornburgh to that effect.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37018 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I follow up on a question the Chief Justice asked you during the last argument? We got into the government's construction of the statute to narrow it to intentional situations. Would you explain a little more exactly what situations you would exclude and what you would include in your interpretation of the statute?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37019 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, justice Stevens, let me answer it this way and maybe if you want me to take you specifically to the text, I can do that. But I think the bottom line would be that under our view of the statute, the most important thing is for those doctors, like Dr. Cranen or Dr. Vivicar, who try to do the D&E procedure every time, and they succeed 99 or 100 percent of the time. Well, in the 1 percent of the cases where they inadvertently deliver the fetus past the anatomical landmark, we would say they are not covered by the statute because they would not satisfy what is really a compound mens rea requirement in the statute, which requires that the delivery of the fetus be intentional and deliberate and for the purpose of committing the overt act of killing fetus. And in those cases, of course, the intent of the doctor performing the D&E isn't to deliver the fetus at all; it's to deliver a fetal arm or a fetal leg as part of the dismemberment procedure. So they would not be covered by the mens rea requirement of the statute.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37020 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would you measure the mens rea at the outset of the procedure when they begin the dilation a day or two before the actual operation is performed, or is it at the time of beginning the operation?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37021 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think you could measure it from either time point. I think the better view is actually that it would be measured from the beginning of the surgical operation, though the evidence of their intent at the beginning of the dilation would be very, very relevant. The reason I would say that is I think if somebody tries to dilate and then gets an extreme amount of dilation at the point they start the procedure, I think the intent of Congress would still be for them to do a dismemberment procedure at that point, rather than an intact removal. But if this Court thought that the constitutional line mattered on the answer to that, then you could start from the beginning of the dilation because I think in fairness the differences between the two procedures are probably most manifest in the dilation regimen. I also think, though, the record supports the notion that there are differences even once you begin the procedure as to how you manipulate the fetus. I mean, Dr. Chasen for example, who is trying to do the intact removal, says that after he has one leg removed he effectively tries to reach back up and swing the second leg across so he can remove the entire fetal body. If you're -- obviously if you're performing a dismemberment D&E you're not trying to swing the second leg across; you're simply continuing to pull or twist on the first extremity that prevents itself. So I think there are differences even at the procedural level. So I think that it would probably be most consistent with Congress's intent to measure it from the beginning of the surgical part of the procedure. But if you, as I say, in order to save the statute, I think it's amenable to the contrary interpretatio.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37022 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think you're wrong about -- you're probably wrong about this. But just before you leave, I mean, this is why it's so hard for me to get into the medical procedure. I heard you as saying, perhaps wrongly, that well, the doctor can always use a lethal injection to kill the fetus. All right? That rang a bell. So I look up and see what the lower courts said about that and what they said is that nearly everyone agrees it is not always possible to kill the fetus by injection.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37023 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, but can I respond to that specifically?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37024 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He says It is not always possible -- what?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37025 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can I respond to that specifically?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37026 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, he then goes; he tells you why. He says there is a Dr. Knorr who says you can't do it when the woman has a prior surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease. And then another one says they are not considered appropriate candidates because of medical illness or cardiovascular disease, etcetera. So there's a list of medical situations where they couldn't use a fetal injection.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37027 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer, if I could respond to that.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37028 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37029 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, there are certain situations where the injection is contraindicated. I think they'd be relatively rare situations. And I think, you know, you could imagine I suppose that the statute might pose a problem if you could identify particular conditions where a D&X was particularly useful, and those were also situations where an injection would be contraindicated. I think, you know, the universe of that may be zero, it may be one in a million; I don't know, but it's very small. Another point that's made in the record which I think is important is they suggest well, you know, maybe, maybe if you can't do the injection into the heart of the fetus, then you're only going to be successful something like 92 percent of the times. I think though for purposes of the mens rea requirement would certainly take care of any concern that the physician would have --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37030 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's bothering me, why I'm using this as an illustration is that there are so many of these things. Of course there are special cases. We are only talking about a few, rare special cases. And as soon as you tell me that what's supposed to happen is that the judges are supposed to start deciding whether this is one of these unusual cases or not, rather than relying upon significant medical opinion, as this doctor is now illustrating, I don't see how it's going to work. At least I don't see how it's going to work without some people suffering serious illness as a result of mistakes by the judge.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37031 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer, I wish we were talking about just a few rare cases because I think if we were, there would be, the statute would be amenable to not being applied in those rare cases. But this is one thing that I think my colleagues on the other side of the podium will agree with me on, is that their doctors don't think that this is a safer procedure in rare cases. They think it's a safer procedure every single time. And that's why doctors like Dr. Chasen and Dr. Frederickson try to do the D&X procedure every single time, and they don't do it because they are indifferent to health, I suppose. In their best judgment they think that's the better way to go. And it's just a question ultimately of whether you're going to defer to individual doctors' judgments, even when it's very much of a minority judgment; I mean anything you want to say about this procedure it is the heterodox procedure, not the orthodoxy. Most ob-gyns are going to do the D&E procedure, not the D&X procedure. Even in the Nebraska case three of the four plaintiffs don't try to do the intact removal, so I think that just gives you, just a, know you, anecdotal observation that you are talking about the rare procedure, the heterodox procedure. And so the question is when you have a perfectly safe alternative, and you have some doctors who like to do is it a different way, can Congress countermand the doctors' judgment or do the doctors get the final word?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37032 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose the doctor has the intent, the good faith intent to perform a standard in utero D&E, and he knows because of what's happened in the last three months, with women with this particular shaped fetus and particular position of the fetus, that the chances are 50 percent, 60 percent that it's going to be an intact delivery, at which point he is presented with the problem. Does he have the prohibitive intent? Because aren't you, don't you have an intent to commit the, most likely consequences of your acts?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37033 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think so. I mean that might be a situation -- I don't know that that's a realistic hypothetical, I mean, let me just say that. If that turned out to be a realistic hypothetical, that might be an example of where this question I talked about with Justice Stevens might matter. Which is in that case it might matter whether or not the intent was measured --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37034 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's important to me because you seem to think that there is a standard D&E. In reading the medical testimony it seemed to me that D&Es ought to result in result in intact deliveries quite without the intent of the doctor. Now maybe that's wrong.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37035 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With respect, Justice Kennedy, I don't think that's born out in this record, it's the other way, which is doctors who want to perform a D&X, often, in a majority of the cases end up performing a D&E. But the doctors that set out to perform a D&E, in Dr. Vibhakar's case she says a hundred percent of the time, she ends up with dismemberment. Dr. Creinen says it's 99% of the time that he ends up with dismemberment.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37036 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I gather your submission is that we can tell who is setting out to perform which, by the dilation protocol. Those were the record references that you gave earlier?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37037 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. And you can, you can, you can tell you can tell from the fact that a doctor, like one of the plaintiffs in the Nebraska case, Dr. Fitzhugh, says, that, well, I don't do the intact removal because if I wanted to do that I would have to do a second round of dilation with a second round of laminarias. And of course, that second round of laminaria is also a medical procedure. Like the injection, every medical procedure has some risks, risks of infection. If you looked at Dr. Creinen's testimony, this is at 174 A to 177 A in the Eighth Circuit petition appendix, he says that he doesn't like to do a second round of laminaria dilation because it's painful to the patient. And that's his testimony. So there are countervailing indications here. And as I say, this idea of trying to prohibit a practice that involves further dilation is not an irrelevant concern from a health standpoint, because one of the things that Congress heard was that there were risks to future pregnancies from cervical incompetence. And that's a particularly important concern because first of all, the plaintiff's experts aren't in a very good position to evaluate that risk because they provide abortion services, not follow-up services. So they're not in a good position to judge that risk. Second of all, the only study we have here points out that there is a greater incidence of that preterm delivery in the group that had a D&X procedure. Now again they say, they are going to come up and say well it's not statistically significant. But the numbers I think are striking. They had 17 women in the group that had a D&X and came back. Two of them had a preterm pregnancy. The D&E group was much larger, 45, and two of them had a preterm delivery. Now I think as a commonsense manner, if you know that you were going to be in a room with 17 people where two people were going to have something bad happen to them, or in a room with 45 and two -- bad things were going to happen to two, I know which room I'd like to be in. And all I'm pointing out --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37038 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, once you're making a point of that study, I think it was also the case that the ones that had the intact were older or rather further along in pregnancy; isn't that true?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37039 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37040 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Therefore the risks were greater.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37041 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well if I could just --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37042 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And therefore since the risks were greater, the other side says that this actually shows it was safer. I mean, I don't know how to evaluate that.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37043 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it's even more complicated than that, Justice Breyer, because in fact, you're right that the D&X patients were at a further gestational age, but the D&E patients were actually older. And so I think --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37044 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I missed that.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37045 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. But it happens that, the D&E patients were on average two years older, which I think also would be associated with greater risk. So I think it's a wash. But I still think the Chasen study net is quite helpful to our side. For one thing, this is a study put together by one of the plaintiff practitioners, a plaintiff in the Southern District case, based on a study of his own practice. And of course one of the intuitions about the D&X procedure is because you remove it intact it's going to be a faster procedure and there is going to be less blood loss.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37046 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ General Clement --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37047 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what did he find when he studied that? It was exactly the same for those two procedures. I'm sorry.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37048 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because your time is running out I did want to ask you about a feature of this legislation that hasn't come up so far, and that is perhaps stimulated by Stenberg. But up until now, all regulation on access to abortion has been state regulation and this measure is saying to the states, like it or not, the Federal Government is going to ban a particular practice and we are going to take away the choice from the states, in an area where up until now it's, it's been open to the states to make those decisions. How should that weigh in this case? And it is something new.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37049 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I mean I don't think it should figure in this Court's decision. I mean principally because the other side in neither case makes a challenge based on the Commerce Clause, and I suppose there is two reasons for that. That legal reason that they don't bring the challenge is because there is a jurisdictional element that I think would address the challenges as a doctrinal matter. The practical reason I think is because this isn't the only instance in which the Federal Government has gotten involved to address issues related to the abortion context.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37050 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well I know, when it is a question of funding --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37051 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well but also access to clinics, in the the face act, which is also --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37052 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The bes example where government has gotten involved in overriding what the states want to do is Casey. It seems rather odd for this Court to be concerned about stepping on the toes of the states.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37053 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- it's certainly true that abortion has been dealt with at a Federal level one way or another since 1973. So I think that's also part of the backdrop, but I also think, I mean, you know, the Federal Government gets involved in this issue, you know, depending on your perspective, for good or for harm. It's there to protect access to the abortion clinics --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37054 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ General Clement, That brings up a question I was intending to ask you. I notice the finding says nothing about interstate commerce but the statute says any physician who in or affecting interstate commerce performs the procedures. Does that mean that the procedure is performed in a free clinic, as opposed to a profit organization, it would not be covered?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37055 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, I don't think we have taken, the Federal Government hasn't taken a definitive position on that. I think it could be interpreted either way. I think my understanding is the face context, a free clinic would be covered. There's not a jurisdictional element in the face statute. So there may be differences as, in application.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37056 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But how could the Commerce Clause justify application to a free clinic? I don't understand.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37057 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think by, I mean, you know, the Court's precedents in other areas has suggested it's just not a matter of whether the ultimate service is provided in commerce but in order to get the services they have to take --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37058 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Activities that --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37059 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Exactly. I don't, I mean, that hasn't been briefed up in this case. If it had been we'd probably have a definitive position one way or another. But I don't think the constitutionality in this facial challenge where that hasn't been a feature of the challenge turns on the answer to that question one way or another. I think in regards to the Chasen study the last thing I would say about it though is that it's important because most of the arguments on the other side are intuitive arguments. They are intuitive arguments, that they would be less passive, so that will be more safe. And what I think is telling is that the same intuition would lead to the notion that it would be quicker and there will be less blood loss. And when that was actually tested in a controlled study, it turned out not to be the case. The last thing I'll say about the Chasen study is there was this indication that the two most serious complications were associated with the D&E procedure. But one thing that I think is important to understand about the Chasen study is it is a retrospective study of Dr. Chasen and his partner's own practice. Now what they do in every case is they set out to perform a D&X procedure, and so what they are studying and what they call the D&X procedures, that cohort are the times when they tried to do a D&X procedure and they were successful. The D&X cohort from this study, is you know, are those circumstances where he and his partner tried to do a D&X procedure, weren't successful and did a D&E procedure. Now why is that significant? Because it shows as Chasen noted in his article that in those situations that were D&Es and they were associated with serious complications there was nothing he could have done about it. He could have performed a D&X, he tried to perform a D&X and it wasn't successful, so he ended up performing a D&E. And so I really think on balance the Chasen study ends up supporting our position, because the first time you have any kind of controlled study what you find is that some of the intuition turns out not to be true, and the safety benefits from these are a wash, and the one sort of loose end from the study is the threat that you do see from the greater dilation. Now it's not statistically robust, but I think that it does bear out one of Congress's concerns.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37060 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could you address the question I asked respondent's counsel in the last case about the availability of other facilities? Because there are alternate methods but some of these require hospitalization, and my understanding is the hospitals aren't always open.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37061 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, I -- I --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37062 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So it doesn't make much sense to say well, there is an alternate procedure if you can't be admitted to the facility.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37063 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. And as I tried to indicate in rebuttal, that's really not a concern because, the difference is whether some clinics will only offer the D&X and the D&E and will say that basically you've got to go to a hospital to get the induction procedure. But that doesn't really, I don't think matter, because the point is anybody could can got a D&X who is at a clinic can also get a D&E. In every single case the doctor that can perform the D&X can also offer the D&E. And since the D&E is what the district court in the Nebraska case described as the gold standard of Casey, I think every woman in every case is going to have that option of a safe, of a safe pregnancy option. And again one way to illustrate that is Chasen.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37064 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But then you pin your whole case on the availability of D&E even though D&Es sometimes inadvertently turn into intact D&Es.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37065 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but, Justice Kennedy, I think we have our answer to that, which is the best reading of the statute requires the intent at the outset of the procedure, and therefore nobody -- in the 99 percent of the cases that Dr. Crainer sets out to performs a D&E and succeeds, there's no issue in the world because everybody would look at that and say that's a D&E. In the one case --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37066 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do you do that, because I looked at that part of the statute and, comparing it with the statute in Cathcart, the relevant part forbid a doctor from doing this for the purpose of performing an abortion that the doctor knows will kill the fetus. That's the language basically, right. And in this one it says you can't deliver past the fetal trunk for the purpose of performing an overt act that the doctor knows will kill the fetus. So I look at those two sets of words. I mean, I've simplified them slightly, but I don't see the difference. So if the one in Cathcart is viewed as too vague, why is the other one here not too vague?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37067 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Breyer, it's because of the addition of the anatomical landmark language to the Federal statute.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37068 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'll grant you that in respect -- if what Cathcart was worried about I guess was you didn't know what the words "significant substantial portion of the child," that tends to be cured. But if what Cathcart was worried about was the fact that a doctor who sets out to perform a D&E will, making a pass, think he'll have the fetus dismembered and, lo and behold, it doesn't dismember, so the bottom portion of the fetus descends outside the womb. And there he is and now what happens? If that's the concern, then I guess you'd agree that that same concern exists here.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37069 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, only with the caveat, though, is that I think this Court really didn't have to confront the second concern because it had the first concern. And if you thought that a leg, which this Court did, was a substantial portion, and that was the, that was the act that induced fetal demise, either way it was covered no matter what your purpose was, because the doctor's purpose in removing the leg was to induce fetal demise. Here the compound mens rea requirement works with the anatomical landmark language, so that what you need to satisfy the statute is the deliberate and purposeful intent to remove the fetus past the navel with the purpose of performing an overt act that will, will lead to fetal demise, which is not covered when you don't even have the intent to take it out of the -- past the anatomical landmark in the first place and you're trying to do something that's going to take place in utero. If I could reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37070 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, General Clement. Miss Gartner.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37072 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: In Casey, this Court reaffirmed that the government cannot ban pre-viability abortions. Despite Casey, Stenberg suggested that there is a narrow category of pre-viability abortions, intact D&Es, as this Court understood that term in Stenberg, that can be banned so long as the ban contains a health exception. But I'd like to leave the health exception question aside for a minute and turn to the scope of the law that Congress has enacted here. The question is whether Congress can enact a pre-viability abortion ban that does not track the hallmark of intact D&E abortions as this Court understood that term in Stenberg and by doing so to ban a substantially greater array of abortions than would be banned had the law faithfully tracked the language in the Stenberg opinions about what constitutes an intact D&E. And I'm referring both to the majority opinion in Stenberg and in the dissents. It is our position that this Court must reject Congress's effort to exploit the limited license that this Court seemingly granted in Stenberg because to allow such an expansion of pre- viability abortions that can be banned would set the stage for continued legislative efforts to ban other iterations of the classic D&E method of abortion until truly there would be nothing left at all of Casey's holding that it is unconstitutional to ban pre- viability second trimester abortions. The government in this case has conceded that the act bans more abortions than merely the intact D&E as this Court understood it in Stenberg. But I want to highlight for the Court how the language of this act departs from the hallmarks of intact D&E and how these departures place doctors at risk of prosecution for the very facet of D&E abortions, and by that I mean all D&E abortions, that enhance their safety. There is three respects in which the act departs from the hallmarks of intact D&E as understood in Stenberg. First, the act does not require breach extraction of an intact fetus to the head, one of the primary hallmarks that this Court understood in Stenberg. Instead, the act applies once the fetus is extracted past the navel, a far more frequent occurrence than extraction to the head. And in fact the government in its briefing both in their initial brief and in their reply concedes that in any of what the government calls standard D&Es a living fetus can be extracted past the fetal navel before demise occurs. In addition, the act does not require the fetus to be delivered intact at the end of the procedure, another component of what is considered to be a hallmark of intact D&E in Stenberg. In fact, the word intact appears nowhere in the statute and again the government concedes that some non-intact D&Es would violate this law as drafted. In fact, the government contends that one of the "advantages," in its words, is that the law would ban more than intact D&E. And finally, the act does not require that the fetus be extracted in a breach presentation at all, even though in Stenberg the Court thought of the breach extraction as one of the hallmarks of intact D&E. Now this --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37073 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you -- I think this question was asked earlier, but I want your position. How often does the vertex delivery occur in a D&X procedure? I --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37074 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, two, two doctors in particular, Dr. Chasen and Dr. Hammond, testified that they have used in their practice the vertex presentation to treat women who, as Ms. Smith indicated, the fetus suffered from a serious lethal anomaly that involved a greatly distended abdomen. The fetus presented in a head-first presentation. The head delivered through the dilated cervix, but the only way to complete the procedure was to reduce the size of the, of the abdomen that was, that was anomalous in size because of the underlying fetal condition. In those cases, those doctors testified that that was absolutely the safest way to terminate the pregnancy for the woman. The only alternative way would have been abdominal surgery, which, which all the, virtually all of the doctors, even the government's doctors, agreed carries far greater risks for the woman than a vaginal surgical abortion.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37075 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Miss Gartner, with regard to your argument that the statute here did not track what you have described as the characteristics, the hallmarks, I think the answer from the other side is that the, the theory of this statute is a theory of a clear line between a legitimate abortion and infanticide. And if that is the theory, then whether it's a breach delivery or a non-breach delivery is irrelevant. What would your answer be to that?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37076 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, two answers, Your Honor. First of all, the clear line that this Court drew in Stenberg was essentially the line at intact delivery to the head followed by an act that results in fetal demise. Very clearly what this Court understood in Stenberg could -- was, was an intact D&E and several members of the court suggested that that would be constitutional to ban. In addition, the government today seems to suggest --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37077 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we said that that would be an appropriate line. But the question here is is it really essential to an appropriate line that we talk, that we describe it as a, as a breach delivery or a non-breach delivery.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37078 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I would agree that of the three hallmarks that the Court recognized in Stenberg, the breach delivery is probably the least, the least central; that the other two hallmarks, the extraction to the head followed by a completely intact delivery after demise, were absolutely the hallmarks that everyone on this Court understood in Stenberg, and those, those lines, are nowhere in the statute that Congress enacted. Today General Clement seems to be arguing that there is a different line that's protected in this statute, a different line than the Court recognized in Stenberg, and the line is about where the fetus is when demise occurs. But, but this Court in Stenberg understood that even in a classical D&E, a standard D&E, as the government calls it, part of the fetus is outside the woman's uterus when fetal demise occurs. The Court recognized that fetal demise occurs even in a standard D&E when, after a part of the fetus is drawn out of the women's uterus, resistance is met, disarticulation occurs, and after that fetal demise. So even in a standard D&E the line that the government today is offering up, the line of inside or outside the uterus, would be violated in any D&E --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37079 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understood the statute here to apply only when the, in the words of the statute, that the partially delivered infant is killed after passing the anatomical landmark.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37080 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's right, Your Honor.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37081 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So we just say your hypothetical about extraction of the leg it seems to be would not be covered by the statute.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37082 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor, that's right. But what I'm saying is that some part of the fetus, no matter what, is outside the women's uterus, whether it's an intact D&E, a non-intact D&E --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37083 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But we don't talk about a leg dying. We talk about the fetus dying, I think, and I think that's not the leg.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37084 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the important point is that the government acknowledges that in a standard D&E, what it calls standard D&Es, the fetus can be extracted past the anatomical landmark. So the anatomical landmark isn't a bright-line decision between intact D&Es and non-intact D&Es. But in Stenberg this Court drew that line between intact D&Es and non-intact D&Es. It suggested --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37085 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where does the government concede that in a standard D&E the living fetus is extracted past the anatomical landmark?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37086 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does so --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37087 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought that was -- I thought their position was that that was not the standard D&E.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37088 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. It does so in two places, Your Honor. On page 32 of their initial brief they refer to, they describe two circumstances that they say or two parts of the law that they say saved the law from banning non- intact D&Es. The first is the anatomical landmark and the second is the requirement of an overt act. They describe the overt act as saving non-intact D&Es that were not already excluded from the anatomical landmark requirement. So that suggests that there are some standard D&Es that would not be saved by the anatomical landmark requirement. In addition, in their reply brief on page 22 they explicitly say that the fetus is usually not delivered past the anatomic landmark in the standard D&E, but they don't say that that never occurs. So they do admit that that sometimes is the case, and in fact the government witness, doctor --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37089 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought their answer on that was that sometimes the D&E procedure will lead to a D&X procedure, but that the requirement of deliberately and intentionally removes those situations from the scope of the statute.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37090 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think that's not how I understood it, Your Honor. But in addition, the government witnesses, witness, Dr. Sadigian, admitted that in any standard D&E the fetus can be extracted past the navel, the anatomic landmark of the navel, of the naval, even in a standard.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37091 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Prior to demise?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37092 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right, Your Honor.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37093 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did you understand the government's argument or answer to that to be, well, if the intent did not exist, if there was not an intent to do that, then the doctor is not liable?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37094 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I think this gets to the point I was going to make about the safety of doing abortions in a way that would be banned by the law, and that's that in every D&E, regardless of whether the intent is to do an intact D&E or not an intact D&E, the intent is to minimize the insertion of instruments into the uterus and to extract the fetus as intact as possible, because each insertion of the instruments increases the risk of causing harm to the woman's uterus. And so in every D&E, regardless of whether the physician expects to have an intact fetus at the very end of the procedure, they do want to minimize the -- the amount of instrumentation and bring it out in as few parts as possible and so there is a deliberate and intentional delivery of the fetus as far as possible which often can be past the navel, though in most cases it won't be up to the head. So that's why the line that this Court drew in Stenberg is the line that first of all delineates between two distinct procedures: intact D&E and nonintact D&E. The difference between those two procedures is whether the fetus is extracted to the head or not to the head before demise occurs. This, this statute doesn't draw that line. It draws a different line and in doing that, it captures far more abortions than the other law would and, and the key thing is that if this law stands with the past the navel line the inevitable result is that doctors in order to try to avoid the reach of this statute will have to stop trying to minimize the instrumentation and stop trying to draw the fetus out as intact as possible because often when that happens --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37095 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My concern with your argument is it's not just the anatomical line. The statute, I guess the Solicitor General referred to this as the multiple mens rea requirement. It's not simply the extraction to a particular anatomical landmark but with the purpose of demise at that point. So, if in the typical D&E the demise is going to be accomplished before extraction passed the anatomical landmark. It wouldn't be covered by this law.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37096 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I guess to some extent it comes down to what intent means but if what it means that the doctors would prefer, would like it to come out as far as possible before they have to take any, any kind of action to clear an obstructing part, that's, that's what they intend. The doctor only uses disarticulation when it's necessary to clear an obstruction because the continued extraction --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37097 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What about the Solicitor General's reference with respect to the differing protocols on dilation which suggests a different intent going into the procedure for the D&E and D&X?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37098 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, two points, Your Honor. One is the statute makes no mention of dilation protocols even though some group like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists when they intend to define an intact D&E abortion they've defined it specifically by reference to dilation protocols. And some state statutes have also used dilation protocols as part of the definition of intact D&E but this statute makes no mention of dilation protocols.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37099 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but the dilation protocol certainly would be relevant on the question of intent which this statute does refer to, wouldn't it?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it would be relevant, Your Honor, but I think it's not -- it really can't be dispositive of the physician's intent be --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Some doctors use a one day protocol, some doctors use a two day protocol but that in of itself isn't --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you're telling us that some do this and some do that and the question is why wouldn't following one protocol rather than another protocol very significant evidence of what was intended?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37104 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because some doctors use a two day protocol, Your Honor, even if they don't expect to get an intact D&E. There is not a direct correlation, there's some correlation between the amount of dilation and the percentage of times that a physician achieves intact D&E. To some extent doctors also use other agents to dilate, they use misoprostol and medication. That even if they're doing a one day protocol --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37105 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do we have any indication in your case about the effective safety of any other aspect of this procedure if these doctors would change their, their method of operation and go to a one-day protocol?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37106 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In terms, one-day protocol?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37107 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37108 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Some doctors -- I think one thing is that doctors perform abortions most safely when they do them in a way that they are most accustomed do. They are doing them the way they were trained to do them.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37109 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't want to cut your answer but I want to know whether there is anything specifically in the record in your case that bears on my question.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37110 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is nothing specific about doctors changing protocols. There is significant evidence about increased risks if doctors were to stop trying to extract the fetus as intact as possible. Several witnesses, including several government witnesses have agreed.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37111 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you mean start and stop with a different intent?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37112 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right, Your Honor.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37113 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As opposed to adopting a completely different procedure entirely -- a different protocol entirely.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37114 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, no actually even the other government witness, Dr. Cook, agreed that -- and the other government witness, Dr. Lockwood, agreed that removing the fetus as intact as possible in any D&E is the safest way to perform a D&E procedure regardless of whether the intent was to do an intact D&E procedure.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37115 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ For such a doctor, a doctor who thinks that I'm trying to remove in this emergency situation as much of the fetus as possible as quickly as possible, would such a doctor often, never, sometimes be thinking what I think is likely to happen here, I'll make a pass at the fetus, try to draw it out, and what's most likely to happen is that the trunk, a lot of it will come out and then the head of the fetus will dismember, after a lot of the trunk comes out. Is that --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37116 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would say it certainly is not never and it's not always. It's somewhere in between but I think --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So if a doctor is being honest about that, is there any way that such a doctor could escape the language of the statute on the government's interpretation?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think not Your Honor because the intent is to extract the fetus as intact as possible. In a good many cases it will be extracted past the navel though not to the head. So the doctor falls within the deliberately and intentionally language and I don't think, the government also proffers the idea of specific intent, but again because this statute doesn't track the actual differences between the two procedures, the having the specific intent doesn't save the statute. The doctor may intend to perform the abortion as defined in this law but not intend to do an intact D&E and that was the testimony in these cases.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would you clear up one thing for me? You say it's always the doctor's intent to extract as much as possible before causing fetal demise. I thought there was significant number of cases in which there was a deliberate decision to cause fetal demise before I start any extraction?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor there is testimony in our case, in the California case, that a few doctors that testified said the beginning at approximately 22 weeks of pregnancy, they offered women the option of undergoing a fetal demise injection before the procedure began. But the testimony was also overwhelming, including from the government witnesses, that that injection procedure carries significant risks for some women. For example, women with either susceptibility to infection, like women with HIV or hepatitis, you definitely don't want to do an additional injection. That in addition --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ From the point of view of the doctor it would be the safest thing to avoid criminal responsibility.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- but the problem is as the district court, found it's an unnecessary medical procedure that subjects the woman to additional risk. Now if the doctors --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why would the doctors in that case propose that option to their patients?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ At 22 weeks and later, as the abortion is getting closer to the viability line, the doctors feel that some women would feel more -- it's for psychological reasons for the woman. That's why it's an offer; it's not a requirement.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what -- what are the psychological reasons?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37126 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If she would prefer that the fetus undergo demise before the extraction begins, some women may feel better about that. The testimony was also that other women absolutely don't want that. And you know, feel that they -- you know, it's a very personal question that really goes to the heart of this case. It's a very personal decision how the woman who has made this very difficult moral/religious decision to end her pregnancy, often for very tragic reasons, how does she want the fetus to undergo demise? Different people will have different views about this. But here Congress has legislated that for the woman and done so pre-viability, when the state interests really are insufficient to require the woman to undergo a procedure that is not marginally safer but significantly safer for her.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37127 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well is there a difference between, in your view, in the constitutionality, marginally safer and significantly safer? In other words, I take it we don't, you obviously were here for the discussion in the prior case. We don't have evidence on marginal significant. And do you think it matters; if in fact it's a marginal difference in safety, does that, is that still enough to override Congress's interests in this case?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37128 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, it does matter. Marginal safety would not be enough but I think what is important is that you assess, you assess the question of marginal versus significant by looking at the averted harms. It's not a question of quantifying how many women would avert the harms.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37129 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, do we just look at the averted harms, or -- or do we, or Congress, also look at the incidence of the averted harms? Is it a theoretical -- is it a theoretical inquiry or is it to some extent a quantified inquiry?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37130 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I think it can't be a quantified, quantified inquiry. Ultimately this Court has never looked at the constitutional question of when an abortion statute interferes with a woman's health to an extent that it's unconstitutional, in terms of how many women are affected. The question is, is how seriously would a woman be affected if she affected? And the evidence here is overwhelming.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37131 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Doesn't the answer to my question turn largely on the age of the fetus? Isn't it a vast difference between the kind of decision the mother that is to make if it's a 14 week fetus on the one hand and 26 week fetus on the other?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm not sure if that's.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ For example, one of the congressional interests described in the finding is avoiding fetal pain to the fetus. And I guess they don't suffer any pain prior to 20 weeks but after 20 weeks there is some risk of pain. And that seems to me, that could affect a calculus very dramatically for the woman making the decision.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ For the woman, but I think the important point, Your Honor, is that this, that the intact D&E procedure, and the testimony was overwhelming to this effect, that -- in some cases this procedure averts catastrophic health consequences for the woman. It averts uterine perforation, it averts the spread of sepsis or infection; it averts the spread of -- potentially the spread of malignant cancer throughout the women's body.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if the woman can take into account the impact on the fetus at a certain point in time, and your option, as you said some physicians give, of fetal demise prior to the procedure, why is that beyond the scope of things that Congress can take into account?
05-1382 +++$+++ 37136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because what Congress has done here is take away from women the option of what may be the safest procedure for her. This Court has never recognized a state interest that was sufficient to trump the woman's interest in her health. If the woman and her doctor together agree that proceeding in this way is going to avert significant health risks to her, and the testimony here is overwhelming that there are situations where that occurs, this Court has never recognized a state interest that was sufficient to trump that woman's paramount interest in her health.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37137 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but we have -- we have said that that judgment has to reflect some kind of substantial medical judgment. It can't be an idiosyncratic determination by one doctor alone.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37138 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely, Justice Souter.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So to that extent --
05-1382 +++$+++ 37140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's -- and I take that -- and maybe that was my -- and I take this as a given here. Given the overwhelming testimony from doctors from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and this Court's holding in Stenberg, where the record was less robust, that we have that substantial medical authority here. And given that substantial medical authority, doctors need to be able to use their appropriate medical judgment, in the words of Roe and Casey, to provide this procedure for their patients when in their judgment -- not in their unfettered discretion, but in their sound clinical experience and medical judgment it's going to be the safest for her and avert catastrophic health consequences. So this is -- again, it may be that the number of women is not large, but for the women who are affected the impact of this ban is undoubtedly significant.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't want to misinterpret the Attorney General, the Solicitor General's remarks but he indicated in those case there could be an as applied challenge.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think, Justice Kennedy, you answered that question as well as I could. If a woman had to wait until she needed a banned abortion for her health, and file a proceeding wait for the court to grant relief, undoubtedly she would not get the relief she needed in time.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the answer that the Solicitor gave -- General gave to that was, you could have a pre-enforcement proceeding. That you can back up the clock.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37144 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. I'm not sure that I actually understood his answers though, because I think that that's what we have here, in fact, is a pre-enforcement proceeding to, to determine that this law blanketly banned intact D&E abortions even when the doctor believes it's, it would have significant health benefits for the patient. So this is not, I want to go back to, because my light is on, Stenberg suggested that there was a line that could constitutionally be drawn between banned, between permissibly banned procedures and, and procedures that have constitutional protection. But the statute didn't draw the line and it didn't draw that line in two ways. This, this statute defiantly rejected this Court's view that because there is substantial medical authority for the proposition that intact D&E is sometimes safer, a health exception is absolutely needed here, and they also refused to draw the line at what this Court understood was the defining difference between intact D&E and nonintact D&E. In the Solicitor General's reply brief they talk about the promise of Stenberg. Well, the promise of Stenberg was absolutely betrayed by Congress in this case in both respects, both in terms of preserving the health of the woman and allowing her to use what a substantial medical authority thinks is the safest procedure for the woman, and in terms of holding the line at a limited ban on pre-viability abortions given that Casey recognized that women have a constitutional right to choose to end their pregnancy pre-viability. I was going to address briefly some of the concerns that the Solicitor General offered about some of the health risks of intact D&E and cervical incompetence. Just briefly. The, all of the government witnesses in this case agreed that the congressional findings completely overstate any risks of intact -- there is no, there is no reasonable basis to conclude that intact D&E puts a woman at any greater risk of harm than standard D&E, and in fact the evidence is quite to the contrary. It averts catastrophic health consequences in some circumstances. There is no strong evidence that intact D&E has any impact on cervical incompetence. The Solicitor General talks at length about the two cases in Dr. Jason's study, but both of those women who experienced cervical incompetence had, in future pregnancy, had had cervical incompetence in prior pregnancies, and that's a condition that tends to stay with the woman. So there is no reason to think that it was the intact D&E itself that caused cervical incompetence in the subsequent pregnancies because of intact D&E. And finally, yes, it's true that Dr. Chasen used intact D&E or attempted to use intact D&E in all cases, and the women who had D&Es, three of them suffered very serious medical consequences after having a D&E. The Solicitor General says well, Dr. Chasen tried to do intact and he failed so, so there was really nothing to say about this law. But the fact is, if this law went into effect, no woman could have intact D&E. So even though, even in those cases where Dr. Chasen was able to do intact D&E, he would no longer be able to do that. So the incidence of those women having catastrophic health consequences, which in the Chasen study, three of the women having D&Es had catastrophic health consequences. Inevitably if this law is upheld, an intact D&E is not available as an option to doctors when in their judgment based on substantial medical authority, it's the best option for the woman. Inevitably there will be more and more women having D&Es and suffering catastrophic health consequences in situations where if intact D&E had been available, those catastrophic consequences could have been averted.

05-1382 +++$+++ 37146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. GARTNER +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you for your consideration, Your Honor.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ General Clement, you have three minutes remaining.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37149 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: A few final points. First of all, I don't think the constitutionality of Congress's act depends on whether the anatomical landmark is the navel or up to the head. Congress, as everyone recognizes, had to draw a line. I think drawing the line at more than halfway out is a pretty good place to draw the line. Second, my learned co-counsel is certainly correct. This is a pre-enforcement challenge, in response to your question, Justice Kennedy. But the point is, this is a pre-enforcement spatial challenge, and if the Court rejects it and allows this statute to go into operation, it will not foreclose the possibility of a future pre-enforcement as applied challenge that focuses on particular medical conditions. That's not something, though, that one can reach in this record, because as the district court in this case found at 147a, there is no specific condition here in which the D&X procedure is particularly ready met for or otherwise is medically necessary. Rather, the claims in this case are that it's always better. That's what some doctors say. It's a heterodox position, it's not the majority position, but it's not focussed on specific situations. The other thing it's not focused on, and this is in reference to something that Justice Breyer mentioned, it's not focused on emergencies. Another thing that the district court noted at page 128a of its opinion is that the D&E procedure and the D&X procedure, neither of them are particularly good in dealing with true medical emergencies where time is of the essence, because both these procedures require substantial advance time to do the dilation. And since the D&X procedure requires more dilation, I actually think in an emergency, you'd probably end up performing the D&E procedure if you performed either one, because you'd need less time for the dilation in an emergency. The other thing I should point out is that, of course, there is this question about what's a significant risk. And one thing about the lethal injection at the beginning of the process, the Digoxin injection, is the other side concedes that the mother gets to make the choice as to whether or not to do that procedure. Well, Dr. Carhart does it as a matter of course after 17 weeks, and I certainly don't think anyone would suggest that Dr. Carhart is needlessly inflicting significant risks on his patients after 17 weeks by following that regimen in every case after 17 weeks. And I think it's worth noting that the legal regime that respondents would construct is a legal regime where the woman can decide whether or not to have that shot, Dr. Carhart can decide it for her and that's okay, but Congress can't make this judgment. But it's important to draw a line here, and say that fetal demise that takes place in utero is one thing. That is abortion as it has always been understood. But this procedure, the banned procedure is something different. This is not about fetal demise in utero. This is something that is far too close to infanticide for society to tolerate. Thank you.
05-1382 +++$+++ 37150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, General Clement. The case is submitted.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37154 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in 05-1429, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company versus Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Mr. Brunstad.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37156 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit's Fobian rule creates an unwarranted Federal common law rule that exists outside the structure of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Code has a distinct structure. For example, if a debtor has a right to an attorneys' fees valid under State law, after the petition date, the date the debtor files for bankruptcy, that right passes to the bankruptcy estate. If a creditor has a State law right to attorneys' fees, after the petition date, that right becomes a claim in bankruptcy. The Ninth Circuit's Fobian rule intercepts those rights even before we get to what the Bankruptcy Code provides or does to them and basically says, if you're litigating Federal issues, you simply cannot have a right to attorneys' fees unless the Federal law authorizes that right, in this case, contractual rights, or alternatively rights available under State statute. That, we submit, is an impermissible creation of a Federal common law rule. There is no basis for it under this Court's preemption precedents. There's no conflict between Federal policy and State policy which would justify the creation of the rule, and accordingly, it is unwarranted.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can you tell me -- this is just basic bankruptcy. I should know, but I looked it up and couldn't find it. A standard promissory note which provides for attorneys' fees, the holder of the note is the creditor, the maker of the note is the bankrupt -- the maker of the note goes bankrupt. The holder of the note gets his attorney and says: File a claim in bankruptcy. And the attorney sends him a bill. Is the attorneys' fees, the attorney fee for filing the bankruptcy claim, recoverable as part of the claim?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It depends, Justice Kennedy. It depends on what their contractual right provides. Here we have a contractual --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's the standard, it's the standard attorneys' fee provision, all attorneys' fees in connection with collection of this note and enforcement of the terms of this note.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then, yes, Justice Kennedy, I would say it probably would be covered. It probably would be covered and the analysis --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is there something where I can look that up in Collier? Are there millions of cases? I mean, this seems to me fairly rudimentary.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Kennedy. In our reply brief, we do cite to Collier, where we talk about exactly that scenario and it is described. And it basically works like this. A claim under the Bankruptcy Code is defined under Section 1015. The claim includes any right to payment whether it's contingent or fixed, matured, unmatured, et cetera. Any right to payment, literally any right to payment, when the debtor files for bankruptcy, that becomes a claim. If the right --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. But in my case, it's a post-petition action.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Kennedy. The key concept -- and this is explained clearly in Collier -- is where does the right come from? If it arises out of a pre-petition contract, then the right is pre-petition in nature, even though the fees are incurred post-petition. Think of a guarantee. Think of if PG&E had guaranteed its parent's debt for the $100 million, let's say.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could you just back up just for a second? Supposing at the time of the bankruptcy that the services have not been performed. It's post-petition conduct by the lawyer.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, in that case, are you saying that routinely the lawyer recovers fees in the bankruptcy case even if the debtor, the debtor was insolvent? And we're assuming insolvency in the hypothetical, although it may not fit this case.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Exactly, yes, Justice Stevens, if in fact, though, the creditor bothers to assert the claim for fees in the bankruptcy case. In most cases, creditors don't, because it's not worth the effort of asserting the claim for fees subsequently. In cases such as this, where you have a solvent debtor who can pay all claims in full, there's no reason why they should be able to get out of their contractual obligations in bankruptcy.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, why wouldn't it be worth -- I know here. But why wouldn't it be worth the effort, instead of getting $90 on the note, to get 95?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, because there's a transaction cost in actually filing the additional claim setting forth the amount that you've incurred. In most cases, Justice Stevens, creditors don't even hire attorneys to pursue or file a claim in bankruptcy. In most Chapter 7 cases, for example, they are no-asset cases.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are you telling me just based on your experience that in Justice Kennedy's hypothetical, normally, no fees are recovered?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Normally, there's no distribution on unsecured claims in most bankruptcy cases. So why bother?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But assuming in those cases where there's some distribution, is it correct, as I'm assuming your answer to Justice Kennedy's question, that the normal practice is you don't bother because there is not enough involved?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Typically, Justice Stevens, that is correct. But in cases such as this, where the attorneys' fees are substantial, the debtor is solvent, and there are substantial --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Just in the hypothetical, I would think that in many cases, there's going to be some payout for the promissory note, and the holder of the note tells his attorneys: Make sure I get that claim in bankruptcy. The attorney files a claim. And every attorney that files a claim for a promissory note which is entitled to a fee from the bankruptcy court for filing in the bankruptcy court.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ For the work done in performing, filing the proof of claim, that's correct. And even though, Justice Kennedy, the attorney's conduct was after the debtor filed for bankruptcy, the right to payment arises out of the pre-petition contract. Again, think of the guarantee hypothetical. There you had the --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The pre-petition contract, but not out of pre-petition conduct.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Justice Stevens. But just think about the pre-petition tort claim, where there has been exposure to asbestos products pre-petition, but the injury arises post-petition. It's still a pre-petition claim.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, but you're one step ahead of that here, because here there hasn't been any, in effect, any exposure. Here there isn't any certain default on the note. So far as we know, here, there may never be any default on the workers comp obligation. So that your contingency is a much more remote contingency. Why should that, why should this case fall into the same category as the promissory note?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Souter, it's different in this sense. This is an indemnity, all-loss indemnity provision. The surety is not supposed to incur any loss, any cost whatsoever, for supplying these surety bonds to PG&E.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And so far as we know, it won't.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it has, because when PG&E filed for bankruptcy --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it has, but that depends on a totally circular argument. The minute it filed for bankruptcy, although there had been no default on the comp obligation, your client started incurring attorneys' fees, and it was not incurring attorneys' fees based on any default by the, by the debtor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Souter, you can visualize bankruptcy itself as being a default. When the debtor files for bankruptcy, you must come to the bankruptcy court to present your rights --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You can call bankruptcy a default, but that's not what I mean, and you know that's not what I mean. I'm talking about a default on the workers comp obligation.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There has been no default on the workers comp obligation, and because they intend to keep on running this business, there is reason to suppose that there will not be.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, by analogy, Justice Souter, in the LTV case, the same posture at the beginning of the case. We don't know what's going to happen in the future. You must file your claim at the beginning of the case. In LTV --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, and maybe you don't have a claim at the beginning of the case. I mean, that's what we're getting at. We can understand the claim when the note -- when you've got a promissory note and you're out of money. The claim is inevitable. In this case, there is no inevitable claim.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's precisely the point of why claim is defined so broadly to include contingent claims.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if it is defined as broadly as this, we're in a situation exactly like this. There has been no default on the obligation, and prior to getting to this Court, $167,000 has been racked up in legal fees that accomplishes absolutely nothing.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely false, Justice Souter. In bankruptcy, if you do not present your rights, if the rights of the workers themselves are not properly treated, they are lost. Under Section 1141, they are extinguished.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right, in this case, $167,000 has been spent to come to the conclusion, as I understand it. That if the time comes to assert a right of indemnification, you can assert a right of indemnification and we can oppose it. If we are going to construe the bankruptcy law to provide a law like this, then maybe there is something wrong in the, in the construction of the bankruptcy law.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Souter, because if you look at what Section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code does, it provides that a plan of reorganization binds all parties. If you're not provided for adequately in the plan under Section 1141(d), your rights are extinguished forever. You must come to the bankruptcy court; you must be sure that the rights are properly characterized. Excuse me.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's not what this bankruptcy court thought about the claim. This bankruptcy court said some rather critical things.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Ginsburg, but I think we need to distinguish two different things. There was the work that was performed in preserving the rights of the injured employees, to make sure they were properly classified, that their rights were rendered unimpaired. If that hadn't been in the plan, then their rights would have been extinguished under Section 1141. Then there was the claim that the surety provides for having had to have done all of that work.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I don't -- there was never a time that the plan said we are not going to pay our workers' compensation.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The problem, Justice Ginsburg, is that the plan said nothing at all. And when the plan says nothing at all, the default rule in bankruptcy is that rights are extinguished; they are discharged under Section 1141(d). It must be in the plan in order to be invalid after the confirmation of the plan. We had to assure those rights were properly treated in the plan, because if they weren't, they would have been discharged under the general -- general discharge provision. That is why one must come to the bankruptcy court, one must file a proof of claim, one must enforce your rights in bankruptcy; if you don't, you lose them. That's why the surety here stepped forward, said it has subrogation rights; the workers have rights. And the bankruptcy court agreed with Travelers. It directed the debtor to put that language in the plan. Travelers --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought there was a section of the code that preserved subrogation rights.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's Section 509, Justice Ginsburg.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's not what I was speaking of just momentarily. The rights of the injured employees, the workers, when they filed for -- when PG&E filed for bankruptcy, the injured workers had claims. They were going to receive periodic benefit payments off into the future. If PG&E had not properly provided for those claims in the bankruptcy case in their plan, those claims would have been extinguished. As a result, though, Travelers would not have been off the hook on its surety bond, Travelers would have had to have stepped forward and make the payments if PG&E did not. But if Travelers hadn't come to the bankruptcy court and said, these are our rights, these need to be preserved, its recourse against PG&E would have extinguished as well. If one does not come to the bankruptcy court and assert one's rights, one loses them. And of course, creditors when they do have to assert their rights, incur attorneys' fees for doing so. And here we had a pre-petition contract that said, whatever loss we incur, including attorneys' fees, we have a right to recover, a right to payment. That becomes the claim.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let's assume, let's assume that one of the recipients of comp payments had come forward and said: I object to the plan, I have a claim for comp payments and I object to the plan because it doesn't provide for them. And the -- the court said, you're, you're right. The plan is going to include provision for comp payments and it had been so amended, and it was then -- the plan was then amended. Would you, under those circumstances, have had any -- would Travelers, under those circumstances, have had any reason to assert a claim?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We would not have done that work. No, Justice Souter, because the injured worker him or herself would have done it.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I know it. But would you have had any other claim that you would have asserted, had that been done?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, with respect to the, the treatment of the workers under the plan, no. With respect to --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With respect to any interest of Travelers?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Souter.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If that had been done, would Travelers have asserted a claim?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Souter.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We would have said, in our proof of claim, as we did: If we must make payment in the future, we are entitled to two things. One, we are entitled to reimbursement from PG&E for any amount that we must spend in the future whenever that might occur. Two, if we have to pay any of the employees, we are subrogated. We stand in the shoes of the employees and may assert those rights. The subrogation right would have been fully protected, though, Justice Souter, because of the treatment of the workers in the plan rendering them unimpaired. We would have left simply -- with simply saying we have these reimbursement rights which we would have in case we have to make payment. Now, in the LTV case, which we cite in our papers, at the beginning of the LTV case, the surety who has had $40 million in surety bonds was in a position, very much the same as in this case, when PG&E filed. PG&E got an order authorizing it to continue to pay but not requiring it to pay. That can only be done in the plan of reorganization. LTV started paying the workers' comp benefits, but then defaulted and stopped, long after the bankruptcy case had commenced, but far short of when it concluded. The surety had to step up to the plate and make the payments. If the surety had not filed a proof of claim at the beginning of the case, the surety would have lost its recourse against the debtor, LTV, even though it subsequently, far later, had to make payment.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct me if I'm wrong --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's how bankruptcy works.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In -- in this case, I thought that if a contingency claim for indemnification is not allowed, but if it becomes fixed at some time, then the claim can be made and is not lost.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Ginsburg. There is a bar date set in the beginning of Chapter 11 cases. You must file your claim by the bar date or you'll be forever barred, even if your liability becomes fixed later.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm talking about 502(e)(1).
05-1429 +++$+++ 37218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Ginsburg, if your reimbursement claim is contingent, it will be disallowed, subject to reconsideration under Section 502(j). And that's what the parties stipulated to in this case in our stipulation. We filed our proof of claim, then PG&E objected to our proof of claim, but Justice Ginsburg, PG&E did a lot more than just object to our contingent reimbursement rights. They mischaracterized our subrogation rights as claims; they sought to disallow our subrogation claims; and they sought to subordinate our claims. Plus in addition, they sought to disallow the claims of the injured workers. So we had to respond to the litigation that was commenced. We had to defend our rights, and we were successful. The workers' claims were ultimately left unimpaired in the bankruptcy as they should have been. PG&E was fully responsible for paying the workers' claims.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In any case, this has nothing to do with the, Fobian, so-called Fobian issue, whether the Ninth Circuit drew the bright line.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct, Justice Ginsburg. The Fobian rule, we submit, is an impermissible creation of Federal common law. It's not justified by any concept of preemption; there is no conflict with bankruptcy policy --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are they --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Question --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me just ask you about the Fobian, and I know Justice Breyer has a question. Let's assume that you're correct in that the fees are allowable. Can the bankruptcy court make the determination of the reasonableness of the fees?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It depends, Justice Kennedy. If State law, if it's an unsecured claim under Section 501(b)(1) --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In this case.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In this case, that would be a determination under State law. Every State, Your Honor, has a reasonableness requirement.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so if the bankruptcy judge isn't sure of what the amount is, he looks to State law to determine the amount?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Kennedy. Under Section 501(b)(1) --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the bankruptcy court does determine reasonableness.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAHONEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If State law provides for it, and all States do. The bankruptcy court adopts the State reasonableness standard for unsecured claims under Section 502(b)(1). Yes, Justice Breyer?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sort of back where Justice Kennedy started on this. Forget -- I'd like to forget your case, because your case seems to me to be a case where parties argue reasonably about whether the contract itself covers this kind of fee. And maybe it doesn't, if it's very unreasonable, et cetera. But let's take a very straightforward case. It's an obvious contract to collect a debt, or maybe a mortgage, and in the debt or the mortgage agreement, it says, attorneys' fees will be paid for collection. It clearly covers bankruptcy, too, by its language. And now there must be many instances or some, anyway, where the security is inadequate.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The security --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And there must be other instances in which there wasn't any security. And if I read Collier as you pointed to, that seems to say, in such cases, very simple, the creditor has the status of an unsecured creditor in respect to those attorneys' fees.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And in --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Overage in the secured case, and the whole claim in the unsecured case. So get in the queue and you can collect your pro-rata share.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Justice Breyer.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ My question is, I have 19 professors on the other side coming to tell me that that's never happened. They can't even find an instance. So it isn't as if, it isn't as if you haven't found an instance, it is that they are prepared to say it never happened. And then there may be one exception or two or something like that. And I can't, that -- I'm now totally puzzled. Because if it's so clear as you say, and I follow your logic, and I followed Collier, why? After all, there are bankrupt people who do have some assets. Explain it.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer it happens all the time. In our brief, we cite to many, many cases in which attorneys' fees are allowed as unsecured claims. It's actually been happening for over 100 years, it happened in the Bankruptcy Act of 1998.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no. But -- but we are talking about attorneys' fees for services performed in the bankruptcy proceeding?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct, Your Honor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The cost of filing the claim, the cost of talking to the bankruptcy judge, et cetera.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct, Your Honor. And in a key case we cited, the Second Circuit's decision, United Manufacturers and Merchants, where they didn't even hire an attorney until after the bankruptcy case was filed, the attorney performed services, filing a proof of claim, protecting the equitable rights, and the Second Circuit clearly held that those attorneys' fees were properly part of the unsecured claim, but it couldn't be any clearer. And the Second Circuit --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what I don't -- there is a body of law on the other side of that issue, too, isn't there?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is, Justice Stevens, but those are lower court decisions.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Absolutely. The Second Circuit is a lower court.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, compared to this Court, certainly, Justice Stevens.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly right. There are no cases from this Court speaking to this precise issue, are there? On which there is a disagreement among the lower courts?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, I think it's important to say that the alternative rule that PG&E asked for is one that every court of appeals to have addressed has rejected. What they are saying is, oh, you can't get your attorneys' fees based on a construction of the Bankruptcy Code. No court of appeals has accepted it. There are some lower bankruptcy court decisions that have accepted it, but that is routinely overturned on appeal. The issue of whether you get your attorneys' fees as part of an unsecured claim, Cohen versus De La Cruz, in that case this Court had to construe whether the term debt, which means under the Bankruptcy Code the same thing as a claim, is defined as liability on a claim, there the Court, this Court concluded that that debt included attorneys' fees, the treble damages, the whole nine yards.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You would have thought that the one group of people who ought to know this thoroughly, or at least have a view are the bankruptcy bar.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And, and yet there are no briefs from them; there are not -- there is no article that I could find in Bankruptcy Journal.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there may be no briefs from them because it isn't the question on which we granted cert, is it?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Chief Justice Roberts, that's correct. And our view is that the Court should deal only with the Fobian rule. And the alternative argument which Respondent presented was never argued below, was not decided below, was not presented in the opposition to certiorari. It's been rejected by every single court of appeals --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it would be proper to remand for the Ninth Circuit to consider those other arguments?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Ginsburg. And that's exactly what this Court should do. It should remand their statutory interpretation argument to the Court of Appeals to consider, for the lower courts to consider. This Court deserves more than just a 20-page reply brief in response to 80 pages of briefing by the other side on an issue that was never raised below, not presented in the opposition to certiorari. Remand would be the proper thing to do with respect to their claim. I do believe that is true, Justice Ginsburg.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ On both their statutory interpretation and the contract?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The contract, reasonableness, all of those issues. The circuit split, which we presented to the Court, and which I understand certiorari was -- well, I'm guessing -- certiorari was granted on, it deals with the Fobian rule. As this common law rule, this sort of construct, that if you're litigating Federal law issues, well, as a matter of general Federal common law, you can't get the attorneys' fees unless it's authorized by Federal law. And our brief was entirely devoted to that. You can't justify that rule in our view under preemption principles; there's no conflict; there is no Congress preempting the field in any way; you can't justify this under Atherton as a, as a -- something that's necessary because of a conflict with Federal policy. And also the Fobian rule is inappropriately categorical, in violation of what we submit are these Court's principles in the Nolan case, in the CF and I case. In those cases, the Court said: It's not for the courts to create these claims processing rules in bankruptcy. But that exactly is what the Ninth Circuit did here. If there are no further questions I'd like to reserve the balance of my time for rebuttal.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ One quick question, if I may. Would one of the issues open on remand be the construction of the contract? Is there an issue at State law as to whether Travelers pays for these particular services?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Stevens. That would be appropriate on remand. I reserve the balance of my time.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Counsel.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Rosenkranz.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37264 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Let me begin at the threshold, on whether this Court should consider the statutory construction argument that we've presented. The issue of statutory --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And can we be, take one step before that and tell us if you are conceding that the Fobian rule has no basis in the statute and is wrong?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, the Fobian rule reaches the correct conclusion in this case, but Your Honor is correct. The problem with the Fobian rule is that it doesn't go far enough in presenting, in preventing creditors from requiring other creditors to pay for their attorneys' fees.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if you say it doesn't go far enough then I infer from that you say that it's valid as far as it goes?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is valid as far as it covers this case but not on the rationale of the Ninth Circuit. In other words, the Ninth Circuit did begin in the wrong place, which was not to read the statute, Section 502, which is why that is a rational predicate to the issue that Travelers is presenting here.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not sure I agree, Counsel, that the Fobian rule is both narrower and broader than the question you try to present. For example it applies to the claims of a secured creditor for attorneys fees on a secured claim as well.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why -- it doesn't?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Mr. Chief Justice. No court has ever held that the Fobian rule applies to oversecured creditors. Everyone acknowledges that Section 506(b) applies to oversecured creditors so.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So if you're an oversecured creditor with a claim for attorneys' fees arising under solely issues of matters of Federal bankruptcy law, the Fobian rule doesn't prevent that?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. Everyone is absolutely clear that Fobian to the extent that it applies --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, not everyone. I'm not clear on it.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry, Your Honor. All the bankruptcy practitioners and courts are clear that to the extent that Fobian applies, it applies only to unsecured creditors. But again this is a rational predicate to this Court's analysis of Fobian. How do we know?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If it is a rational predicate, we might have expected to hear about it in the opposition to certiorari.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. I apologize for focusing only on the issue that Travelers was focusing on, which was whether this was, whether the Fobian rule was itself cert-worthy question. But it is a rational predicate because, as you can see from Travelers' brief, Travelers says no fewer than a dozen times, including in two point headings: Read the code; read the code. It will tell you that unsecured creditors have an allowable claim for post-petition attorneys' fees, and only if you begin by reading the code can you figure out whether the Fobian common law overlay is correct or not. So when we say, Your Honors, yes, let's read the code, that's not an ambush and that is not smuggling in.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it's an ambush and it is smuggling in the sense we don't have a court of appeals decision one way or the other on that question, do we?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, we do have court of appeals decisions on this precise question, not in this case because the court of appeals had Fobian and the rule that underlay Fobian for 20 years. But there are three courts of appeals --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg has a question I'm very interested in. Do you defend the Fobian rule?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do not, Your Honor. The Fobian rule is wrong at least, especially as to the distinction that it draws between State law and Federal litigation. There's only one answer to the question --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, why then isn't the proper disposition of this case to send it back to the Ninth Circuit to consider all these other arguments?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, because this issue has been fully ventilated among the lower courts.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but we are not a court of first view and you know that very well. We are a court of review. So no matter how well it's been aired, we wait to see what the lower courts have said on a question. We don't take it in the first instance.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, I understand that, Your Honor. It would have been futile to argue this before the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit would have said that --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understand that because they have the Fobian rule.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. Now, but, Your Honor, let me just add two additional reasons why this Court should consider it now. The first is this has been fully ventilated in the lower courts. There is not a single argument in the briefs on either side on which there is not a lower court opinion going one way or another on every argument. Secondly, there is an enormous amount of affirmative harm that can come from this Court simply saying, let us conclude that the Ninth Circuit was wrong in disallowing these claims on the logic that the Ninth Circuit followed, but we will reserve for a later day an open question of law on what Section 502(b) and 506(b) means. And the harm comes from the fact that overwhelmingly the lower courts in the last 10 years have concluded that 502(b) and 506(b) mean that unsecured creditors do not have these claims. If this Court declares that it is now an open question --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me ask you a question about that. Your argument depends -- you analogize -- you would agree, I take it, that if this was an oversecured, secured creditor they'd be entitled to fees?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, we would dispute the contractual interpretation, but yes, Your Honor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But assuming, assuming the contract provides that.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if that's true -- and the reason for that I suppose is that doesn't impair the rights of the general creditors at all.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's one logic of the --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that's so, why isn't their argument that, well, your client is solvent, the complete answer to your position?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHORR +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, because Congress didn't say that. Congress gave only one answer to the question whether unsecured creditors get their attorneys' fees allowed, that is post-petition attorneys' fees allowed. It's either yes or no. There is no on-off switch for solvent or insolvent creditors within the code, which is why Travelers never argued that as a, an objection to the plan of confirmation.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They argue it in their reply brief here.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, and that is absolutely incorrect. If you look at the case that they cite, that case relies on a provision of the code, which is Section 726. And Section 726 is only about post-petition interest for solvent debtors, not post-petition attorneys' fees.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, how do you avoid -- what about their statement from Collier?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37300 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, the statement that Travelers quotes from Collier is about a proposition that we don't dispute, which is whether it is a pre-petition claim. But Collier.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37301 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. No. It said -- a pre-petition claim, if a creditor incurs the attorneys' fees post-petition, they incur it post-petition, afterwards they file, after the petition they file a claim with the bankruptcy court, in exercising or protecting a pre-petition claim that included a right to recover attorneys' fees. And they say that's what we have, we had a contract that gave us this right to attorneys' fees. The fees will be pre- petitioned in nature, constituting a contingent pre-petition obligation that became fixed post-petition when the fees were incurred. All right. Now, what is your response to that?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, my response is I urge you, Justice Breyer, to look back at Colliers, because that is absolutely accurate and it doesn't apply to this case.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because, Your Honor, that is a statement about whether it is a pre-petition claim, not about whether the claim is allowable or not, which is what we are arguing about.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then you explain that to me?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. Step one is, is it a claim. No one disputes that this is a claim. It is a right to payment. Step two, is this an allowable claim? The answer under the code is absolutely not, because the code says there is only one class of creditors that gets their attorneys' fees claims allowed and that is oversecured creditors and so --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's because 506 had to do that in order to tell the bankruptcy courts how to deal with secured claims.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That doesn't -- and then you have the negative inference or the exclusio unius argument, whatever, which I think is misplaced in this context.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, Congress put 506(b) in the code for one purpose and one purpose only, and that was to allow claims that are not elsewhere allowed, because if it doesn't do that 506(b) serves no purpose at all. 506(b) says nothing at all about whether the claim is secured.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why doesn't it serve the purpose of saying that the fees will be covered by the security? They'll not be just be claims for fees that would stand together with the unsecured creditors, but that the oversecured -- the security will cover the interest, will cover the attorneys' fees, and that's the function of 506 whatever --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, the answer is 506(b) does not say anything about whether the allowed claim is secured or not. It is completely silent about that. Now, if we accept, as we explain in our brief in much more detail, if we accept Travelers' argument that it was an allowed claim in the first instance and it is therefore furthermore an allowed security claim, 506(a) tells you what to do with that. 506(a) tells us that an allowed claim to a secured creditor is a secured claim. It still leaves Section 506(b) with nothing left to do. Now, let me just back up and underscore: Any creditor would love to get the other creditors to pay its attorneys' fees. Tort claimants would love it, trade creditors would love it, local tax collectors would love it. But Congress said only one category of claimants get to claim their post-petition attorneys' fees.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course, that is exactly what's puzzling me. But why haven't they gone out and got? So why -- what you're pointing to so far is that Congress has said a particular class of people get the attorneys' fees out of the security insofar as the security will support it. It doesn't say a word about what happens to the attorneys' fees after the security is exhausted, nor about anybody else's attorneys' fees, where so provided by contract. Colliers says they can get it.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, Congress said --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Same puzzlement.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, Congress has said no such thing. What Congress says is that an allowed claim is allowed as of the date of the filing of the petition. That is when you value the claim and you value the claim as of the date of the filing of the petition. At that point, it is worth zero because no post-petition attorneys' fees have been incurred. And the fact of the matter is it may well have never occurred to the drafters of the code when --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Suppose I sell you a house and I make a promise that I'll fix any leaks in the bathroom. And lo and behold, before there's a leak the -- I'm bankrupt. And while I'm bankrupt it floods, the bathroom. No claim?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, that is a claim. It is a --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is a contingent claim. And you're saying this is the same.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm saying -- they are saying this is a contingent claim. If -- and it is a very strange sort of a contingency. It is Travelers saying, we have a claim, it is a contingent claim; the contingency is whether tomorrow morning we're going to pick up the phone and called Weil Gotshal to monitor the bankruptcy proceeding. But let's assume it is a contingent claim. It is still a disallowed claim and Congress provided numerous statutory indications that it was. I already mentioned 506(b) but there are more. Congress said that attorneys' fees are available only, quote, "to the extent that a claim is oversecured." Now that would be a very --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. It's quite unlike the situation, for example in Timbers, where had you in 502 a disallowance of post-petition interest. There is not in 502 a disallowance of attorneys' fees.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I was just going to get there. Timbers underscores this proposition. Timbers focused on the structure of 506 and it began with and it underscored, the only words that it underscored were, "to the extent that." But let me turn to that.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Timbers cited, as the Chief Justice indicates, the interest section in 506. That's all it's about. I don't -- I think Timbers is misleading on this point.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, Timbers has the structural argument that focuses on what the purpose of 506(b) is. But there are more indications. It would be odd for Congress, for example, to draft this provision 506(b) that purports to put post-petition attorneys' fees on the same footing at post-petition interest if it intended to put them on different footings. It's an observation this Court made in Ron Pair. Moreover, Congress was not oblivious to the existence of attorneys' fees post-petition. There are 15 occasions in the code where Congress spoke to attorneys' fees and if Congress had intended attorneys' fees to be available to this enormous class of unsecured creditors, one would think that it would not have hidden that in the definition of "claim" --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, are those 15 places -- do they involve attorneys' fees as administrative expenses? Do any of them involve attorneys' fees simply as an unsecured claim for attorneys' fees?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, as to creditors, four of them apply to attorneys' fees as administrative expenses. It's a very important point because the code says and it adopts this age old rule that if you are going to take money away from some unsecured creditors and give it to attorneys it better be because you're expanding the pot for all of the other creditors.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's the answer to my question? Is the answer that 11 of them say you can collect attorneys' fees, but only as an unsecured claim against creditors.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, for the, for creditors there are only six that apply. Four of them are the administrative.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right, so six.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So six are administrative, and then the remaining two say that the creditor can collect it as an unsecured debt?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which are those two?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, one of them does.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which is that?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is the provision that Travelers cites -- and I apologize it's not in any of the appendices -- 502(b)(4). And 502(b)(4) underscores our point. 502(b)(4) says, and I'm quoting directly from the code: "A claim is allowed to the" -- "is disallowed to the extent that," and then "(4) if such claim is for services of an insider or attorney and such claim exceeds the reasonable value of such services." That is focused on pre-petition activities of the lawyers on behalf of the debtor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37337 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That seems to cut the other way because it says it's disallowed insofar as it's unreasonable of course, and therefore it would be allowed insofar as it's reasonable.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37338 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, yes. Pre-petition claims for services provided by an attorney before for the petition.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, attorney for the debtor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ An attorney for the debtor and, Your Honor, the code is clear it's noteworthy.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but I mean you don't have exactly what I was driving to. I was quite interested that you said there are 11 other provisions that we could look at for support, and I wouldn't think it was support if those consider -- concern administrative expenses, which nobody's asking for here, they just want an unsecured claim, or if they concern some other --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37342 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Fair enough Your Honor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37343 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- irrelevant thing.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37344 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Fair enough, Your Honor. My point is that Congress knew about attorneys' fees and if it wanted this huge class of unsecured creditors to collect their attorneys' fees for post-petition activities, it wouldn't have hidden that in a general definition of claim or in the general statement of allowability.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37345 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Counsel, your brother in his reply brief said that no court of appeals has endorsed your theory, and I -- earlier you told me one had. Which one in particular?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, the First Circuit -- there are three courts of appeals that have addressed the question, all in dictum but in very extensive dictum. So the First Circuit comes out our way in Adams versus Zimmerman. The Second Circuit comes out also in dictum on Travelers' side in United Merchants. And then the Sixth Circuit splits the baby in half, or reads the code all the way up to our position as we do, and then takes a detour in another direction.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you really want us to reach out and decide a question that's not presented when there has been no holding of the court of appeals one way or the other on the issue?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, we didn't come here asking this Court to address this question. Travelers put it front and center. They conceded --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you thought the Fobian rule was wrong, you could have said that.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, it would have made no sense for us to argue that Fobian was wrong when we were trying to defend the judgment below. But I concede, Your Honor, this Court has discretion to decide whether it's going to address what we believe is an absolute factual predicate, and what Travelers seems -- I'm sorry, legal predicate -- and what Travelers seems to believe is a legal predicate, which is why we're saying to the Court this case, this issue has been ventilating for 20 years, and a lot of mischief can be --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How -- can we decide? But I'm wondering about, maybe you don't want to answer this, but I mean, if we were to say Fobian is wrong, everybody will agree with us. But we should have to say why it's wrong. And if we say the reason that it's wrong is because you can't collect attorneys' fees at all, you'll be delighted. And if we say the reason it's wrong is because you can collect attorneys' fees regardless, they'll be delighted. And our only other alternative is to not say why it's wrong or -- I mean, that's the problem.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's exactly --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's an added complication. There's another case on which the Ninth Circuit's based its decision in your case, DeRoche. Your proposed solution here doesn't address the issue in DeRoche because there it's the debtor that's seeking attorneys' fees.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So we still have to decide the Fobian issue. And your failure to defend it here means that we're going to have to decide in on that inadequate record. If you have mentioned that in an opposition to certiorari, perhaps we would have granted cert in the DeRoche case and had an argument about the rule that we have to decide.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I appreciate that, and I apologize for not having raised it in the cert petition, cert opposition, we were simply focused on why it is that this little sliver of the Fobian rule was not worth this Court's attention. But I understand that this Court needs to look forward and try and figure out what exactly the issues are that are presented. I only add that the statutory question that is presented in DeRoche and in this case are as Your Honor has pointed out, mirror images of each other. So whatever this Court decides as to the statutory construction question on 502(b), this Court can say it's not resolving Fobian because this is a predicate question. And this Court can say there may well be circumstances in which a creditor can say, you know what, for State law litigation we have this common law right, and we reserve for a later day the question of whether there is an exception to the statutory rule that we are articulating. Now I want to underscore that Congress had very important reasons that are built into the code for coming out this way and disallowing unsecured creditors attorneys' fees. Bear in mind that these sorts of fee shifting provisions are absolutely ubiquitous. They are in every credit card contract. They are in every bank loan. They are in virtually any written contract, and when a contract doesn't provide for it, quite often State law statutes do. Allowing all of these unsecured creditors to pay their lawyers out of the hides of all of the other unsecured creditors --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but that's not the facts of this case. Isn't that correct?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This will not have any adverse, if I understand the facts, any adverse impact whatsoever on any unsecured creditor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, on the facts of this case if the rule had been otherwise, we don't know whether PG&E would have been solvent at all. But we are arguing about a rule that is not one rule for Travelers and one rule for everyone else. We are arguing about a rule for the vast majority of cases.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but just looking at this case itself, if there is plenty of money there to pay a State law obligation, why shouldn't just ordinary rules of contract law apply?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, the answer is, Congress dealt with this issue and decided that no one gets to get in line and get their attorneys' fees, regardless of whether they're solvent or not. It's a --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're raising a provision that says just that, it's the absence of a provision for attorneys' fees that you're relying on.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, no, Your Honor. We've been talking about why the only natural way to read the code is to disallow attorneys' fees, and I'm explaining that if attorneys' fees are generally disallowed to everyone, there's no exception to that rule in the code that says ah, yes, but if there's an insolvent -- if there's a solvent debtor, the rule is otherwise.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where is the provision that generally disallows attorneys' fees?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. What I'm saying is 502(b) when you read "as of the time of the filing of the petition," it says -- that means, that must mean that it doesn't apply to post-petition attorneys' fees, especially when you look at 502(b) through the lens, as this Court did in Timbers, of the rest of the code. 506(b), all of these other attorneys' fees --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, on that point you disagree with the Collier citation at page 9 of the reply brief then?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, I disagree with Colliers, but I don't think Colliers comes out one way or another on this particular question. That was the same question that was asked earlier about whether it's a claim, whether it's a pre-petition claim.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it says if the creditor incurs the attorneys' fees post petition in connection with protecting a pre-petition claim --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the fees will be pre-petition.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That was the same --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you disagree with that?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37374 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't disagree with that, Your Honor. I was referring to another provision of Colliers, not the one that's cited in the reply brief. That is a correct statement but it has no application here because we are not arguing about whether it's a pre-petition obligation. Of course it's a pre-petition obligation. Just like pre-petition interest -- excuse me -- post-petition interest is a pre-petition obligation we are arguing that the code cancels that obligation because there are very important reasons, such as equality among all unsecured creditors, the --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37375 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're saying this particular set of pre-petition obligations. Collier, I think in context must be saying, you get paid the money. I mean, he goes on in the next sentence and says by the way, despite my last sentence, you don't get the money?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37376 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. What Colliers is talking about is a completely different question. He doesn't answer that question one way or another in Colliers.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, in other words what he implies, if I ready the whole page I'll see, although he just said what we quoted, the whole page means, by the way, I'm not telling you if you get the money or not?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This was a completely different discussion on a --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sorry, I'll --
05-1429 +++$+++ 37380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- completely different section referring to setoffs.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think your 506(b) argument, I see your point, I see your point, is there -- I mean, and you'd have to say well, 506(b) simply repeats 506(a), as sometimes provisions do, and then it becomes somewhat superfluous, somewhat not. I got that point. I also have your point about, well, there are other references. Now, is there any other point in the code?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. There is one other point and that is, 502(c) tells the court what it is supposed to do with contingent claims. It is supposed to either liquidate them or estimate them. These are -- this is a very strange sort of contingency, as I mentioned earlier.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not in the materials, 502(c)?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ 502(c) is, Your Honor. It's on the very back of the cert petition appendix on page, I believe 28. And so it says either estimate or liquidate, but always as of the date of the filing of the petition. Now as of the date of the filing of the petition it would be impossible to estimate without a crystal ball.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How do they do it with my leaky bathroom?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, what you do is -- that is a classic contingency. What you do is to estimate the likelihood that the bathroom will in fact leak and the cost of those expenses, and you put something into the, into the bankruptcy estate for that purpose. That would be something that Congress would never have wanted to do with thousands and thousands of unsecured creditors.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I am concerned about your point that there are all kinds of attorneys' fees contracts out there and if everybody can get fees for filing the claim post-petition act, we have a huge amount of claims to pay. Travelers would tell us, though, that a surety is different, that they somehow stand in the shoes of PG&E or something.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't understand why a surety is different from any other contract. All contractual creditors will want their fees. The reason that they haven't been applying for them is that the overwhelming majority of bankruptcy courts will tell you no, you can't have them, because the overwhelming majority of cases have been saying exactly what I'm saying to you. 502(b) does not allow them, and we can tell that by looking at 506(b). And there are other reasons that Congress would not have wanted to do that. It would have burdened the administration of the state -- of the estate. The court would be spending more time administering claims about fees and what does this contract mean, and fees upon fees upon fees, than it would be spending administering the basic bankruptcy estate.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, of course the argument here is that this is something different from the general abuse that you're describing, because the plan didn't make any provision here for, for paying the workers comp obligation at all. What is your response to that?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, my response is that is absolutely wrong. The first draft of the plan which you can see on page 28 of the appendix says explicitly, and I quote, "all workers compensation programs are treated as executory contract." Treated as executory contracts and deemed assumed by the debtor, and that means that the workers got the most favorable treatment that they could have gotten. These are not just unsecured claims.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your friend says it's more favorable to say the claims are unimpaired.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. ROSENKRANZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, that's what they argued. The bankruptcy court explicitly held otherwise and the Ninth Circuit agreed with the bankruptcy court. The bankruptcy court said, none of your interventions were reasonably necessary to reach -- excuse me -- to advance your interests. Therefore, you are absolutely wrong when you argue to us that you are on the State law side of the Fobian rule. Now if you ask me, Your Honor, where in the bankruptcy court decision does it say that, I would refer the Court to page 24a of the -- of the cert petition appendix, where you see asterisks for a missing paragraph right in the middle of the opinion. That, and just to orient the Court, we're looking at the first paragraph that says first of all. Then there's a -- there is an asterisk eliminating a paragraph. Look at page 140a, 141 of the joint appendix where the missing paragraph that Travelers eliminated is filled in, and there the court summarizes a 15-page colloquy with Travelers about why it is completely wrong in claiming that its steps were reasonably necessary. And on page 141, just to orient the Court again, you see that it begins, second paragraph, first of all. That's the same paragraph. The next paragraph refers to Mr. Brunstad's arguments. It says, "I just simply don't by it. I don't think you can sort of say, you know, we thought there was a thief hiding under the bed so we had to clear out under the bed. I don't think there was a risk there." And that was the gist of 15 pages proceeding the joint appendix, where the court methodically demolishes each of the argument Travelers presents here. Thank you, Your Honor.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Brunstad, you have eight minutes remaining.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37395 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer, in our brief on pages 25 and 26, we cite to a number of cases where the courts allowed attorneys' fees as an unsecured claim, both for pre-petition work done and also post-petition work done where the contractual right was pre-petitioned. We also cite a bunch of cases around page 44 -- 43 and 44 of our brief, including an article in the middle of page 44, quote: "In cases decided under the Bankruptcy Act, the higher courts consistently held that attorneys' fees were allowable even as unsecured claims in bankruptcy." Close quote. I've been a bankruptcy lawyer for over 20 years. I've been teaching bankruptcy law for 17 years. It is absolutely not true that courts routinely disallow claims for attorneys' fees as part of unsecured claims. It's the opposite is true it's routine that they are allowed in practical reality however they are not presented because creditors don't bother to present them because distributions are generally so low in bankruptcy. On the point about the plan completely protected the rights of the injured workers, nothing could be farther from the truth. The provision that counsel cites in the plan refers to exec, as executory contracts, workers' compensation benefit programs. Those are the contractual relationships between PG&E and its administrators, not the claims of the workers themselves. Tellingly, PG&E never argued in the bankruptcy court that the claims of the workers were fine under the plan. In fact, they said, we will do what Travelers wants after the bankruptcy court directed -- and it's in the transcript -- that that was the appropriate thing to do. In fact, what Travelers insisted is required by Section 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code, claims such as the workers' must be classified, their treatment must be specified. If they are not they are eliminated. The reference to executory contracts clearly doesn't apply. As we explain in our reply brief, the workers' claims were not executory contracts under applicable law. That section does not apply. Of course, I think, Chief Justice Roberts, there is a lot more that we would like to say about their alternative arguments than we were able to put in our 20-page reply brief. The issue that they raised has not been fully ventilated in the lower courts. In fact, there are many more things we would say about it on remand. I also think it's important to point out, Justice Stevens, they are a solvent debtor, and under the concept of absolute priority shareholders are not allowed to recover anything unless creditors are paid in full. What they are trying to do is they're trying to get rid of their contractual obligations in bankruptcy for the benefit of their shareholders. There's no implication between creditors, creditors' recoveries in this case one versus the other. In the Dow Corning case which we cite in our reply brief the Sixth Circuit expressly held where you have a solvent debtor you have to pay all of the attorneys' fees. That is an additional argument we would develop on remand. But all of their arguments about Section 506 and their interpretation of 502 simply don't matter, because as a solvent debtor they're not entitled to take advantage of that theory even if it were valid. And we contend that it isn't valid. The court of appeals have resoundingly rejected it. The Second Circuit rejected it in United Merchants and Manufacturers. The Sixth Circuit rejected it in Dow Corning. The Eleventh Circuit it en banc in the Wellsville case. All of them considered the 506 argument that they're making and rejected it, and properly so. Counsel cites to Section 502(b)(4). That's an important section because that demonstrates that Congress understood that attorneys' fees would be allowable as an unsecured claim under Section 502. And in Section 502(b)(4) it provided the only exception, the only one where attorneys' fees would not be allowable as an unsecured claim. It provided expressly attorneys' fees would not be allowable for the attorney for the debtor to the extent the claim for the fees exceeded the reasonable value of the services performed. Why is that provision there? Because Congress saw there was a problem. There was a problem of debtors sending money to their attorneys. Congress understood that to be a problem and it remedied it. Congress did not think there was a problem with respect to this historic practice of going on over 100 years of attorneys' fees being allowed as unsecured claims, and so in Section 502 it allows them. Respondents' argument about Section 506(b) renders Section 502(b)(4) superfluous. If attorneys' fees were never allowable as part of an unsecured claim except for how 506(b) allows it, then there would not be a need for Section 502(b)(4). In addition, Respondent overstates the office of Section 506. 506, as this Court explained in Ron Pair, provides, essentially tells us what secured creditors get out of their collateral and in what order -- the pre-petition amount and then, if there's any value left, the value of the collateral. After you pay the pre-petition amount of the claim, you can add attorneys' fees and you can add, post-petition you can add interest. Their interpretation of Section 506(b) would render Section 502(b)(2) superfluous. Under their theory, only oversecured creditors get post-petition interest, get interest.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37396 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you prevail, why can't every attorney who represents a creditor who has a credit card or a promissory note providing for attorneys' fees file something in bankruptcy and get attorneys' fees for the filing of the claim?
05-1429 +++$+++ 37397 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That already happens, Justice Kennedy. In all the circuits that recognize that attorneys' fees are allowed as unsecured claims, that already happens. And that has not cause any disaster or any problem. It's been a practice for 100 years. If Congress had wished to change the practice, it would have when it codified the Bankruptcy Code in 1979. The fact that it hasn't perceived it to be a problem demonstrates that Congress wanted to leave the practice unchanged. Now, what happens, though, again, Justice Kennedy, is that creditors don't bother to file claims for those amounts. And where it matters is in cases where it should matter, like in this case, in the PG&E case, where a solvent debtor is simply trying to get out of its contractual relationships. And under principles of absolute priority they are not allowed to do that for the benefit of shareholders where creditors are not being paid in full. And I think it's important to underscore again, Justice Kennedy.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's interesting. You're of course a teacher too. The amicus brief by a bunch of professors has a different view of the history than you're describing.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, what I take, what I take from their analysis is a hostility towards attorneys' fees being allowed in bankruptcy. And perhaps maybe as a matter of policy, if we were to start from scratch, well, maybe we shouldn't allow attorneys' fees to be allowed in bankruptcy. Maybe we shouldn't allow tort claims to be allowed in bankruptcy. Maybe we shouldn't allow certain kinds of environmental claims to be allowed in bankruptcy. They don't like the rule, apparently, but their analysis of the history is wrong. And we cite innumerable cases and law review articles that demonstrate that the practice is as we say that it is. And policy reasons are no grounds to sort of create these Federal common law rules or these categorical rules of preclusions.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would you say a word about Justice Holmes' opinion in the Scruggs case.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. BRUNSTAD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Stevens. The Randolph case was decided in 1903 and the law changed dramatically since then. For example, in 1903 contingent claims were not provable under the Bankruptcy Act. That changed in 1938 when contingent claims became provable under the Bankruptcy Act. Randolph & Randolph versus Scruggs involved the claim of a custodian, a custodian, an assignee, who took control of all the debtor's assets before the bankruptcy filing. Now under Section 503(b)(3)(E), the Randolph versus Scruggs analysis as it pertains to the claims of the assignee, those are now treated as an administrative expense under Section 503 dealing with administrative expenses. In Randolph, it's interesting, the fees -- Justice Kennedy, the fees incurred in preparing the assignment were allowed as an unsecured claim in the bankruptcy case. Justice Holmes for the Court said they are allowed. So in fact Randolph I think refutes their analysis rather than supports it.
05-1429 +++$+++ 37402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37406 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument first today in case 05-1508, Zuni Public School District, et al. vs. Department of Education. Mr. Van Amberg.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37408 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: In 1994, Congress enacted the equalization formula under the Impact Aid Act. It did so clearly and decisively, and described a methodology which was unambiguous, was self contained, reflected a recognized statistical standard, and assisted in actually promulgating -- and -- the intent of the Impact Aid Act, which is to benefit impacted local educational agencies or school districts and not fund the general educational program of the States. In so doing, Congress removed from the Secretary the previously delegated authority to establish by regulation the equalization formula. The Secretary in turn in 1996, in enacting his regulations in response to the 1994 legislation, disavowed that he was engaging in any rulemaking or in fact in any interpretations of statutes. Instead, the Secretary sought and announced that he was proceeding under an exception to the public notice and comment laws, 5 U.S.C. 553(b), by stating that his regulations merely reflected changes in legislation, refining regulatory language.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Van Amberg, they were essentially the same as the prior regulations, were they not? And those regulations had gone through the notice and comment process.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. That is correct, Justice Ginsburg -- Ginsburg. Those were essentially, except for a few words here and there, those were the same regulations. But they were in response to a congressional directive back in 1974 that the Secretary is to create the equalization formula. In 1994, Congress came in with legislation and established that formula.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought that the formula was proposed to Congress by the Department of Education, which is not something that Congress did in other words, to stop the Secretary from whatever he was doing. But it was indeed -- wasn't it the Secretary's own language that Congress enacted?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The contention is made that this 545-page omnibus education bill --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, just as to that, the provision that we're talking about, do you say, you say it wasn't drafted by the Department of Education?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think we know exactly who it was drafted by. I think there is -- there is some references in the Congressional -- Congressional Record that this is an administration bill. But I would, I would like to respond, Justice Ginsburg, based on the assumption that this was the Secretary's bill. Under the statutory formula, the language is clear that what is disregarded in -- in ranking LEAs and eliminating percentiles of LEAs is those LEAs which fall above the 95th percentile --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Before you get into the substance let's -- let's finish with this, this problem, whether it was indeed the other Secretary's own bill. Was the Secretary who proposed the -- the '94 legislation, the same Secretary who had promulgated the prior regulations?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. This --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The prior regulations were promulgated when?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The former regulations were promulgated in 1976.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ My goodness, that's a long time before.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's a long time.

05-1508 +++$+++ 37422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And a different agency. There wasn't even --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So there's no reason to believe that the same Secretary -- that the Secretary continued to have the same view of what was proper, is there?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We view that it did not and, and also, Justice Scalia and Justice Ginsburg, we also view that if this was the chief educational officer of the Federal Government, he was more than capable of developing a statute which reflected his methodology of --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Indeed he could have copied the regulations that were on the book and just put them in the statute, couldn't he?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, even in the same act, Your Honor, under when they had the EFIG statute, there Congress was able to reference the regulations of the Secretary. They didn't do so when they were, when they enacted the impact aid part of it. So --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, as -- as far as the difference in time, it was the Secretary's decision, the later Secretary's decision to retain, as you acknowledged, the, almost the identical regulation. You said it didn't go through notice and comment the second time, but the text was basically the same in '76 and in --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He didn't -- if I could, Your Honor, he did not retain the second regulation. This was supposed to be a new regulation which was promulgated by the Secretary because the Impact Aid Act had been repealed --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37430 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- and re-enacted.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- and I appreciate that. But the text of it, what the regulation said was not significantly different from what the earlier regulation said.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. But it --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was this the same Secretary, by the way, as the Secretary who issued the new regulation, the same Secretary that was in office when the new legislation had been proposed?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The new legislation was '94. Secretary enacted it in '96. I think it probably was. I -- I -- it was the same administration.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why, why would the Secretary, if indeed it was his bill, why would he deprive himself of the power to decide what the formula should be? Which is the power he had before. I mean, one must think that there must have been some pressures from elsewhere when the Secretary goes in and says take some power away from me, please.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that, and I would agree, Justice Scalia, that that is not a, a usual event where an administration intentionally disgorges from itself its own authority. And, and I would also point out the fact that again, there is a dramatic difference between what, what the statute proposed and, and the methodology described in the regulation. And what's, what's very significant is if you go back to 1976 when the original regulation was promulgated, there was a debate that went on in the public notice and comment portion of these proceedings where they discussed whether you eliminate percentile of LEAs directly or whether you add this extra step of eliminating percentage, percentages of pupils and then eliminating LEAs as these pupils are eliminated. I mean, it's a totally different process, totally different philosophy behind them and as we can see in this particular case, in New Mexico and in Alaska, totally different results.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Mr. Van Amberg, is the statutory language really as unambiguous as you suggest? It says above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile, but it doesn't say above the 95th percentile of local education agencies or below the 5th percentile of local education agencies, does it?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Alito, I, I think what you, I think it is clear and unambiguous. And the reason is that if you, in order to run a percentile calculation you need units against which to run that, and then you need these, an identified set of variable standards such as they provided here, the average per pupil expenditures of each set of these LEAs or districts. So you rank the, the LEAs. You've got the variable values and then it, it's, the statute provides that you find that you eliminate those LEAs which are above the 95th percentile. And then if you go back to what "such" means and referencing back to other portions of the statute, it's 95th percentile of the revenues and expenditures of the LEAs in the State. It's a very similar process for --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but what do you distribute?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Pardon?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What do you distribute? I mean, I agree you have a, some kind of, let's put something on cards, so you have thousands of cards and each one has a number on it. What are you distributing -- the cards? Are you, are you -- what's distribute -- a 5th percentile refers to some kind of distribution. What's it a distribution of?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's the distribution of the percent of the, what is --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it a thing?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Like a thing.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Like a -- like a set of things that you're distributing, what are they?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The thing that you're running the percentile against is the total number of, of expenditures and revenues in the State.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In other words, you take all the -- there is a set of numbers, each number is a different number and the characteristic of each number is there some school district that spends per, or takes in per pupil, revenue equal to that number. So we write each one on a card. Is that what we're, is that our distribution? We have like, let's say we have a, a thousand cards. Is that what it is?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you know, in New Mexico's case you have --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. No. I'm not, I'm saying what do you think it has to be? What do you think it should be? What are, what is it we are distributing? A simple question, I guess, for a statistician. I unfortunately am not one and can't find one, so I have no idea what this statute means. (Laughter.)
05-1508 +++$+++ 37450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the, the -- the value against which --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not a value. I want to know what I'm distributing. And if you don't know I would say that this is, I have never seen a case so much better fitted for relying on the views of an agency.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Counsel, I thought you said that you did know what it was. I thought you simply quoted the statute, the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State. That's what's being distributed.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry, I don't know how --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Such revenues or expenditures in the State consist of, the word "such" obviously refers you back to some prior reference to revenues in the State, and that prior reference in subsection A is a reference to district by district, not pupil by pupil.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That, that's correct.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So, so in other words we are distributing those cards, it's a set of numbers? If you're certain, isn't it fair to say that this statute is not clear as to what it is you're distributing?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I'm sorry, Justice -- I'm -- Breyer; I'm having a little trouble understanding --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- I thought not. Is there a --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the question.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're not certain about the hypothetical but you're certain about the statute, aren't you?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm certain about the statute. You're provided the variable values that are attributed to each of the LEAs; you rank them; and you provide a percentile. It's a methodology which was described in 1976. It's a methodology employed every day in ranking students and schools.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yeah -- that -- right. But I unfortunately don't know enough about this subject, so I thought, not being an expert on it, that when you referred to a percentile, you have some group of things, a set of things that's being distributed in a certain order and there is a top of that and a bottom of that.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And if that's what percentile refers to, I just want to know what those things are that are being distributed. And - and that's where I find the ambiguity. And if there is an ambiguity, I guess we are going to take the view of the agency at least as I understand it. So -- so that's why I asked the question.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. And, and I think I understand the question now, Justice Breyer. Thank you. The units that are ranked or distributed are the LEAs or the school districts. And they are ranked in order of their per pupil expenditures and revenues. Those are the units and the component parts of this calculation that are provided for us by Congress.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And does the statute say you have to do it that way? It has to be the group that's distributed?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's my understanding under -- under Brown and Williamson is if Congress speaks to an issue, Congress is to be obeyed.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Clearly.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is nothing mysterious about this type of a methodology. And this is the one that Congress chose.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, you could do it that way and the reason the Government, I think, says that you shouldn't do it that way is that it would produce an absurd result.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That the object of the statute is to catch the outliers. And if you, for example, had one giant school district like New York City which was at the top of the list and another giant school district that was at the bottom of the list you would cut those two out, and you might have cut out half the pupils in the whole State, and those wouldn't be outliers would they? I mean, that's the problem.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you have a similar infirmity associated with the other methodology. That is, if you have a number of LEAs which are small in numbers, as in New Mexico, particularly if you had a number of small LEAs at the bottom, which is I think a huge problem policy wise, you were to cut them out and let them to float off in their poverty. I think, I can understand where there is --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Doesn't, doesn't subsection b(ii) address outliers? I was surprised there wasn't more discussion of that in the briefing and maybe it's, it's because of some reason I'm unaware of. That says that the Secretary in making this determination can take into account particular types of LEAs where there is extra, additional costs. I would have thought for example if you had a very small LEA with only 20 students and the cost is particularly high because you don't have economies of scale, that you haven't -- that would, could be knocked out for that reason. Is that not how that works?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. And this is the, the whole problem, that we can argue philosophically how whether Congress's methodology or the Secretary's methodology is better, but the backdrop of this is that the, the statute and also the regulation allows for school, for the States to back out all these disequalizing expenditures so that you, you make an adjustment to more or less end up with a baseline per pupil expenditure. And there is really no reason after you do that for having a wide disparity, even between the top and the bottom LEA. The Secretary's formula, and I don't think we should be arguing whose formula is better, because if they are different, Congress wins, but nevertheless, the Secretary's formula, it eliminates 26 percent of the school districts. And under New Mexico, if you, if you look at the top and the bottom school district even after the eliminating of these funding differentials, you've got a 244 percent disparity.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It, it eliminates 26 school districts but those 26 school districts account for 5 percent or 10 percent of the pupils. And I guess what we are interested in here is not school districts; they are not a thing -- they are a thing of a kind, but we are interested in students, real people who get money. And so that it, that it -- it eliminates 26 percent of the school districts would see, to be a good thing, not a bad thing, because what we are really interested in are the pupils and it keeps in 90 percent of the pupils.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And Justice Breyer, I think Congress and in its methodology has disagreed with that view, because it does not rely strictly upon pupils, and pupils are not necessarily the driving force in how we work this formula.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought the problem was disparity in school districts. Since much of the funding for education is local funding, in some places there are very rich school districts and very, very poor, poor school districts. And I thought that the purpose of this was to make sure that there is not an enormous disparity, not pupil to pupil but district to district. It makes perfect sense, it seems to me.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that is correct. Because these districts particularly in New Mexico serve a unique purpose. New Mexico has pockets of, of urban and populations, and then they have got small traditional villages; they have got farming communities; they have got Indian lands; they have got military bases. And a school district whether it educates 100 children or 1,000 children or 5,000 children has a special value in the State and in our educational process. And simply because a child in New Mexico attends the school district that does not have particularly many students in it doesn't mean that he has to suffer a poorer education than his brethren and brothers and sisters in the metropolitan area.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Van Amberg, if there is any ambiguity in the statute, one relevant consideration might be how would this work across States, and I think it's true, is it not, that your reading would lead to wildly different, wildly different results from State to State depending on whether they have large districts or small districts at the top and the bottom, whereas the other way, counting pupils rather than school districts regardless of size, you would get uniformity going from State to State.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the Secretary recognized in 1976 that both methodologies have their problems, depending on how your districts, the number of districts that you have in a State, their relative populations, how they line up. And --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Am I correct in understanding that at the end of the line here, if you win the Federal money will go to your two districts, whereas if the other side wins the Federal money will go to the State? Is that what the bottom line is?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the bottom line.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I would point out, Justice Stevens, that Congress has made it clear that the impact aid is supposed to go to the impacted districts. It is not supposed to fund the general educational program of a State. The money that the State, that the State of New Mexico seeks to retain is under a limited exception that has been created and it is, it is not that we are trying to take the State's money as the bottom line. It is that the State has taken the impact aid dollars and doesn't have an equalized system. New Mexico could equalize if it wants to. It established its equalization formula.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me ask another general question. If it were true, and I don't think it is in this case, that the biggest district was the one that got the most per pupil money -- the two biggest districts that were at the opposite ends of the spectrum, they would all be taken out, wouldn't they, under your view?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it actually depends -- you get into statistical approaches, but if, let's say, there were less than 20 districts, you just had let's say 18 districts or 19 districts, then if you do the percentile against, if you work the percentile in that particular setting, nobody gets eliminated.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you have the same problem if it's students, I take it? You'd have the same statistical question whether you, you use districts or students?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Correct, because you would run -- because if you had districts, big districts at both ends, you run your 5 percent on both ends with the students, you end up not eliminating anybody.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's all right. I wouldn't think that was a problem. But what about Justice Stevens' question. There are 20 districts in our State -- it's exaggerated, let me exaggerate it -- and the rich district has 20, has a quarter of the students, and the poor district has another quarter. So our outliers in that situation which we're eliminating from our calculation are the rich district and the poor district. One's at the top, one's at the bottom. And now we're left with 18 districts to figure out whether they're equalized. But those 18 districts account for less than half or about half of all the students. That's the problem. It seems that isn't very representative and we're trying to get representativeness.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Breyer, I, I would respectfully like to go back, not to what we are trying to accomplish through judicial decision, but what Congress accomplished through its decision.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand that. If the language doesn't permit it you can't do it, they can't, and you win. But if the language does permit it, the reason -- you have to stretch the language, I suspect, in my view to get to the Government's result. It might just barely permit it. But one of the things on their side is that if we take your view it produces an absurd result, because of what Justice Ginsburg said, because there is such variation in the number of pupils among school districts in different states.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. If I could address that, Your Honor. The only argument I see the State has is the argument about absurdity. This debate that we're having now is the debate that took place in 1976 in front of the Secretary. He recognized that there were two methodologies that he was considering. He recognized that they both had their problems. But in 1994, Congress had before it at least or had available to it information as to the, whether, what, how this particular formula would work. There were only three and perhaps -- three States, Kansas, Alaska, New Mexico, and perhaps Arizona -- that had -- that were trying to take advantage of the, of this narrow exception. So they knew the configuration and the composition of these school districts. And so they could look if they wanted to -- and there's no legislative history to this, but they could have looked if they had wanted to, to exactly what the practical effect would be of these two formulas. And the practical effect is that in New Mexico the formula which the Respondents contend is absurd reduced only 11 percent of the LEAs. And with the backdrop that this, that these LEAs should have been more or less equalized anyhow because of removing the disparate funding, that's, that's much more reasonable and certainly doesn't reflect an absurdity, and when you compare that to the Secretary's approach which eliminates 26 percent and cuts loose 23 school districts out of 89 from any consideration and you end up with kind of a core block in their 14 or 15 percent disparity, I think there may be those who could argue forcefully that that's an absurdity.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I see your white light is on. I don't want to take -- would the other States make that same answer that you just made?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Kansas equalizes under any formula, as New Mexico did, could do. Alaska, you eliminate 22 percent in order for them to just kind of squeak by. If they applied Congress's formula they would just equalize. This is an option I contend that's available to every State that wants to take advantage. If you give them a 25 percent disparity allowance, you allow them to back out disequalizing expenditures. There's really no explanation that's been offered why there's any disequalization at all. With that, if there is any time -- unless there are any further questions.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37499 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
05-1508 +++$+++ 37500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Srinivasan, you don't want us to stretch the language, do you?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think you need to stretch the language, Justice Scalia.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you wouldn't urge us to do either, would you?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it depends on what you mean by stretch. (Laughter.)
05-1508 +++$+++ 37504 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The question, the question before the Court is whether the Secretary's formula is unambiguously foreclosed by the statutory test, not whether it's the better reading, but whether it's unambiguously foreclosed. And we happen to think it's the better reading, but we certainly think it's not unambiguously foreclosed. And maybe the clearest indication that Congress did not unambiguously foreclose the Secretary's methodology --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37505 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's the case that says "unambiguously foreclosed"?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Brand X says that, but it's a characterization of the step one inquiry under Chevron. And we can use "foreclosed" if you like, Your Honor. But the clearest indication that the statute does not foreclose the Secretary's methodology is a provision that I think hasn't been addressed thus far in the argument and that's that in the very same act in Congress in which Congress enacted Section 7709, the provision at issue here, Congress also explicitly endorsed and incorporated the Secretary's --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You begin with an argument that directly cuts against your position. They knew how to do it under the -- I assume you're referring to the education finance and incentive grant program?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I am.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they did it there, they didn't do it here. To me that suggests the opposite of the inference you're trying to draw.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so, Mr. Chief Justice, with respect. There are two education finance incentive grant program, or EFIG, provisions that we identified in the briefs and one of them I would acknowledge is susceptible to that line of argument, although I don't think it's persuasive. But it's the other one that I'm focusing on, and what the other one does is to explicitly incorporate the Secretary's regulations and so what Congress said in 1994 is that for purposes --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37511 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which they did not say in this act.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They didn't, but I think it would be very odd to attribute to Congress the intention on one hand to say, we like your regulation, so much so that we want to use it and we want you to continue to use it for purposes of the EFIG program --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Different purposes.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're not --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're for different purposes.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're not different purposes at all, Justice Scalia, with respect. They're the exact same purpose. In both programs what Congress wanted to do was to get an assessment of the extent to which education expenditures were equalized in a State among school districts. They're the very same purpose.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But for different purposes. In the one case, in this act we're worried about an extensive Federal presence that has an effect on the tax base available for schools and under the EFIG program it's an entirely different question of equalization.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, at that level of generality you might be right, but with respect to the purpose of the equalization provisions of both of those acts the purpose is exactly the same. In impact aid, just like in EFIG, the question is to what extent has the State equalized expenditures across school districts. It's the very same question.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, maybe let me ask it directly. If they could so easily just say we incorporate the Secretary's regulation in EFIG, why didn't they do it here?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, because --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They instead went to the trouble of mimicking part of the regulation, but not mimicking the appendix, which is where your calculation methodology is.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they didn't mimic it. They incorporated it. And so far as the argument is that they incorporated just the regulation qua regulation and not the appendix to the regulation, I don't think that that argument can be squared with the statutory text or the regulatory text.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I ask, is there a difference legally between a regulation and an appendix to the regulation?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so, at least not in the circumstance of this case, where the regulation by its own terms incorporates the appendix. And so when Congress incorporated the regulation it necessarily incorporated the appendix.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you say "incorporated," though. What it did was it took the language and it did not take --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I don't think so, Your Honor. The text of the statute in 1994 is set forth at the top of page 30 of the Government's brief, and I'm quoting from the second line of page 30 and what Congress said in the EFIG statute in 1994, again in the very same act that enacted this language --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In the EFIG statute?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In the EFIG statute.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But in this statute the regulation says look to the, look at the appendix. Congress as I understood when it enacted our statute, it took language from the regulation; it didn't take the part that said look to the appendix.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it didn't take the part that said look to the appendix because I don't know that that would have been a sensible thing to do when you're enacting a statute. But the point I'm trying to make is that when Congress in the EFIG statute incorporated the regulation it specifically referred to the regulation that the Secretary had in place at that time.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it didn't do that here?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It didn't do that here, but it didn't have to. It makes sense --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I still think it cuts against you rather than for you, the fact that they could have done the same thing here and we wouldn't have this case.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let me just make one more point on this, Your Honor, and then I'll move to the text of Section 7709, because I do think that this point has a great deal of force. The reason that Congress would have incorporated the regulation specifically in EFIG but not in impact aid is because we're dealing with an impact aid regulation. So the Secretary ordinarily wouldn't have thought that he should apply the impact aid regulation for purposes of EFIG unless Congress told him to do that and that's what Congress did. But with respect to impact aid, there's no reason to incorporate the regulation. The regulation already existed, and the question is did Congress in this act foreclose the Secretary from continuing to apply that longstanding regulatory methodology. And I would suggest that if Congress really wanted to --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Srinivasan, if we could come to the, to the text that you're talking about.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What I don't understand about the Government's position is why you use this, this per pupil theory for purposes of (B)i), but don't use it for purposes of (A). You, you don't -- in the major computation portions, namely for purposes of paragraph 1, a program of State aid equalizes expenditures among local expenditures, if in the second fiscal year is made the amount of per pupil expenditures made by or per pupil revenue available to, you do it agency by agency, don't you? You DON'T apply this, you know, it depends on how many pupils in each agency. Why don't you do for both?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if you look at 2(a), Your Honor what that says is that the disparity, the disparity standard at its broadest level deals with whether the per-pupil revenues for the highest ranked local educational agency exceeds the per pupil revenues for the lowest one by 25 percent.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It would make no difference if you take into account pupils for that part of the analysis, and here's the reason why. When you take into account pupils with respect to a local educational agency and you weight the local, the figure by the number of pupils served by the local educational agency, the per pupil figure that you're going to attach to each of those individual pupils is the same. It's the same per pupil figure for each one. It's just that you multiply it by the number of pupils. So for purposes of this part of the statute, where you're comparing the highest to the lowest, whether you took into account the number of pupils or not you'd still be dealing with the same two figures. You'd be dealing with a figure that applies to the highest ranked local educational agency and you'd be dealing with a figure that applies to the lowest ranked local educational agency.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're saying it comes to the same, but the fact remains you don't use that methodology in A, because you don't think the language requires that methodology. And it is the same language in B.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, there would be -- I don't know that we use one or the other. It's just that there would be absolutely no purpose served by using pupils with respect to --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the purpose would be to follow the language of the statute, and if you think that the language in B requires this kind of an approach you should take the same approach in A, especially if it makes no difference.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, no; especially because it makes no difference, because with respect to the B part of it, the 95th and 5th percentile exclusions, it makes all the difference in the world whether you take into account --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I have a conceptual difficulty, and it may be my limitations with the way you do it. You take students and you assign a per-pupil number to each individual student.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Effectively.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I would have thought the per-pupil concept only makes sense if you're dealing with LEAs. They have a per-pupil number because they've got a bunch of pupils. You take individual students, and you know for example in that school district you don't spend the same amount of money on the kindergartner that you spend on the eighth grader. And yet, you give the kindergartner a per-pupil number and the eighth grader a per-pupil number that is the same. It's an artificial association. It makes sense to speak of per-pupil numbers when you're referring to the LEAs because they have so many pupils, they get so much money, you can do the calculation. It doesn't make sense to say, you know, John Smith the kindergartner has a per-pupil expenditure of a thousand dollars. He may have $200 and the eighth grader 2,000, so why are you creating this artificial association and then using, using that methodology?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's an approximation to be sure, and per-pupil revenues by definition deal with approximations across the swath of students that are covered by local educational agencies.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it's only -- the reason is to rank them if you have an entity that has a swath of students, the district, that's the way it should be ranked. When you're ranking it by pupils, maybe if you ranked them by pupils and you have the actual numbers of course, which nobody does, your methodology would make sense.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think what we're really doing, Your Honor, is weighting each figure by the amount of pupils in the school district, and the reason we're doing that is to get a more accurate picture of the extent to which any one school district's per-pupil revenue figure contributes to the overall revenue pictures in the State. And if I could use one example which I think might help to crystallize why it's necessary to do this sort of weighting and why education finance practitioners routinely prescribe that you have to do this sort of weighting in order to avoid distorted results, if you consider the example of a State that has two school districts, and I'll use real examples from New Mexico. One would be the district that has the highest per-pupil revenues in the state, the Mosquero district, in which there's 57 pupils. And the other would be the Albuquerque school district, the largest school district in the State, which serves 84,000 pupils. Now the per-pupil revenues for Albuquerque are roughly $3,000 and the per-pupil revenues for Mosquero, the smaller school district, are roughly $7,000. And if you imagine a State that consists of just those two districts, and you ask the question to pair with the statutory language, what is the 50th percentile, and I'll use 50th just for ease of analysis, what is the 50th percentile of such per-pupil revenues in the State? One answer would be that you take the number for Mosquero, the 7,000 and you take the number for Albuquerque, the 3,000, you split the difference and you say the 50th percentile of per-pupil revenues in the State is $5,000. But I think that would present a very misleading picture of what's actually going on in the State.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, because it's an absurd hypothetical. What is the --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't -- I -- it is not --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is the smallest number of districts, what is the smallest number of school districts in a State?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ One.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which State has one school district?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Hawaii. Hawaii has one which is a special case but there are states that have a relatively small number of school districts.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In the, in the hypothetical you posed why couldn't the Secretary address that disparity under (b)(ii)? In other words, the school district which has only 57 students, it seems to me could be taken out of the calculation under (b)(ii), and then you would be dealing only with more representative school districts, not the special case of the particularly isolated school district or whatever.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37562 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Two points on (b)(ii), Mr. Chief Justice. The first is that by -- by the statutory text, (b)(ii) is over and above what you do in (b)(i,). The 95th and 5th percentiles exclusions. So you first have to do that. But the more relevant point --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why do you have to do that? Why do you have to do it first? It says you can take into account this -- extent to which the program reflects additional costs in particular districts.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, my point is simply that under (b)(i) the statute says the Secretary shall disregard local education agencies that are above the 95th and below the 5th percentile. So I think the Secretary has to do that. Now (b)(ii) in some sense could be seen as an additional option for the Secretary over and above the exclusion, but there is a more fundamental point which is that with (b)(ii), it says take into account the extent to which a program of State aid reflects the additional costs. And so what that does is a piggyback on the way that the State approaches the situation. So this, as -- this provision as the Secretary understands it allows it to give effect to a State that gives effect to those sorts of considerations, but it's not an independent grant of authority for the Secretary himself to take those considerations into account.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37565 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Srinivasan, you -- you may have convinced me. I'll stipulate that you have convinced me that the argument that you're arguing for would probably be a better method, but you haven't touched the text of (b)(2)(b)(i) yet, and that's where some of us at least are, are having our -- our problems. Do you agree that in the absence of the other program, I forget the, the acronym for it -- that you really would not have any argument that there is ambiguity in the text here?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37566 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. No. Absolutely not.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37567 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then -- then would you address the text?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure, I will. It's at page 4a of the appendix of the Government's brief, b -- (b)(i). And what the text says is disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above the 59th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now one point I make --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So what is supposed to be disregarded are educational agencies?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. And the agencies are identified how? How do we identify the agencies that would be disregarded?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You identify the agencies to be disregarded by first identifying the 59th and 5th percentiles of per-pupil revenues in the State. And then you disregard --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And we identify their per-pupil revenues, too, don't we? Agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above or below, right?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but -- and -- but the critical test is the 95th percentile and 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that critical test is being applied to an agency which is being identified by reference to per-pupil expenditures or revenues, correct?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is. I mean there is no doubt that the per-pupil revenues or expenditure figures that lie on the spectrum are associated with the local educational agencies. That's how --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's not merely that they are associated with. The very definition, the very identification of LEA here is exclusively in terms of per-pupil expenditures or revenues. It's not merely in association. It is a definition, isn't that so?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think so. The --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then, then what does the phrase with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above 95 or below 5 mean?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's true that each local education agency has a per-pupil expenditure or revenue. But the critical part of the statute which has 59th percentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues doesn't foreclose weighting. And I think the point that Justice Alito made bears, which is --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, why doesn't it? It seems to me that the only identification of an entity or person, if you want, to be disregarded is the identification of an LEA, and the LEA is described in terms exclusively of its expenditures or revenues. So why doesn't that foreclose your position?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we -- two parts to the answer, Justice Souter. First the Secretary's formulation, no less than Petitioner's formulation, does disregard local educational agencies with per-pupil revenues above the 95th and 5th percentiles.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. Obviously --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where we disagree is in identifying the 95th exactly.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ After identifying them in terms of the expenditures or revenues. That's what you're supposed to do.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Exactly. And I'd -- exactly. And I'd reiterate the point that Justice Alito made earlier, which is that Congress could have compelled the approach that Petitioners compelled -- contend, if it would have said --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There are lots of things that Congress could have done differently from what it did do, but it, that doesn't seem to me to inject an ambiguity in the identification in, in this subsection of the LEA that we are talking about. And it doesn't create an ambiguity in, in the clear provision that what is to be disregarded is an LEA as so defined.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think it does, Your Honor, because there are two different ways of ranking the LEAs. One is to take the per-pupil revenues associated with each LEA and simply take that list into account. Another is to take the same list but then weight it by the number of pupils in each LEA.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure, that's another way to --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Nothing in the statute forecloses that approach.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- do it, but tell me why that is consistent with the text.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because the text refers to the 95th and 5th percentiles of such expenditures or revenues in the State, and the list that includes the weighting does represent a list of expenditures or revenues in the State.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would such be -- of such expenditures or revenues. That refers back to local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues. It's referring you back not to the totality of students but to, to agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. And I don't, I don't dispute that the per-pupil revenue figures belong to a local educational agency. But again that doesn't mean that you can't take into account the relative extent to which a particular school district contributes to the overall State picture, and the way you do that --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Wouldn't the statute have told you, though, to, to disregard pupils according to the ranking? It does tell you to disregard LEAs, which suggests the ranking -- at least to me, that the ranking ought to be of LEAs and not pupils.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it is, it is a ranking of LEAs in the first instance and then it's, each of those LEA figures is weighted by the number of pupils the way we do it, and we do end up disregarding LEAs. But as Justice Souter pointed out the first step is identifying the 5th and 95th percentiles, and on that step we take into account the number of pupils. It's only at that step that we take into account the number of pupils.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And nothing in the statute forecloses that. I'm sorry.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- a rather basic question? What if I'm convinced that your opponent's reading is really only the fair reading of the statute, but I'm also convinced by you that that's not what Congress intended. What should I do? (Laughter.)
05-1508 +++$+++ 37602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, one way or another I think your should rule in our favor. (Laughter.)
05-1508 +++$+++ 37603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well no. Accept, accept my premises. What do you think I should do?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think in that situation you sort of have the sliding scale that we often confront with textual analysis. And if you really think that Congress would have compelled an absurd result, and I think it does verge on that, then you would --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think it has to be absurd, it's just, I would measure it by what Congress actually intended. Assume there two permissible readings, and two -- both of them make sense. And I'm convinced, assume I'm convinced by you, that they really intended to perpetuate the prior method of procedure. May I take that, may I come to that result even though I think the language really says exactly what your opponent says it says?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if the language absolutely unambiguously compels that reading, then I think it would be a difficult position. But I don't think it goes, goes to that degree.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would have thought your office had answered that question in countless briefs where it tells us to be guided by the language of the statute and not some unexpressed intent.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's why I said, if you think that the statute unambiguously actually compels that reading, then I don't know that we would have a position.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you still have a Church of the Holy Trinity team over there somewhere, don't you? (Laughter.)
05-1508 +++$+++ 37610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why doesn't it -- why doesn't absolutely compel it? Where is the ambiguity, you say?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37611 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It says --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37612 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the 5th percentile of such per-pupil expenditure. And that --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37613 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37614 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now how are you going to get that so it doesn't just say just list cards with per-pupil expenditure on it, different ones and take the top five?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37615 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, well it's just the number of cards, ultimately, under your hypothetical, Justice Breyer.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you have a lot of cards that have the same cards that have the same number? You have a lot --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They have the same cards, we just have -- they have the numbers, exactly.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37618 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37619 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's the same cards with the same numbers. We just add more cards in order to reflect the extent to which each LEA contributes to the overall picture.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37620 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And why, why don't you take the top five where we have 10 percent of the students, let's take the second five and they happens to have the same number on the card as the first five, and why don't they fall in the first 5 percent?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37621 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not sure I understand.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37622 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. Forget it. (Laughter.)
05-1508 +++$+++ 37623 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sorry.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can you enlighten us a little bit about how this statute developed?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As far as I know it was the same Secretary of Education when the statute came on the books and when the regulation was kind of readopted, I think it was --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that's right, Justice Ginsburg.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there was a peculiar proposal to drop, it was the Secretary's proposal to drop the bottom five. So it was a different proposal, and what was the reason for that? Why keep, keep the 95th percentile but not the 5th?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, as we point out in a footnote in our brief there was some education finance experts that suggested there would be no reason to retain the exclusion at the bottom of the range, and I think that's because when you have low per-pupil revenues there is a reason not to exclude those figures. But the important point is the material important part of the language, which is 95th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State, is exactly what the Secretary proposed and the Secretary of course wouldn't have curtailed his own discretion to continue the same methodology that he had long had in place. Thank you.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Counsel. Mr. Manasevit.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37632 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I'd like to begin with Justice Ginsburg's question, because I think that that is very illuminating to where we are today. This statute began against a history, an 18-year history where the agency had been delegated by Congress virtually carte blanche authority to devise equalization tests. That was the earlier statute. The agency had three tests at the time. One was the 25 percent disparity test that we see today and there were two other tests. In 1994, what happened was the Secretary proposed to the Congress and the Congress following the Secretary's lead eliminated the two other tests. That's, that's what was happening. And Justice Scalia asked well, why would the Secretary tie his hands? What happened was the Secretary no longer was satisfied or liked the other two tests and eliminated those and proposed the test that he had been using for 18 years to the Congress. Congress adopted that test and that's the test that we have today, the 25 percent disparity test. The difference is that whereas the Secretary had the free rein to develop that disparity test, however he wanted, previously, the Secretary -- the Congress now told the Secretary in disparity, do the following things. First of all 25 percent is the maximum disparity that we are going to allow you, number one. And number two, take out the outliers in a range of 5 to --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't it -- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You know, I really don't care what the Secretary thought he was doing. I mean, it seems to me we have to ask the question, what would a member of Congress who voted on this thing have thought he was voting for, who had, you know, didn't have this history you're giving us. And more importantly, what would a citizen to whom this language is promulgated think the language means? I don't care what the Secretary had in the back of his mind. Why should that make any difference to us?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Fair question, Justice Scalia, and that brings us back to the language of the statute, where of course we begin, and we have to look precisely to the language of the statute. The language of the statute, what Petitioners mistake is that the language of the statute here has a two-part process. We don't look at LEAs first. It doesn't say 5th percentile of LEAs. We have to first rank expenditures or revenues in the State. It's above 95th percentile or below 5th percentile of the expenditures.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of such expenditures or revenues.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of such.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you've got to find out what "such" refers to.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And "such" would refer just to the previous usage of that precise term, which is disregard local education agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues. So it's that "with per-pupil revenues" that the "such" would refer back to, the most immediate prior reference, so we're still looking at per-pupil revenues or expenditures in the State which we have to rank first. We don't identify LEAs first. It doesn't say 95th percentile of LEAs. It tells us rank per-pupil revenue. The only difference --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It says disregard LEAs; it then identifies certain LEAs which are to be disregarded. Nowhere does it say disregard pupils.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. It says -- it says -- we are disregarding the LEAs. That's the end of the process. But we have to identify the range of value that 5 percent and 95 percent applies to. The range -- the percentiles apply to a range of values. We have in New Mexico, we have 89 amounts of per-pupil revenue per district, we have 89 of those. But we also have 377,000 per-pupil revenues, because a per-pupil revenue repeats for every time that there's a student, and --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. No. See, that's my conceptual difficulty. It is only per pupil when you're dealing with an aggregation of the pupils. If you're going to break it down pupil by pupil, which is what you do, you don't have a per-pupil number associated with each pupil. You have a number. Nobody knows what it is because nobody knows how much you spend on each individual. We know how much you give to this district, and therefore, the district has a per-pupil number, and therefore, I would have thought a reference to per-pupil numbers suggests you're grouping according to district.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, we are not saying that it can't. We're -- all we're saying is that it equally carries both meanings. School finance is an extraordinarily technical area, which is precisely why Congress left this issue to the agency to work this out. When Congress -- when Congress used the terms 5 percent and 10 percent, and again I'm not, I'm not reading Congress's mind to say that when Congress used those terms, those percentiles, Congress must have intended some national uniformity. This is a national program and Congress expects these programs to be applied somewhat uniformly across -- across the country.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Go ahead.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me ask you the same question I asked -- I asked the Government. Why don't you, if this is a natural reading, why don't you apply it to, to 2.A? You don't even think of doing that in 2.A. In 2.A you just look at the individual agency, but it's the same language in 2.A.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In 2.A, 2.A calls for a different type of comparison. And I also note that in 2.A it refers to percent instead of percentile, which refers to two numbers being compared. Percentile refers to an entire ranking of value, so the processes are somewhat different. Now we're not, I'm not contending that this statute is absolutely clear and a model of draftsmanship, but certainly the meaning of 95th percentile or 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues is a broad enough term.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To include the words per-pupil revenue for each pupil, is that what you're saying?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, to --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How do you want to say it, per-pupil revenue attached to each pupil?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I believe --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Or how do you want to say it then?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I believe simply that the word per-pupil revenue can mean the dollar amount per each agency 89 times, or it can mean repeated each time a student generates --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is attached to each pupil? You say the word such is broad enough to include per-pupil revenue as attached to each pupil?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. Correct. Remember --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I don't know where to look to discover if you're right or wrong.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, bear in mind -- bear in mind the nature of many education --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there any statistical text that you could look at to see it that's the way people use the words?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That answer I couldn't answer, but I can tell you that typically in an education statute, funding is distributed on the basis of numbers of pupils. So if the statute says $3,000 per pupil shall go somewhere, the -- the statute means you take that dollar amount and you --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that must not be right, because otherwise we wouldn't have any disparity to worry about equalization in the first place. Right?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we always -- we always will have disparity in the real world and that -- and that's because lots of things cause disparity. In this case actually, local tax revenues are not the cause of disparity because there are no significant local tax revenues at issue here. But disparity happens -- in the top three or four districts in New Mexico you have under 100 students, or slightly over 100 students. In a district that small, minor things, an insurance recovery for example, a couple hundred thousand dollar insurance recovery in a district of 87 students will generate $3,000 of revenue per member for that year. It's a distorting figure. That's precisely what Congress is trying to get rid of. But when Congress says 5 percent, presumably Congress intends that 5 percent to have some uniform applicability across the country and not vary with a State like New Mexico where it would just eliminate five districts. Or in our -- in our neighboring State of Maryland, Montgomery County has the highest per-pupil revenues in the State. It has 16 percent of the population. Under petitioners' view, that -- and it has 24 districts, so that district would be eliminated under petitioners' view. It would completely be eliminated. Yet under our view, the 10 percent would fall within that and we would keep it in. So --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Don't you think Congress, if Congress is concerned about the, in this provision, about the impact of the Federal presence, and your reading prevents the money that Congress meant to go to those particular districts from actually reaching the districts, I mean, wouldn't we be inclined to read it the way that, let the money get where Congress meant it to go?
05-1508 +++$+++ 37663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, because that was on the list of things that I wanted to cover, and I'm sure that petitioners 'counsel inadvertently misspoke. Impact aid never ever gets diverted from the district. Impact Aid goes from the Federal Government pursuant to a formula --
05-1508 +++$+++ 37664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, sure, but then the question is whether the State can consider it when they're figuring out how much money to give it. So in effect it's diverted.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, remember, the State figures a total cost of program for every district starting from zero, number of students and dollars needed to manage those number of students, and the State supplies that amount of money. So where the district gets some of that necessary money from another source, the State under equalization is allowed to just consider that that amount of money, in addition to what the State is going to provide, will provide the entire amount.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, counsel.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MANASEVIT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you very much.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Van Amberg, you have three minutes remaining.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37670 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice had a question as to whether or not the, an appendix is something different from a regulation or carries a different weight, and I haven't found anything determinative. But I would refer the Court to Young versus Community Nutrition Institute where it identifies something similar to an appendix as an example, and the Court says an example is just that, an example. And I don't think we need the argument to prevail, but we would submit that it is at best confusion, it's confusing that the Secretary would take the body of the methodology proposed by Congress, put it in his, in the body of his regulation, and then refer the public to an appendix in order to, how to work the methodology. And in this appendix, he then flips what Congress intended and what he had in the body of his own regulation. I would also suggest that Congress cannot be presumed even in this instance to not be, at least have some input as to what was happening. In the Senate bill, my understanding is that there was a suggestion that the disparity figure would only be 10 percent and not 25 percent. That didn't make it through but the statute as it was written, and I think lasted for about a year or so, had the disparity amount going from 25 percent to 20 percent. That was subsequently amended and kept back up at the 25 percent level. So the idea that this was not a bill where Congress paid attention, I think, is not a warranted assumption.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Van Amberg, could a State get to the same result? Let's say your reading of the statute is the only permissible one. By combining school districts, it's no longer going to be the X school district and the Y school district, it will be the XY school district, and then the population would increase. Still only one LEA.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is a provision, Justice Ginsburg, in the Impact Aid Act, and I think it's 7113, in which it basically says that if the Secretary of the Education perceives that a State is manipulating its LEAs in a way in which to take advantage of the, of this limited exception, it can disregard that action. So I think there is built -- I think Congress was one step ahead of us and recognized that possibility and addressed it.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VAN AMBERG +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. With that, thank you very much.
05-1508 +++$+++ 37675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37679 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument first this morning in case 05-1541, EC Term of Years Trust vs. United States. Mr. Ainsa.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37681 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The Defendant, in unequivocal language of section 1346, waives sovereign immunity and permits a refund suit by a third party such as Petitioner. That conclusion that I've stated to the Court was supported by the holding in United States versus Williams. That case, as the Court well knows, dealt with a situation in which the Government sought to recover money through a tax lien as opposed to a tax levy, which is the situation in this case. However, there is no substantive difference between the --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And why did the court point out twice in Williams that section 7426 was not available?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, section 7426 was not available in the case of Mrs. Williams, but --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because there was no levy. It was only a lien.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was a lien case, and of course, 7426 involves a levy. But nonetheless, the holding that I have read in that case very definitively deals with the breadth of section 1346. And the breadth of section 1346, according to the holding and United States vs. Williams, is certainly broad enough to encompass a third party like Petitioner. I do not view the fact that 7426 was not available to be a controlling issue because the question was whether or not 1346 would permit a third party to bring a refund action. And that was the holding of the court as I read that opinion.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But when Congress provides a special remedy for a particular class of persons, that special remedy usually excludes a more general provision.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, in the case of 7426, Congress never made that remedy expressly exclusive. The language is completely missing from that statute. And the argument was raised in United States vs. Williams that if section 1346 was made available to third parties, like Mrs. Williams, it would render meaningless the short statute of limitations. 1346 offers only post deprivation relief. section 7426 offers both pre and post deprivation relief. So the two statutes can live in harmony and can be harmonized and should not be held to have preempt -- one over the other when there is no express declaration from Congress making that the case.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Government does cite the principle that when there's a specific statutory scheme that controls over a more general one. It doesn't cite a tax case for that, at least as I recall. Has that principle ever been applied in the tax code, do you know?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, I don't believe that's been applied in the tax code, but I can answer your question, I think, by saying this. Congress on many instances has made provisions of the United States Internal Revenue Code exclusive. Congress knows how to write those provisions into the tax code when it wants to do so. In this case, it was not done. And I would also like to point out that after the decision in United States vs. Williams, Congress amended 7426 to add a special provision. And in that special provision, it was made exclusive. And I use that to exemplify the fact that Congress can, when it wants to, make a tax provision exclusive.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In the law, we don't -- we certainly don't want to deprive any statutory provision of its whole purpose and effect. And as I understand the purpose of this especially short statute of limitations, it is to enable the Government to dispose of the property that it has seized, and to be able to give clear title to it without somebody coming back, you know, many years later and saying this property should not have been taken. How is that purpose served if indeed you can proceed under the provision that has a longer statute?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, 7426 has four different components. Two of the components are clearly pre-deprivation type remedies. They are the ability of a taxpayer or third party to seek an injunction to prohibit the Government from either selling property or conducting a levy. Those are clearly pre-deprivation. The other two are primarily post deprivation remedies. And so the object that the Government was trying to achieve can be achieved through looking at it from a pre-deprivation/post-deprivation analysis. I don't believe that the Government's underlying purpose is in any way diminished when the two statutes can live in harmony. And without having an exclusivity provision expressly stated in 7426, and given the fact that 1346 on its face plainly waives sovereign immunity for third parties to bring refund suits, the two statutes must be construed --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But isn't there this difference between the two. One of them -- you're not challenging the amount of the tax in this case, are you?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I'm sorry. I didn't understand your question.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You're not challenging the amount of the assessed tax, are you? You're just -- whether they can collect it from this particular person?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Petitioner is not challenging the underlying assessment against the taxpayer.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And isn't that the basic difference between the two statutes, that one of them deals with a fight about how much money the taxpayer owes, and the other one deals with the method of collection.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 7426 clearly prevents a person from contesting the underlying assessment, whereas in 1346, that is possible. But in this case, 1346 is broad enough because it uses the term collected. And just like in Williams, we are not seeking to contest the underlying assessment.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it does seem to me if you think of the two statutes as performing rather separate functions, one primarily focused at the method of collection, the other the amount of tax, makes quite good sense to have different statute of limitations for the two, because there is an interest in the prompt resolution of the former issue that doesn't apply to the latter.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, there is certainly -- Government has demonstrated by -- or Congress has demonstrated by passing 7426, that there is an interest in a shorter statute of limitations in certain cases. However, I return to my original argument that if 1346 is broad enough to encompass third party refund suits, and if Congress has not made 7426 exclusive, the two statutes should be allowed to coexist. This Court has held on other occasions that it will not preempt statutes without a very clear expression from Congress. And Congress, once again, knew how to do it after the Williams case.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I suppose -- tell me if I'm wrong, or the Government can tell me if I'm wrong -- but there is this difference also that in a refund suit, you have to pay the money. The Government has the money before you can bring the refund suit. Am I right about that?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Incidentally, I'm just curious, if the underlying assessment -- if you wished to have challenged the underlying assessment, it's for a million dollars, can you pay $100,000 and then bring the refund suit in order to test the validity of the tax, or do you have to pay the whole amount?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The whole amount.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What about the underlying principle that waivers of sovereign immunity are strictly construed. And when you have a waiver on the broader statute, but shouldn't you read them together with the specific to suggest that they weren't waiving sovereign immunity when a more specific statute governed, except to the extent of the provisions in that more specific statute.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, when I read the opinion in United States vs. Williams, the Nordic case was brought up by the dissent in that case, that there must be an absolutely unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity in order to allow a particular suit against the United States. The holding in United States versus Williams was that 1346 was sufficiently broad. And given that holding, and given the fact that the Government was asserting that Mrs. Williams had other remedies in the form of a quiet title action, a refund action --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The court took care to point out why those were not realistic remedies. But here there is a prompt and efficient remedy.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, there is another remedy, which is certainly governed by a much shorter statute of limitations. But in my view, the equities or the facts of the case should not drive the construction of the statute, any more than it did in United States versus Williams. And if 1346 is broad enough to encompass a third party case in the instance of a lien, it is broad enough to encompass it in the case of a levy. There is no functional substantive difference between money taken from a -- from a third party via a lien or via a levy.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, your argument is probably based on the statute. I just question one phrase you mentioned, which was that Williams was not driven by the equities. It seems to me it was wholly driven by the equities.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, as I read the holding in United States vs. Williams, the Court found that there was an unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity in section 1346. And observed afterwards that a person like Mrs. Williams did not have a meaningful remedy. I did not read that to be -- that the construction of the statute was driven by the equities. It was an observation after the fact.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was a determination that the word taxpayer encompassed someone who had, in fact, paid the tax. Here you don't even have that, because the tax wasn't paid directly by the EC Trust. The trust deposited the money in the bank, and then the Government levied on it, as distinguished from Williams, where Mrs. Williams, in fact, wrote a check to the Internal Revenue Service covering her husband's tax liability.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I believe that both Mrs. Williams and the trust are in the same position. Both of them paid the tax. Both were third parties. Neither was a taxpayer. In the case of Williams, the taxpayer was her husband. In the case of the trust --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the whole case was about whether she indeed qualified as a taxpayer, having voluntarily paid the tax.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In this case, the levy was an involuntary act on the part of the Government to take the money from EC Trust, from the deposit that was put up.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. It was an involuntary act, whereas in Williams, she stepped forward and paid the tax and claimed on that basis that she was the taxpayer.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the situation in Williams, however, involved the tax lien. Mrs. Williams would not have paid the tax had the Government not asserted the tax lien and forced her to pay the tax out of the proceeds of the house when it was sold. It was no more voluntary than a levy in the sense that I'm talking about.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why isn't the obvious difference -- I may have missed this -- but you say, in the case, a taxpayer owed some money and the Government via a lien took property from a different person who then had to pay the tax who then had to get rid of the lien and wanted it back. And in this case they did exactly the same thing but they did it via a levy. So you say if the first could sue so could the second. But the difference, the obvious difference, which maybe you have explained and I missed, is that in the second case, namely this case, there is a specific statute that says you have to do it with a levy in nine months, and in the other case there wasn't such a statute. Why isn't that the obvious difference?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer, the answer is because 1346 also permits a third party to bring a refund action. It is not restricted even though there is a specific statute dealing with levies, 1346 was held to be broad enough to -- to encompass the refund action.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Encompasses a lien for a refund action in the case where you took the property via a lien. And you'd say -- they say, I guess, but it doesn't encompass it when you take it via a levy. Why not? Because of the specific, the same thing I just said. Now I want to be sure I have your whole answer to that.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37719 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ My answer to that is there is no substantive distinction between a levy and a lien. And that while Williams dealt with a lien, and I fully understand that, the taking by the Government was just as involuntary under the levy as it is with a lien. And once section 1346 is deemed to be broad enough or held to be broad enough to encompass a refund action, it should encompass an action by the levy. Essentially I'm arguing that the two statutes can coexist together and should coexist together in the absence of a clear declaration from Congress that 7426 is exclusive. I can support my argument by the fact that after Williams, Congress did make, did amend 7426 and did make a specific new remedy and they're exclusive. Congress could have done that at the time 7426 was originally enacted in 1966 but did not do so.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37720 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If your interpretation is correct then are there many such cases where the Government takes property via a levy and the person who wants to sue would get worried about nine months, because obviously he would think I can sue under a -- kind of thing. It's two years. So are there still some where he would have to worry about nine months?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37721 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In other words, are -- in your interpretation, does the nine-month statute become meaningless?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It, it does not become meaningless because 7426 offers certain remedies that are clearly post deprivation such as filing for an injunction to stop the levy, filing for an injunction to stop a foreclosure. Those are still viable under 7426 and would fall within the nine-month period but essentially Congress has permitted two different complementary actions to seek a refund.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you just -- you just pointed to situations where one to expect action to be taken promptly. You don't want to wait to, to get an injunction against a levy because the Government might be there and levy on the property and then you're out of luck. Where the incompatibility exists is post deprivation, when the nine-month, the interest in having these claims resolved properly is totally defeated if you can get the longer statute of limitations under the general refund statute.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, if I understand your question you're really talking about the underlying policy of a short statute of limitations driving certain types of --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's why the code has that nine-month period instead of the two-year or in fact four-years because you have to go to the administrative process first. The whole purpose of the nine-months is to get people to act quickly.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I can say to you that with some degree, I think, of sound legal argument, that once 1346 was found to have unequivocally waived sovereign immunity for third party refund actions in the context of a lien it should also follow that it waived sovereign immunity for levies because there is no fundamental legal difference between the manner in which the money is extracted from the third party. There is no, the core logic of the decision in United States vs. Williams is that money was involuntarily taken from Mrs. -- from Mrs. Williams.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't seem to me that the fact that there is a waiver of sovereign immunity with regard to levies answers the statute of limitations question. Sure, there is a waive of sovereign immunity, but the question is how long does the -- how promptly do you have to act?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, the -- the issue of the statute of limitations I believe is dependent upon whether or not 1346 provides for remaining a viable method of seeking a refund. And my position is that if 1346 does provide that in the context of a levy, then you have in effect two statutory schemes which coexist; one is 7426 and one is 10 - uh, 1346. It is true that they overlap in the sense that there is a refund provision that could be sought under either one of them, but 7426 is distinctly different in that it offers pre-deprivation relief that is not offered under 1326.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37730 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Getting back to my earlier question, if there is a million-dollar tax liability, and there is a levy on the bank account for $100,000, do you have to pay the extra 900,000 before can you bring the refund suit?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37731 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37732 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that's, that's also a difference.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37733 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. In this case, it wasn't a million dollars, it was $3 million and the entire amount was paid in order to bring the refund suit.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What if the amount wasn't paid and what if your client just sat back and the, the assets, or let's say some real estate were, were seized by the Government. Would the 1346 action still lie? Or is it only for return of money that, that's been paid to satisfy the tax?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 1346 in my view would not apply to that situation, in that if property was seized and used to, under a tax lien, if that was seized and the Government proceeded to sell, then the third party, Petitioner, would have to file for an injunction to stop the foreclosure sale under 7426.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that's the, it seems to me the principal problem that the Government was facing and justified the short statute, wasn't it? That is the need to get, to be able to convey clear title to this property that it has seized. But once -- once the money is put up, and what the Government has taken is in effect payment of the tax, maybe there is no harm in proceeding under 1346.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm helping you.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is no harm in proceeding under 1346 once the money is paid because you're dealing with a simple refund action. You're not dealing with trying to stop a foreclosure suit or stop a levy. You're dealing with a simple foreclosure action.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but there may be situations where the Government, having levied, doesn't feel the need to pursued other remedies available to it. And if you then allow a challenge to the levy to come in later the person they would have proceeded against if they didn't have the levy may have left the country, may have dissipated the funds that they would otherwise go after. They need to know early on that they are barking up the wrong tree if they have levied on the wrong property, and that's why you have a short statute to clear that up as soon as possible.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, there is rationale for having a short statute, but once again I point out that you have two statutory schemes which appear to be able to be harmonized and coexist together. 1346 constitutes or at least the language is clear and unequivocal in its waiver of sovereign immunity for a third party who desires to collect a tax that's been taken from that third party. And with that construction, it seems to me that only Congress can -- can deal with the question that you've just raised, if Congress wants to make it.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- the, the statute that you point to talks about taking a civil action against the United States. When there has been a wrongful levy, is that right?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ 7426.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't say an injunctive action. So I would reading it think it encompasses both actions for injunctions, which are rare, probably, and what I think is not rare at all, an action for damages or money back. Now your reading of the statute takes that whole ordinary case, where people are just suing to get back some money, and it says our nine-month statute of limitations here is meaningless. All it applies to are injunctive actions which I bet are far and few between. You can tell me I'm wrong on that.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37746 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I won't say you've made it meaningless but you have eviscerated it. Is that fair?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37747 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer, it is fair. And it's fair for this reason, that in the Williams case the very --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37748 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, is my characterization fair? (Laughter.)
05-1541 +++$+++ 37749 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You want to say no to that. (Laughter.)
05-1541 +++$+++ 37750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In the Williams case, the very same argument was raised, that 7426 would be rendered meaningless if, and other, the quiet title action and other actions would be rendered meanings less if 1346 was construed to allow Mrs. Williams to have a third party action.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why would it have? Because there I think we are talking about liens and it doesn't cover liens, the specifics statute.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Government contended that Mrs. Williams had remedies available to her, certainly not a levy, because there was no levy, but the Government was contending she could have sought relief under the Quiet Title Act. She could have sought relief by posting --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the Government -- and the opinion points out that if she had gone the quiet title route she would have lost the advantageous -- she would have had to make. She could never complete a quiet title suit within the time that she needed to execute this sale.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, I, I know you've found that in the opinion. But at the same time I'm pointing out that the Government was contending that the Quiet Title Act was available to Mrs. Williams, and also that she could have simply put the money up. And -- put the money up, and the land would have been released and there was an argument over whether the secretary would have discretion to turn her down. But the point is there were other remedies out there, and they were not deemed --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37755 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the, and the opinion suggests -- not merely suggests, determines -- that those other remedies, unlike 7426 in cases where it applies, were ineffective. The Government raised other remedies and the Court said they were ineffective.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37756 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The other remedies I understand were determined to be not meaningful in the opinion of the Court. But I'm pointing out that argument was raised and rejected. And it was rejected because, because 1346 as I understand it has a life of its own, so to speak, and it was construed to be an unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity. And I return to my original buoyant that if that is the case then the two statutes most coexist together. Mr. Chief Justice, if there are no further questions I would like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Counsel. Ms. Maynard.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37759 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. When Congress creates a specific remedy for a specific situation that remedy forecloses resort to a more general remedy when that general remedy would frustrate the purposes of the specific remedy.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you have a citation for that as would apply to the Internal Revenue code?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. The A.S. Kreider decision that we discuss in our brief is about was whether or not the sorter statute of limitations, ironically, in the case for refund suit, applied, rather than the broad general Tucker Act statute of limitations. And this Court held that the specific controlled over the general because Congress was entitled to provide more specifically in a particular situation when the need called for it.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was, was the more specific statute there enacted after the more general statute?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Both of those statutes, it's been a long time, Your Honor. I'm not, I'm not totally --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The reason I ask is we -- we do have a principle which I think is a sound one, that repeals by implication are not fatal. And what you're saying is that the enactment of the more narrow statute impliedly repeals the cause of action that existed under 1346. Do you know if any of your cases that you cite, even those outside of the Internal Revenue field, involve more specific statutes enacted after the general statute that they supposedly limit?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not sure if they answer that precise question, but --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I guess --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the implied repeal analysis is not the proper analysis to apply here, because the proper principle is that the specific remedy forecloses resort to the more general remedy, when two things are true.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's certainly true when the two are enacted at the same time, obviously. Or even when the, when the general is enacted after the more specific one and does not thereby limit the more specific one. But, well --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In -- in this Court's case, if I can answer your, the principle of your question, Your Honor, which is that the replied repeal doctrine is not the proper analysis here because the specific controls the general.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If 7426 had not been enacted, wouldn't this case have fallen within 1346 as interpreted by Williams.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we would certainly have a more difficult argument here if that were the case, Your Honor. But Williams' specific withholding was -- didn't answer the question at issue here, because it only held that a person who had been subjected to a lien, involuntarily paid it under duress, could be a taxpayer within the meaning of 1346. But it didn't answer the question here, which is whether or not when Congress has provided specifically for parties in Petitioner's situation and created a remedial scheme that would be wholly frustrated --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What could you point to in the language of 1346 that would take this case outside of 1346 as interpreted in Williams?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That would be a difficult argument to make, that it doesn't fall within the erroneously or illegally collected tax. But that was the same case in A.S. Kreider. That was the same language in A.S. Kreider, the erroneously collected tax. Yet the Court held that the more specific refund statute of limitations there applied.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if this case would have fallen within 1346 as interpreted by Williams until -- then you must be arguing that 1346 was in part impliedly repealed when 7426 was enacted.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ One can look at it that way, Your Honor. But I think if one looks at it that way then I think this Court's cases in Brown and Block are how you apply the implied repeal analysis when a specific statute would be wholly fully frustrated by application of a more general statute. And that's particularly true where it's uncertain at the time Congress enacted the specific statute.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't, I don't see how you can say there's frustration. Perhaps I'm missing something. It seems to me that for years the Revenue Code has had two basic schemes. One is you can contest the liability before you pay the money. The other is you pay the money and sue for refund. And one requires you go to the Tax Court and the other district court and so forth. So these are two different schemes and here you have to -- we are advised that even if there was a levy for $100,000 you, couldn't contest it unless you paid the extra 900. So those are two very different schemes. Am I wrong about that?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they are two very different schemes, Your Honor, and one is for the situation that Petitioner faces, which is a third party whose property is levied upon to collect the taxes of another, and it has its own venue provisions, its own jurisdictional provisions, its own short statute of limitations. Importantly, however --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course, because the Government doesn't have the money. But in the refund suit the Government has the money.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, Your Honor. In a levy suit the Government often does have the property.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Often does, but not necessarily, and doesn't have to have all the amount.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not -- I think, Your Honor, the Flora requirement, which is a judicially interpretation on the refund statute which requires you, a taxpayer to pay all of its tax liability for a given year before it can bring a refund statute challenge, actually supports our argument here because it shows how complicated it would be to apply that scheme when you're talking about a party who doesn't owe the tax. We haven't -- the Government has not assessed the tax against the trust here. It believes the trust is a nominee or alter ego of the taxpayer and the -- the wrongful levy statute has a short statute of limitations for the precise reason that if we seize the property of the trust the Government needs to know promptly if the trust claims it's not the taxpayer's property because the Government, as the Chief Justice indicated, will cease going after the taxpayer if it believes it has already collected the tax from someone else that it believes to be holding the money for the taxpayer, which is different and crucially different than in a refund suit, as Justice Stevens alluded to, because in a refund suit where the taxpayer brings the challenge and has paid the tax, at the end of that suit either the Government has to pay the money back to the taxpayer in a refund or the Government gets to keep the tax and that's the end of the matter. In a third party challenge, whether the third party brings it pre- deprivation or post-deprivation, the Government's interest is knowing whether or not the third party has taxpayer property or not. Because if it turns out that it's not the taxpayer's property the Government needs to pursue the taxpayer. And Congress accounted for that not only in 7426 by the short statute of limitations, but also for the expression suspension of the Government's period of time that it can pursue the taxpayer. The, the section 7426 expressly suspends the time period during the running of a third party challenge whether that's pre or post deprivation. In addition, the -- if I can go back to Justice Scalia, I would like to impress upon you why we don't believe the implied repeal doctrine is applicable here, and not only is it because the specific controls the general when it would be wholly frustrated as it would be here by both the statute of limitations provision and its express suspension, but also because the availability of the general remedy was uncertain at the time that Congress passed -- and for the purposes of the implied repeal doctrine that's the proper analysis: What did the 1966 Congress think it needed to say in order to make this the exclusive remedy? The state of the law at the time --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Pre-Williams you're talking about?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37783 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, in 1966, Your Honor. The state of the law at the time when the Congress was deciding how to write this provision, there was certainly no authoritative pronouncement that, that the, that third parties could bring a suit, and indeed the law that --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37784 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why does that make your argument stronger? If Congress didn't think that 1346 applied, then surely it didn't intend to repeal it.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the cases say it matters what the Congress saw at the time it passed the statute in Brown and Block. But the reason it does matter as a logical matter is that the state of the law was such that third parties couldn't bring a refund suit under 1346. The actions that had been allowed, Your Honor, were against the IRS officials and those were expressly replaced by the statute. Congress expressly replaced them in section 7426(d) and (e), which is on 12a of our, of our petition. So that shows that Congress did intend to make this the exclusive remedy. The other reason why I think you can --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did you make that argument, did the Government make that argument, in Williams?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did we make the argument in Williams?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, that -- that Congress had enacted another statute which presumes that there is no cause of action under 1346?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the Government conceded in Williams that 7426 was not available to Ms. Williams there because she had only been subjected to a lien, not a levy. So the remedies the Government was pointing to in that case as exclusive of the 1346 remedy were the quiet title action and a discretionary --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but even if it wasn't available to her, the fact that there was another statute the whole premise for which is the unavailability of a remedy under 1346, it seems to me that would have, that would have strengthened the Government's case in Williams.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we did point to the statute, Your Honor, and suggest that the Congress had made it available. I think the other reason why the implied repeal doctrine is not the right analysis here is that section 7426 did not withdraw any substantive rights. This, the trust here is simply trying to take advantage of another remedial provision, 1346, and rename its cause of action. They're bringing exactly the same -- their complaint is substantively identical to the complaint they brought in their first action.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It looks like it's the same in the Kreider case. I can't tell, I don't know. But this case was a specific statute of limitations acted after the general refund statute, right?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's right, Your Honor.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And in the prior case it seems to be a specific statute that was enacted in 1926. I just got it out of the library. They give it to us, you know, if you ask them.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Bless them, Your Honor. (Laughter.)
05-1541 +++$+++ 37796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it was the 1926 code and it concerned 1926 income, so it must have been brought, the suit, fairly close to when that was enacted. And the general provision was a general judicial code provision having to do with general statute of limitations and, no, it doesn't say. It looks -- I mean, it sounds as if that had been long in existence.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37797 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I believe it had been. It was a Tucker Act provision. Thank you. That would be the answer to your question, Justice Scalia. But in direct response to the question you started with, Justice Breyer, Congress -- the general statute of limitations for refund actions did already exist. In fact, the Government believes it's significant when Congress passed 7426, instead of referring to that specific provision, it placed in the same section of the code a shorter statute of limitations specifically for these actions. It created a new subsection and said 7426 actions must be brought within 9 months.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37798 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So why was it so hard for them to say that this is an exclusive remedy, as they have done in other situations?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37799 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As I indicated, Your Honor, at the time there was no authoritative pronouncement. If even --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37800 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's even all the more reason for them to say. I mean. If there's confusion about what remedies are available and they want it to be exclusive, it's easy enough to say that.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37801 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the remedies that have been allowed by the courts, Your Honor -- and we believe, in the absence of any appropriate waiver -- but the actions that have been allowed have been allowed against IRS officials, and Congress did expressly replace those, on 12a, in 7426(d): "No action may be maintained against any officer or employee of the United States."
05-1541 +++$+++ 37802 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, again that suggests that they know how to spell out exclusivity when they have it in mind, and they didn't do it with respect to the availability of an action under 1346.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37803 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's true, Your Honor. But I think for purposes of trying to discern the intent of the 1966 Congress one has to look at the state of the law in 1966. And there was no reason to believe and certainly no authoritative pronouncement at the time that 1346 covered this type of action, and I don't think --
05-1541 +++$+++ 37804 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So the Williams decision came like a bolt out of the blue, then?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37805 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's probably how the Government viewed it, Your Honor. But certainly I don't think one should ascribe for purposes of implied repeal, in other words to assume a presumption, by making the Congress prescient of what this Court was going to decide in 1995. And I certainly wouldn't concede, although the Petitioner would like to argue, that Williams' holding is as broad as it is. Williams was about a very particular situation, a woman, as I said, who had a lien placed on her, and the Court didn't answer this question of whether someone who had, as Justice Ginsburg indicated, who had a levy placed on there, could be a taxpayer within the meaning of 1346 as this Court held in Williams. Justice Kennedy, also on your question about the tax code, although we don't cite it in our brief, Estate of Ramani is another case in which this Court had in effect held that a specific provision in the tax code, in this very Tax Lien Act, took priority over a more general provision that had to do with the priority of the United States' claims. And that's Estate of Ramani, 525 U.S. 517. I believe if there are no further questions, the Government would ask the Court to find that 7426 is the -- except I have one more thing to add. Getting lots of help today from all quarters.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37806 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Hungar has a further question.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37807 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I beg your pardon?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Hungar has a further question. (Laughter.)
05-1541 +++$+++ 37809 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He wants me to point out to the Court that, in addition to -- it's always nice to have help. In addition to the great American Federal Savings & Loan case, Justice Scalia, which indicated that the implied repeal analysis is not appropriate when you're talking about a subsequent simply remedial provision that doesn't withdraw substantive rights, the Court in a case authored I believe by Your Honor, Rancho Palos Verdes, in footnote 2 made that same point last term.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37810 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I forgot about that footnote. (Laughter.)
05-1541 +++$+++ 37811 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MS. MAYNARD +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Hungar might have questioned your memory. If there are no further questions, we would ask that the Court affirm.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37812 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ainsa, you have 5 minutes remaining.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37814 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Government argues that A.S. Kreider has relevance to this case and I will submit to the Court that it does not. The analysis in A.S. Kreider about a more specific statute following a general statute controlling was based upon the peculiar syntax of the statute in question. The analysis in A.S. Kreider was that the more general statute was phrased in the negative and that therefore all it did was set an outside time limit that Congress was free to shorten with a subsequent statute. We do not have that situation in this case. There was -- there is no similar analysis that you can apply to 1346 and 7426.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And both statutes in Kreider I take it applied to the refund suit?
05-1541 +++$+++ 37816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So there were two statutes bearing on the same remedy.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. AINSA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Two statutes bearing on the same remedy. And I submit that the A.S. Kreider analysis is not relevant here. The Government ALSO relies on Brown versus the General Services Administration for the proposition that a very detailed, complete, balanced, structured statute will control over a more general statute, and the argument is of course that 7426 is that type of statute. But the problem is in the Brown case we were dealing, the Court was dealing, with the Civil Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act was clearly the first piece of legislation that had been enacted by Congress to remedy Federal employment discrimination. It was a brand new remedy. In the case before the Court today, 7426 was a response to a particular issue that was raised in 1966 and that was that claimants who desired to seek redress from the Government when their property was taken were suing the director. They were suing the tax collector. This was just a statute to give them a remedy directly against the Government. It wasn't creating a brand new situation. It was clarifying that now you could sue the Government directly as opposed to the tax collector. And in fact, the Federal Tax Lien Act prohibited suits against Government officials, as was previously the practice in the United States. And so it's, this issue of implied repeal with the shorter statute I don't believe is apropos to the situation that confronts us here. And I would like to also simply conclude my argument with regards to the Government's contention that the Government needs to know. In this particular case the tax years in question were 1981 through 1984. The Government did not assess the taxpayer until 1993 and 1994, 12 years after the first tax year. The government did not levy until 1999, which was 18 years after the first tax year. During this time the Government knew, very clearly knew, what the situation was in this case and for whatever reason did not take prompt action. Therefore, on behalf of the Petitioner, I ask that you reverse and send this case back to the district court for proceedings under the refund statute.
05-1541 +++$+++ 37819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Ainsa. The case is submitted.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37824 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in 05-1575, Schriro versus Landrigan. Mr. Cattani.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37826 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Ninth Circuit's rejection of a reasoned State court factual determination and decision is improper under any deferential standard of review, and it is particularly improper under the highly deferential standard of review required under the AEDPA. This morning I'd like to try to develop three -- three points. First, the State court's factual finding that Landrigan instructed his attorney not to present any mitigating evidence was not an unreasonable finding and, in fact, is the most logical interpretation of the record. Although Landrigan now argues that the record does not show whether his decision not to present mitigation evidence was knowing or voluntary, that is not a claim that was ever developed in State court. He never alleged in his State post-conviction proceedings that that, his decision to do that was not knowing or voluntary. Secondly, an evidentiary hearing is unwarranted in this case --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask about the first one? Does the Constitution require there be no involuntary?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would require that it would be knowing and voluntary, yes.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So if the record showed that he didn't get, there wasn't a procedure followed to voluntarily waive those Constitutional rights, wouldn't the district court be able to reexamine that?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there's no colloquy requirement for a defendant to waive presentation of mitigation. And I think it would have been enough if the defendant or defense counsel had simply said my -- if the attorney had said my client has instructed me not to present any mitigating evidence, and that would be adequate. If a defendant chooses to make a claim that his waiver was not knowing or voluntary, the burden would shift to him to do that in a post-conviction proceeding, and he did not do that in this case.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How would he make such a claim in this case where in open court he was asked by the judge, right, with nobody twisting his arm, whether it was the case that he did not want any mitigating evidence introduced? And he said, right, yes, that's correct?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I agree, Your Honor. It would be very difficult for him to make that argument and I suspect that's why the argument was not raised in the State post-conviction proceeding.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't know if you got to the third point you were going to make. You were outlining three different points. But it seems to me that from the very start, what happens is that you and your brother for the respondent are talking past each other. You want to talk to us about the adequacy of the State court's finding. The respondent says what we -- all we want is a hearing in the district court, and those are two different issues. We want a hearing in the district court, i.e., so that we can show the findings are insubstantial or incorrect. Those, it seems to me, are two different issues, and I sense the briefs are talking past each other on this point. Did you see the same thing?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I did, Your Honor, and I think the reason for that is, in our view an evidentiary hearing is not necessary because the factual finding by the State court obviates the need for one. An evidentiary hearing would be developing evidence that would never have been presented. Given this factual finding, the State court is in effect saying no matter what counsel might or might not have developed, it would not have been presented at sentencing because this defendant specifically instructed his attorney not to present any mitigating evidence.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In your view, what is the standard for when the district court may hold an evidentiary hearing? I know there's an element of discretion in it.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A district -- the district court can order an evidentiary hearing if the defendant has been denied an opportunity to develop relevant facts necessary to resolve a colorable claim in State court. And I think here the defendant fails on two different points. First --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the only time the district court can hold a hearing?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it has to be through no fault of his own and if the facts were not developed in State court. Certainly it's the petitioner's obligation, a defendant's obligation to present these claims in State court and the only -- the reason --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but it seems that if he doesn't do that, then that's a bar. But if he has done that, when can he ask for a further hearing?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but that's the point here. He has not done that. He did not attempt to develop facts or he was not precluded from developing facts that would be relevant to a resolution of his ineffective assistance claim. If I could, Your Honor, there are two different parts of that question. First, the facts are not relevant. The facts that he's seeking to develop in an evidentiary hearing is this additional, this mitigation that should have been developed. If, in fact, his avowal that he did not want any mitigation to be presented is accurate, then these other facts are not relevant.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but isn't that the problem in your argument? Because your argument assumes, and I think you said this quite candidly a moment ago, that once there has been a finding that he informed the court that he did not want mitigation evidence presented, that in effect is a matter of -- binds him as a matter of law for all time. And what he is saying here is look, if I had known that there was this kind of mitigating evidence, as opposed to what was proffered to the court at the end of the trial in fact, I would not have made that waiver, if you want to call it that. I would not have made that representation to the court. And what I want is an evidentiary hearing to show that, to show that in fact, when I said to the court no mitigating evidence, I didn't mean this. And he wants a hearing for that. The only way it seems to me that you can properly win on the issue that he thus raises is exactly the way that I think you said a moment ago. That once there is a finding that he made a statement, whatever its predicate, a statement that I don't want any mitigating evidence presented, that is the end of the issue as a matter of law. My question is, do you have any authority for that?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Simply the AEDPA 2254(e). I don't have a specific case that also would go directly to that point. Your Honor, I would also --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37843 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Souter's question highlights an ambiguity in this Ninth Circuit opinion, for me anyway. Do you understand the hearing that they directed to be on the waiver question, or is the hearing that they directed on the alleged mitigation evidence that he now wants to present?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37844 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It seems to me the hearing is directed at presenting all of the mitigation evidence that he now wants to present.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37845 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Doesn't it have to go to both? Because I mean, he's saying look, first I want to show that there's a certain kind of mitigation evidence that was not proffered, that I didn't have in mind, that I wouldn't have objected to. And he then wants to proceed with respect to his inadequacy of counsel claim based also on the existence of this kind of evidence that counsel didn't look to. There's a dual purpose, I thought.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37846 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would agree with that, but Your Honor --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37847 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I wouldn't agree with it. I thought that the Ninth Circuit had been very clear that it did not agree with the district court's determination that he had waived mitigating evidence. I thought the Ninth Circuit simply disagreed with that finding and remanded for a hearing on the mitigating evidence.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37848 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37849 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't that so? I mean, that's what that -- one of the reasons the case was here, that the Ninth Circuit simply smacked down a district court factual finding that he had waived any mitigating evidence. Isn't that what happened?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37850 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37851 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So it wasn't remanding for a hearing on whether he had waived mitigating evidence. It made the determination that he had not waived it, and then remanded for investigation into what that mitigating evidence would be.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37852 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know that it's completely clear as to what the Ninth Circuit is saying can be developed and how that evidence can be used.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37853 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's clear at least that they disagreed with the finding of the district court that there had been a waiver, no?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37854 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right, Your Honor, and I think --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37855 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So it's clear that they disagreed that the finding was necessarily dispositive. Is anything clear beyond that? I mean, I guess I'm hesitant to say I'm raising the same question that the Chief Justice did, about the ambiguity of what the court did. I mean, there's no question that they found that the -- the State trial court's finding with respect to waiver or whatever we want to call it was not necessarily dispositive. I don't think it's clear that they found anything beyond that, but correct me if I'm wrong.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37856 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Ninth Circuit ordered an evidentiary hearing to allow him to develop whatever mitigation he's proffered in Federal court.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37857 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right. But that could have, as we said a moment ago, that could have a dual purpose. One to show the, in effect, the inadequacy or the nondispositive character of the State court's finding; and two, to show relief for inadequate assistance of counsel. And the question here is that, the immediate question is what exactly did the State court find with respect to -- oh, sorry -- what exactly did the Ninth Circuit find with respect to the State court finding? And there's no question that the Ninth Circuit assumed that the State court finding was not necessarily dispositive, but I don't know that it's clear it went beyond that, and that's where perhaps you could help me if I'm wrong.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37858 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the Ninth Circuit clearly held that the State court's determination of the facts was unreasonable. And that's the problem with its decision because if the determination of facts was reasonable, it obviates the need for any further evidentiary hearing.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37859 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, on the waiver point, let's assume that this case had not come in -- come here, and you had gone back to the district court pursuant to the order of the Ninth Circuit. Surely you would have taken the position, or you could have taken the position if the evidence developed that way, that he really knew or should have known about all this mitigating evidence and he waived. You certainly could continue to take that position in the district court.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37860 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37861 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the district court would say I now have a more full, factual record, and I make the finding that there was knowing waiver, or there wasn't.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37862 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but the point we've tried to make is that he was allowed an opportunity to develop his claim about whether his -- whether he made that statement and whether he intended to instruct his attorney not to present any mitigating evidence. He submitted an affidavit where he said, if my counsel had told me there was this evidence of a genetic predisposition to violence, I would have allowed that to be presented. The court -- there was no need for an evidentiary hearing because the court simply accepted -- accepted as true that Landrigan would have provided that testimony.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37863 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, how could the district court on remand find that there was a valid waiver when the Ninth Circuit says on A-17, the appendix to the petition, for all the foregoing reasons, Landrigan has not waived the right to assert a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37864 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think you're correct. The Ninth Circuit has specifically found that the determination of facts was unreasonable and found that Landrigan has established a colorable claim of ineffective assistance.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37865 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it has not waived. Not that the district court was -- didn't have enough evidence before it. It says the foregoing, Landrigan has not waived the right to assert a claim for effective assistance. So how can you possibly say that that question is still open?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37866 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37867 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The district court has to accept that he hasn't waived. And what it's sent back for is for all of the facts that show -- that show he had ineffective assistance of counsel.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37868 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me ask this question. It seems to me that there are two separate parts to the waiver issue. One, did he intend to say I don't want to put on any mitigating evidence? But then the second part of the question is, was that statement made knowingly and voluntarily, just as a guilty plea or something like that has to be. So is it enough for you to say it's clear what he intended, or is it also part of your burden to say that that intent was expressed in a way that was knowing and voluntary, compliant with the rule that applies to waivers of constitutional rights?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37869 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it's clearly enough simply to say that, as I indicated, even if it had just been an avowal by the attorney that this defendant has instructed me not to present mitigating evidence, that that would be enough.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37870 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that a sufficient waiver without inquiring as to whether it was a knowing and intelligent waiver, that he knew what he could put in, and so forth and so on?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37871 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, it is, Your Honor. I think to the extent that the defendant wants to raise that, he can raise that in a State post-conviction proceeding. He should make that type of argument in the post-conviction proceeding. And that's not what he did here. An analogous situation is that -- came up in a case that the defense, that Landrigan has cited, Iowa versus Tovar. And this Court expressly noted that the time to raise a claim -- that case involved whether it was a counsel -- it was a decision to waive counsel at a plea proceeding. And this Court noted that the time to raise that is in a post-conviction proceeding, and that the burden shifts to the defendant to raise that issue. And here if you look at the, the petition for post-conviction relief, if you look at the affidavit that Mr. Landrigan submitted, there, there is nothing in there that suggests that "I did not understand what I was doing when I instructed my counsel not to present mitigation. I, I did not understand the concept of mitigation." There's nothing in there to suggest that. So I would --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37872 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't there something that, isn't he saying implicitly Justice Souter implicitly "I didn't have this kind of evidence in mind; if I had been aware of this kind of evidence, I wouldn't have given that instruction?" So he is, it seems to me, implicitly saying well, my waiver was not knowing, in the sense that I understood there was this kind of evidence and intended to preclude its introduction? Isn't that clear?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37873 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's clear he is saying that I would have permitted one type of mitigating evidence.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37874 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's the same thing, isn't that the same, a way of saying that to that extent my waiver was not knowing?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37875 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He, he's raised to it that extent as to that particular piece of mitigation. And the trial court is expressly saying I disbelieve you when you say you would have allowed presentation of that mitigation.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37876 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And he's saying if you will give me a hearing, district court, I will try to demonstrate to you why, why the State court's finding on that point was unreasonable. The State court made that finding based on its observation of me at trial and, and at the sentencing phase; but it didn't give me a, a further chance to develop my evidence on, on post-conviction. And I want a hearing to develop that evidence in front of you, Federal district court, in order to prove that the State court's finding in light of that evidence was unreasonable. Isn't, isn't it correct that that's what he's asking for now?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37877 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He is, Your Honor, but I would suggest that there is no further evidence that was presented that he was attempting to present in State court regarding whether his waiver was knowing or voluntary.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37878 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How would -- how do we know that?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37879 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do we know we know that? Because of the, the affidavit he submitted. And he, he's required to submit an affidavit to establish a colorable claim. And, and he's required to allege in his post-conviction petition that his waiver is not knowing or voluntary. But the burden is on the defendant --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37880 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you, I don't think you mean this, but you're not arguing that he just omitted the magic words not knowing and voluntary?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37881 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think, I don't think he just omitted them. I think he was not raising that claim.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37882 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, but, I thought a second ago you -- you admitted that to a degree he was, because he is saying implicitly if I had known about this kind of mitigating evidence, I wouldn't have waived. Therefore, my waiver was, as to this, not a knowing waiver.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37883 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He raised that as to that one aspect of mitigation. But it would have been very simple for him, a simple matter for him to argue I didn't understand the whole concept of mitigation. I didn't understand what I was doing.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37884 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Look, it would have been a better affidavit, it would have been better pleading. We can stipulate to that. But is there, I don't see there is any serious question that he is arguing right now that as to this kind of evidence, had I known about it I wouldn't have waived and therefore, I shouldn't be precluded from, from getting it in now. And, and if there's no question about that, then -- then I think we're just fighting about words.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37885 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think the issue was resolved by the State court's factual determination that Landrigan was not credible even in making that assertion that I would have allowed presentation of genetic predisposition of violence.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37886 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And he says in the district, he says in the district court: I want a hearing to show that I was credible. So credible that the State court finding should be seen as an unreasonable resolution of a factual issue. I want a hearing. That's all he's asking for, isn't it?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37887 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would just suggest that there is no further evidence other than putting Landrigan on the stand to say --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37888 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's pretty good evidence, isn't it? I mean, he may be a believable witness on this point. I don't know.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37889 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't think there was any need for an, for the trial court to put Landrigan on the stand having already presided over Landrigan's trial and sentencing.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37890 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If he wants, if he wants a hearing on that, we'd have to reverse the Ninth Circuit, right? Because the Ninth Circuit held that he didn't waive --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37891 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37892 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- this claim?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37893 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37894 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The part of the opinion that Justice Alito quoted on page A-17.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37895 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That, that's right, Your Honor. And I think that's why this case should be relatively straightforward. Because the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit's finding, that the State court unreasonably found that, that Landrigan expressly instructed that his attorney not present any mitigation, given that -- that's the problem with the Ninth Circuit's opinion. Everything else builds on top of that. If that's an incorrect holding, then the rest of the ruling is, is incorrect.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37896 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Even if it is incorrect, if we -- we don't know precisely what he meant by the words he said, why doesn't that argue even more strongly for a hearing? At the hearing he wants to introduce, doesn't he, his stepparents, or foster parents, a school teacher, the various others? And he'll say anyone who listens to those people will see that I have the most horrendous upbringing anyone could have. The worst you've ever heard. And my argument is that if only my lawyer had looked into this at that moment in the trial, he would have said in the sentencing proceeding, look what I can present for you. And if he had done it and told me that, anyone would have said, "of course, present it." And I want a chance to show that that's true of my case. Now, why shouldn't he have a hearing on that? No hearing was given him in the State court.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37897 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the problem with, that Your Honor, is that he didn't ask for, for a hearing to present testimony from, for example, his biological mother and his ex-wife, who would have presented the very evidence --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37898 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In State court he didn't.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37899 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In State court in the --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37900 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I mean, is the requirement such that when you ask for a hearing in a State court on a general matter, "I would like to show through a hearing," then he gives a whole lot of affidavits of the kind of thing he's going to produce, that then the State says "no," you go into Federal court and say "I'm roughly going to do the same thing, I have a few extra witnesses, some of the people say some extra things," no, you can't do that?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37901 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there is a requirement in State court that you plead with specificity what type of claims you're raising in a post-conviction --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37902 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Didn't he say my claim is ineffective assistance?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37903 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Ineffective assistance --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37904 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yeah. Because he didn't investigate to discover the horrendous circumstances in which I was raised, and had he done it, he would have found roughly this kind of thing, and I would like to show that he should have done that because it would have changed the result?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37905 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, his argument at State court was not that he didn't investigate that; his argument in the post-conviction proceeding was he could have presented that through some other witnesses. The -- his argument at the trial -- at the post-conviction --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37906 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's not what I understood his argument that he wants to raise to be. In his affidavit, it is a different argument. It is the biological component of violence. "Look, my grandfather was convicted, my father was convicted," and so the mitigating evidence he wants to present at sentencing that is I'm biologically predetermined to commit crimes.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37907 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The criminal gene argument.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37908 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- which is certainly an ambiguous argument to present in mitigation at a sentencing hearing.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37909 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Certainly. And that is, that is the main point I'm trying to make is that that was the only thing he was asserting in his post-conviction proceeding, was that "I would have liked have raised this argument that I'm generically predisposed to violence." The rest of the argument I think would have been frivolous because it was so obvious that he had restricted, he had limited his counsel's, restricted his counsel from presenting the very type of evidence that we're talking about now, this other type of evidence.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37910 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought all that evidence was basically before the district court anyway. Didn't the district court know about all of that when it made its ruling?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37911 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor and the trial court knew about it when it made its ruling.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37912 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the district court had a proffer, but the district court but had not heard witnesses, it had not heard evidence.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37913 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But, but the focus here is on the reasonableness of the State court's factual finding.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37914 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure, but the reasonableness of factual findings depends on what the evidence is that can go in on the issue of reasonableness. And there's a universe of difference between a proffer of evidence which the district court says "well, I'll assume that," on the one hand, and on the other hand, the actual presentation of witnesses perhaps including Landrigan himself, which the court actually hears. You know, you, sometimes you get a lot more impressed by real evidence than by assumptions you make for the sake of argument. And that seems to me a world of difference.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37915 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't necessarily disagree except that we're -- the focus has to be on what the claim was that was raised in the State post-conviction proceeding; and --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37916 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The only thing, but the -- the -- I guess on that point, my only, my only reason for raising this with you is on that point, it's not enough to say well, the district court assumed this. Or for that matter, the State trial court assumed this. That is not the same thing as putting in the evidence.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37917 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Except in this case we certainly had the trial court that presided over the sentencing and had seen Landrigan in person and was uniquely qualified to make a credibility assessment regarding the points that Landrigan made in his affidavit, that "I would have allowed presentation of genetic predisposition."
05-1575 +++$+++ 37918 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask what might be an awfully elementary and stupid question? But -- it seems to me that there's no question about the facts of what he said. And you can interpret him saying I don't want any mitigating evidence put it. But isn't it clear that the waiver of the right to put in any mitigating evidence at a capital sentencing hearing is a constitutional right of very important dimensions? And can that right be waived if the record does not show whether or not he knew the full right of -- that is available to every defendant in a capital case? Namely, he had been advised by his counsel he could put in all sorts of stuff. Is there anything to show that there was that kind of waiver here, on the face of the record?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37919 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There, there's not a specific colloquy that goes through --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37920 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then it is, as a matter of law, an ineffective waiver. Isn't the Ninth Circuit dead right, not factually, but just as a matter of law, that you cannot waive this right unless the record shows that he's fully advised of the scope of the right that he's waiving.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37921 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, first, there's no authority that I'm aware of that would require any type of a specific colloquy. I think this record --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37922 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's new to me also. I never heard of it.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37923 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I think that would be --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37924 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But why should it be, why should there be a less complete colloquy for this kind of waiver than a guilty plea itself? Now I admit there's no authority on the point. But isn't it absolutely obvious?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37925 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think the reason there's no need for one is because a defendant can come in and if he really believes that his waiver was not knowing and voluntary, he has an opportunity to pursue that type of claim in a post-conviction proceeding. And he can come in and proffer whatever evidence he wants to proffer if, in fact, that's his claim, that he didn't understand --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37926 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Some kind of waivers, like waiver to the right to counsel, we do indeed require a colloquy, because a defendant is not likely to know what consequences of foregoing counsel are. So the judge discusses with him and, you know, points out what a -- what a significant decision that is. But it doesn't take a whole lot of smarts to answer yes or no to the question, you know, "do you agree that your counsel should not introduce any mitigating evidence?" I mean, it's clear on, on its face.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37927 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would agree, Your Honor. And I think --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37928 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But doesn't that assume that the defendant know what mitigating evidence is? I mean, this defendant, I suppose wants to show, "I thought mitigating evidence was just going to be what the, these two relatives were going to testify to. There was really much more, if my counsel had investigated." And that's not a knowing waiver.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37929 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that type of argument was belied by what, what happened at the time of sentencing.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37930 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, unless the argument is, and maybe this is what the other side its going to argue, that -- that when you make waiver of all mitigating evidence, knowing as any person knows who's reached that far in the criminal process what mitigating evidence is, you must know, in fact, all of the elements of mitigation that could have been introduced. Which will almost never be the case. So that it's always possible after waiving the right to introduce mitigating evidence to come into the court a year later and say, "Oh, my goodness, here's the sort of mitigating evidence I didn't know about at the time. My grandfather was a criminal. I didn't realize that at the time. And now I want" -- you know -- "therefore my waiver was uninformed" and, you know, we go back to square one and try the case again. That would always be possible, wouldn't it?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37931 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I agree, Your Honor. And it's because the nature of mitigation is so open ended, it would be difficult to explain precisely and have a waiver of every conceivable item of mitigation.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37932 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And so are you, are you in effect then saying that the waiver does not need to be a knowing waiver in the sense that it needs to be based upon an appreciation of all the possible mitigation evidence that in this case might come in? Are you saying it need not be knowing in that sense?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37933 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think a defendant needs to understand the nature -- the basic nature and concept of mitigation. But this case provides a good example --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37934 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you're not answering my question. I -- we all agree that he needs to understand the basic concept of mitigation. Does his waiver have to be a knowing one in the sense that I just described? Or doesn't it? What's your position?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37935 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It does have to -- it does not have to be knowing as to every conceivable aspect of mitigation.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37936 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it will nonetheless kind him if he comes in later and says look, I accept the fact that it's my burden to show at this point that my waiver was not a knowing one, and that there us mitigating evidence that I would have let in? Are you saying that he simply as a matter of law cannot say that? Or cannot be heard to say that?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37937 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ He is bound by that, Your Honor. And if I could --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37938 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So -- so the answer to my question is yes?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37939 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37940 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As a matter of law, he cannot do what he is trying to do here?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37941 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37942 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37943 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And Your Honor, l think here we have a situation where the defendant is now trying to proffer evidence that is inconsistent with what counsel was trying to present at the time of sentencing.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37944 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you are -- what you are saying is that it was sufficient when he said, I don't want my lawyer to introduce mitigating evidence, and the trial court said, do you know what that means, and he said yes?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37945 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37946 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That doesn't have to be fleshed out at all, unlike a Rule 11 colloquy. To see if he really understands? Do you know what that means, and he yes and that's the end of it?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37947 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CATTANI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that is sufficient, Your Honor. And again, here he's now raising this claim of genetic predisposition. The sentencing memorandum that counsel submitted attempted to pore Landrigan as someone who is basically a good person who committed this crime because he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs. This new type of evidence -- and the sentencing memorandum -- and you'll see that Landrigan had been evaluated by an expert, who had said he didn't have any mental deficiencies.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37948 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Verrilli.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37950 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd like to begin by clearing up what exactly we did and didn't argue with respect to waiver and what exactly is and isn't before this Court on that set of issues in our judgment. I then would like to spend a couple of minutes on what I think the Ninth Circuit did and what effect that would have on this Court's disposition of the case. And if there's any time remaining. I'd like to turn to the question of whether we have asserted colorable claims that warrant an evidentiary hearing here, which is all that we're asking for. Now, with respect to this question of whether we pursued or didn't pursue waiver, I'm afraid counsel for the State is just wrong about this. It's important to understand how this comes up. We asserted a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, deficient performance and prejudice. The State asserted as a defense to that claim: No, no, he's waived. And the trial judge, the State habeas judge in the State court conviction ruling, agreed with that and said, well, yes, he's waived. We then filed a petition for rehearing in which we said, no, you can't rely on that defense because it's got to be a knowing and intelligent waiver under Johnson against Zerbst. That's at page 92 of the joint appendix. That motion for rehearing was denied without any further comment. We then took a petition to review to the Arizona Supreme Court. That's also in the joint appendix and I believe the page cite is 101 and 102, in which we specifically argued that you can't look to this so-called waiver as a defense to our claim of ineffective assistance because it wasn't knowingly and intent. Now, in the State's response to our petition, which unfortunately is not in the joint appendix but is in the record, the State says: No, this waiver is binding and, furthermore, you're procedurally defaulted because this procedure was decided on direct review. But the one thing the State does not say is that you raised this Johnson against Zerbst issue too late, it can't be considered. We then went to --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37951 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Excuse me. I'm looking at page 92 of the joint appendix. I don't, I don't see that.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37952 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I may have the wrong page.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37953 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's rather important, don't you think?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37954 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. I will find it for Your Honor. I'm sorry for the delay here. The motion for rehearing is, I'm sorry, 99, and on 102 is where we raise it, and then subsequently -- then subsequently we raise it --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37955 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that effective? Does the court have to entertain a motion for rehearing?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37956 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it doesn't have to, but, Your Honor --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37957 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't it your obligation to raise it in your original motion rather than in a motion for rehearing?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37958 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there's no -- but the point is that's not -- when we took this to the Arizona Supreme Court that's not an argument that the State made in opposition to our raising Johnson against Zerbst. Then when we got to the Federal district court we raised this again, this exact argument in Federal district court, and the State in Federal district court didn't object that we had failed to raise this appropriately in the State proceedings. We took it to the Ninth Circuit. They didn't raise the objection that we failed to raise it appropriately in the State proceedings. The first time that question has even been raised here is in the reply brief on the merits in this Court. And I think that's tied to the next point I want to make, which is significant, which is as the case comes to this Court the Ninth Circuit has ruled that we have met the requirements of 2254(e)(2) and are therefore entitled to an evidentiary hearing. Now, what the State is essentially saying is, well, no, you really aren't entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this set of issues because you didn't raise them adequately in the State court.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37959 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And is it just an evidentiary hearing on his biological pre determination to commit violent crime or an evidentiary hearing on the waiver question?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37960 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ On both, Your Honor.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37961 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, why did -- the court on page A-17 ruled that there was no waiver. So why would they then send it back for an evidentiary hearing on waiver?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37962 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me move to that if I could, because I do think that's significant. I think the Court has elucidated the two potential readings of the Ninth Circuit's decision. It seemed to us as we prepared this case on the merits that the reality is that the two, the issue of performance and the issue of waiver, are tied together, because if it comes out after a hearing that counsel did perform an effective job, a diligent job of performing the investigation, and did instruct the client as to what the mitigation evidence was, then you view the waiver in a different light than of course you would if the counsel hadn't. So we acknowledge here that the proper disposition of this case ought to be a remand for an evidentiary hearing.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37963 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that wasn't your assertion even in this motion for a hearing. It wasn't that he didn't know what he was giving up. It was rather the sentencing transcript, you say, "does not establish that Petitioner knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to present mitigating evidence. Rather, it shows that Petitioner gave up that right without thought, in the heat of anger, and in frustration with his attorney during that particular proceeding."
05-1575 +++$+++ 37964 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We're trying to establish there, Your Honor --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37965 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that was a factual matter best, best disposed of by the judge who was present at the time. And he didn't think it was in the heat of anger. He did think that it was a valid waiver. Now, you're raising a totally different issue. You're saying, oh, he can't waive validly without knowing all the elements of mitigation that the waiver might embrace. That wasn't the argument you were making here.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37966 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I want to respond directly to Your Honor's question, if you'll just permit me one more thought about the Ninth Circuit and I'll turn right back to that.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37967 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37968 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So in other words, we are making a more modest request for relief here which, is affirmance of the judgment sending back for an evidentiary hearing, but with a recognition that the evidentiary hearing ought to deal with the issue of waiver, which should be understood to be left open. I think we're conceding something here, that waiver ought to be left open and not definitively resolved. It's premature to definitively resolve that against the State without an inquiry. Now, turning to Your Honor's point, the -- with respect to whether there was a waiver here or not and what the State judge did or didn't do, something very significant here that I think the State's argument just overlooks. There's an assumption in the State's argument that Landrigan's conduct at the sentencing hearing itself was a waiver and considered to be a waiver. But if one looks at the transcript of that hearing, and this is D to the appendix to the petition and beginning at page D-4 -- D-3 is where the colloquy occurs where this alleged waiver happened. The very next thing that occurs, the very next thing that occurs, is the trial judge says: Okay, I want to hear from the mitigation witnesses. Then the mitigation witnesses say: Well, we're not going to testify. Then the very next thing that occurs is the trial judge says: Well, I want a proffer of what they would have said. Then when -- then when all that's said and done, the trial judge says to the lawyer -- - and this is at D-15 -- you got anything else, and the lawyer says, no, Your Honor, that's all I've got, all I've got is what's in the sentencing memo and these two witnesses. Then the judge proceeds to pass sentence. That's the -- the particularly important pages are D-20 and 21, and on those pages you will see that what the judge does is not treat Mr. Landrigan's statements as a waiver, because if she had treated those statements as a waiver what she would have said is, well, here's the aggravation case, Mr. Landrigan has waived mitigation, he has a right to do that.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37969 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is belt and suspenders, that's all. The -- I don't think any judge likes to decide a case just on the basis of waiver. This judge is saying he waived it and even if he hadn't waived it there's nothing there --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37970 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I respectfully --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37971 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- because he wasn't bringing in at this point the biological -- by the way, biological proclivity to violence is a mitigating factor rather than an aggravating factor?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37972 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me address your second question first and then your first question. I think that that in two senses does not accurately represent what this mitigation case presented to the State court and presented to the Federal court is all about. With respect even to his affidavit, which I don't think fairly under Arizona procedure can define the full scope of his claim, but with respect to that affidavit alone, what it says is not genetic predisposition. It says the "biological component of violence." That's the language that Mr. Landrigan's affidavit uses.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37973 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but the prior paragraph says it's because of the history of his biological grandfather, biological brother, and biological child. That suggests to me it's a genetic claim and --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37974 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But one other thing it does that's very significant, Mr. Chief Justice, is it also says that these witnesses can attest to the use of alcohol and drugs by the biological mother when Landrigan was in utero.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37975 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but he knew about that. He knew about that mitigating evidence at the trial because his biological mother was there.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37976 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but what he's saying that he would have agreed to, it seems to me the only fair reading in this affidavit, which again I don't think fairly defines the full scope of what he's allowed to proceed with under Arizona procedure, but with respect to this affidavit he's saying, well, if you had had an expert who could have come in and given testimony about fetal alcohol syndrome and the organic brain damage and other impairments that it causes, I would have cooperated with that. And that's really significant because if you look at page D-21 of the appendix to the petition --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37977 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How could that be helpful to him if he doesn't allow his biological mother to testify about drug and alcohol abuse? What use would the expert be if the potential predicate --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37978 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because all the biological mother would have had to do was to give that information to the expert. That's a routine matter, for experts to gather factual information and assimilate it into an expert opinion and then provide it to the court. That could have happened easily here. And I think it's very significant because on page 21 you'll see that the trial judge makes a fundamental error about this exact issue. She says: Well, I'll grant this, I'll take the mother's testimony as a proffer. I'll consider the possibility of fetal alcohol syndrome, but all fetal alcohol syndrome establishes is that the kid will also have a predisposition to addiction.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37979 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The defendant would have been happy to have his biological mother talk with the expert, but was unwilling to have his biological mother say the same thing in court?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37980 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure, and I don't think there's anything unreasonable about that. Those are very different experiences, but --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37981 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't understand. It seems unreasonable to me. He was trying to spare his mother, what, the nervousness of testifying in court? That's what he had in mind?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37982 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I -- whatever else happened, the trial judge here considered this evidence of mitigation and did a weighing. And the key point I want to make sure I make here is that therefore any evidence that this lawyer had prepared, an expert on fetal alcohol syndrome most prominently and any other evidence, the trial lawyer could have proffered at the time and had considered at the time and had weighed at the time by this trial judge. And that's a claim of prejudice, it seems to me, that even if one grants, even if one assumes -- and we dispute it and I'd like too talk about that -- but even if one assumes that there is a finding and we can't do anything about it that Landrigan would not have cooperated in the presentation of any --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37983 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Counsel, do you think it's possible to have a valid waiver of the presentation of mitigating evidence or is it always possible that some additional evidence would come up and you say, what if I had known that, I wouldn't have waived it?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37984 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think there's a yes or no answer to that question. It's something --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37985 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You can't give a yes answer to whether it's ever possible.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37986 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. Yes, it's possible. It's certainly possible.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37987 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37988 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I think I don't -- I want to make sure I don't leave any implication that the rule we're asking for here is going to open the door to lots of claims, because I don't think it does for two sets of reasons. One is a procedural set of reasons and that's the -- that, we refer the Court to the Blackledge against Allison decision -- that if -- that it's not going to be enough in every case for you to plead an adequate claim and then jump right to an evidentiary hearing. As the court said in Allison, the district court has available to it a number of tools that it can use to test the claim before granting an evidentiary hearing. So there's a limitation there. Now --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37989 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could you do it concretely, Mr. Verrilli, for this case. The defendant is being rather obstreperous and says: I don't want any mitigating evidence; I'm a really bad guy. And that's how he's trying to portray himself. What -- you said, and you allow for the possibility that there could be a knowing waiver of mitigation. What would have had to transpire in this case to make it a knowing waiver?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37990 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that's important, and hopefully it will help explain why we think that this is a narrow -- that the rule we're asking for here is a narrow one, and it's not going to open the door to lots of claims. It's clear that just like the waiver of any other fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial, the defendant's got to understand what mitigation means. He's got to understand its significance in the proceedings --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37991 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, he certainly understood that. He said if you want to give me the death penalty, bring it on, I'm ready for it. The purpose of mitigating evidence is to prevent the imposition of the death penalty. He says bring it on.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37992 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And he needs to be assisted by competent counsel. That's a consistent theme of this Court's decisions on the Johnson inquiry. And so if you have a situation in which you have documented that the client understands what mitigation is -- and frankly I don't think, with all due respect, Mr. Chief Justice, this is the kind of documentation that ought to suffice. But even if you had that, even if you documented that the defendant understood it, even if you documented that the defendant clearly waived it and documented that was done with counsel's assistance, then it seems to me it is going to be very hard for a habeas petitioner to plead something that's going to get past --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37993 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why isn't the type of documentation that would be sufficient? He understands what the consequence of not putting mitigating evidence on is going to be.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37994 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, because I think there isn't clarity at all that he understands what mitigating evidence is, what the full scope of it is and how it could --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37995 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ THE COURT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He's present in the court while they're making a proffer of this sort of mitigating evidence. The judge is quite careful, saying okay, if he doesn't want the evidence, I want to know what it is. And he called the two witnesses. And all that this defendant does is undermine his lawyer's effort to present the mitigation.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37996 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But again, Mr. Chief Justice, at the time the trial judge didn't treat that as a waiver. And so I don't think you can cut off his ability to litigate an ineffective assistance claim years later on the ground that it was an ineffective waiver.
05-1575 +++$+++ 37997 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, are you claiming that -- are you claiming that his attorney did not adequately represent him at the sentencing hearing with respect to the question of waiver? In other words, when -- that the attorney should have insisted that the judge go through some kind of more comprehensive colloquy with him about waiver and inform him of certain things about what he was giving up? Are you making that claim?
05-1575 +++$+++ 37998 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think, Justice Alito, we're making a couple of different claims, not that claim, but a couple of different claims. One is, and it pertains particularly to a mental health expert, that even if Landrigan behaved exactly the way -- at 13 -- he in fact behaved in the counterfactual world in which he had received adequate representation, that the mental health expert testimony could have been proffered to the Court, had it been prepared and developed, would have been considered, and could have made a critically important difference and for precisely the reason that Justice Ginsburg's question suggested, which is that he's obviously behaving badly in this situation. What the trial court ruled out of that is, well, he's an amoral person. What the mental health testimony would give you is an alternative frame of reference for making a reasoned moral judgment about this guy, and could be critically important in explaining that behavior. So even within the confines of accepting that the world would have unfolded exactly the way it did, it was ineffective to have dropped the ball on preparing that kind of evidence. Then it's also ineffective in --
05-1575 +++$+++ 37999 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Excuse me. I'm not following you. You mean the mental health expert's testimony could have gone to whether the judge should have accepted the waiver?
05-1575 +++$+++ 38000 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38001 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought that's what you were saying, I'm sorry.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38002 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, to the basic weighing the mitigation which the judge undertook based on all proffered evidence. Then beyond that, we're making an argument that the waiver that, even if you are going to consider that a waiver, you can't consider it a knowing and voluntary waiver, knowing intelligent waiver supported adequately by the efforts of counsel.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38003 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't that a separate question, whether it's a knowing and intelligent waiver? Isn't the question here whether he was prejudiced, which is a question of fact, which is a question of whether had he been informed of the possibility of mitigation evidence relating to a history of family violence, he would have persisted in blocking the admission of any mitigation evidence? Isn't that the issue? Not whether it was knowing and intelligent. That would be a separate legal question.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38004 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. I don't think that's the issue. With all due respect, Justice Alito, I think the test under Strickland is whether there was sufficient performance, which we think we have a very powerful record of here, and then a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different. And I think the inquiry here that the State habeas judge is undertaking is the reasonable probability inquiry. That seems to me to be a mixed question that requires --
05-1575 +++$+++ 38005 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, it's a mixed question. But if the post-conviction relief court found as a matter of fact that even had he known about the possibility of this type of mitigation evidence, he would have persisted in refusing to cooperate -- if there was such a finding, and know you dispute it -- and if you were granted a hearing, is it not true you would have to disprove that by clear and convincing evidence?
05-1575 +++$+++ 38006 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, taking our first argument to the side, our first argument which I've been discussing about what happened at the hearing, I think with respect to that argument the answer's no, that argument stands without any need to disprove the factual finding, if you assume it is a factual finding, and we don't concede that. But if it is a factual finding, then yes, we would have to disprove it by clear and convincing evidence, but we think we can do that, and all we're asking for is a hearing to enable us the opportunity.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38007 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is the standard? I ask that because I'm not certain from what I heard previously -- I think the State was saying that the only issue that was raised before the State proceeding, collateral, the State collateral post-sentencing proceeding, was that you wanted to present evidence that he had a biological gene, it's a faulty gene, something like that. When I've looked at this, it's on page 88, the motion filed says we have two claims. One claim is the claim that was just mentioned, it says that -- about it's from the biological mother, and use of drugs and alcohol.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38008 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where are you quoting from? I'm sorry.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38009 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Joint appendix A. And then there's a second one on page 88 that says in addition to failing to investigate these alternative sources, we also want to say that counsel failed to explore additional grounds, and that was the sister. And the sister was going to testify that the mother -- the foster mother, Mrs. Landrigan, abused alcohol, and she has a whole list of things in her affidavit. So is that still before us? I mean, isn't that something you want to argue?
05-1575 +++$+++ 38010 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38011 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38012 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Your Honor, for bringing us back to that question.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38013 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And then the claim would be this: You want a hearing in which you're going to present the sister, the Landrigans, what they did , what the school says, what happened to him at school, all things that are there in Affidavit 5 which was in the State court, and that the biological gene. And you want to say, am I right, I don't want to put words in your mouth, and you want to say that given all this, had this been looked into and presented to the defendant, the defendant would not have said don't present any of that, it would have been presented, and it would have made a difference. What -- is that what you want to do?
05-1575 +++$+++ 38014 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38015 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38016 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With one addition, which is this one, fetal alcohol syndrome expert testimony is very important.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38017 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right, with that too.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38018 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38019 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, what the Ninth Circuit said is, we'll give you a hearing. We don't know if you're right or wrong. What's the standard for giving you the hearing? I -- a lot of things in the law aren't always written down exactly, and I was under the impression that trial judges often give hearings on what you might call seat of the pants. I'd like to hear more about it. I've been on appellate courts where rightly or wrongly we've said, I just think I'd like to know more about this. I can't quite understand it. Let's have a hearing. And we're going to tell the trial judge to do it.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38020 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Verrilli, I thought you already conceded that the Ninth Circuit did not ask for a hearing on this question of whether he had waived, effectively waived mitigating evidence.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38021 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38022 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That isn't what the Ninth Circuit said.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38023 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but --
05-1575 +++$+++ 38024 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It found that he had not waived mitigating evidence. So what --
05-1575 +++$+++ 38025 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not actually talking about waiver. My question was just generally what I asked. What is the standard there on whether you get a hearing?
05-1575 +++$+++ 38026 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, would you permit me to answer that question, and I'll come back to Your Honor's?
05-1575 +++$+++ 38027 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Whatever.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38028 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you. The -- with respect to the standard, there are two things that we have to show and if we do, we're entitled to a hearing. One is that we're not disentitled under the analysis under Section 2254(e)(2) as explicated in the Court's Michael Williams decision, to show that the court below found it, it was not raised in the cert petition. We pointed out in the brief in opposition that it wasn't raised, it had nothing about it. That's established and the case comes to the court.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38029 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is established? That you've satisfied (e)(2)?
05-1575 +++$+++ 38030 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That (e)(2) does not apply to us proceeding to an evidentiary hearing.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38031 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why, because you satisfy it or because it doesn't apply?
05-1575 +++$+++ 38032 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because the -- there is no lack of diligence here that would trigger us meeting the heightened requirements of (e)(2), and therefore it doesn't apply to bar us. That's the theory. Now, with -- the other thing we have to show --
05-1575 +++$+++ 38033 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry, you'll just have to bear with me.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38034 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38035 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you're saying you satisfy (e)(2)(A)(ii), because there's no lack of diligence. Don't you also have to satisfy (e)(2)(B), which is to show that no reasonable factfinder would have found him guilty, in other words words subject to --
05-1575 +++$+++ 38036 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. No, Your Honor. That's -- as we understand the Michael Williams decision interpreting that provision, Your Honor, those requirements only kick in in a situation where you haven't shown diligence and therefore you're at fault, and you can overcome your fault by meeting those heightened standards. They don't apply in a situation where you have been diligent and therefore you're not -- they don't apply to you at all. With respect to the -- what else -- with respect to what else we'd have to show, we'd have to show that -- and this is the Townsend standard, which nothing has changed -- that we've alleged facts which, if proven, entitle us to relief. Those are the two things we have to show and we've done both of those things.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38037 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the district court has substantial discretion in determining whether or not to grant that hearing on that basis.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38038 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the Ninth Circuit -- and it seems to us actually, Your Honor, under Townsend in that situation the hearing's mandatory. The district court would have discretion under habeas, under habeas practice, to hold a hearing as a discretionary matter even in a situation where we haven't shown a mandatory entitlement to it. So there is discretion there.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38039 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Part of that discretion is, and you've been careful to say this, that there's a likelihood of a different result?
05-1575 +++$+++ 38040 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. Yes.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38041 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it seems to me that that is the difficult part of your case based on this evidence.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38042 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but I think -- what I think is important there is that that issue ought to be decided after an evidentiary hearing when you know what it's going to be. It's premature to decide that --
05-1575 +++$+++ 38043 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we know what the fetal alcohol testimony is going to be.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38044 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's true.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38045 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And we could make a determination or the court of appeals could make a determination or the district court could make a determination how likely that would to be affect the result.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38046 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they could, but it seems to me not until you actually hear the expert testimony, and then we have all of the other testimony that Justice Breyer detailed that you'd want to consider. I do want to try to come back, Justice Scalia, to your point. Yes, we acknowledge that the Ninth Circuit went too far in the way Your Honor described. But you don't get from that conclusion to the conclusion that you ought to grant the relief that the State is requesting here, which is a reversal and directing dismissal of the petition, because to get to that you have to show that there's no set of circumstances under which we could prevail. We're -- our position is an intermediate one, which is that the right answer here is that the judgment to send it back for an evidentiary hearing was correct and should be affirmed.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38047 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What do you do with -- following up on Justice Kennedy's question, the dissent took the position in the Ninth Circuit that the mitigating value of any proven, quoting A-24, "genetic predisposition to violence would not have outweighed its aggravating tendency to suggest that Landrigan was undeterable and even from prison would present a future danger"?
05-1575 +++$+++ 38048 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the answer is that that is an inappropriately truncated assessment of the mitigation case and a wrongly focused assessment of the mitigation case, which ought to Focus on the troubled history and the fetal alcohol syndrome, which provide a medical mental health explanation for his conduct which is quite different and that -- and so that's what ought to be balanced.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38049 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That was presented in the State court proceedings.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38050 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's not correct, Your Honor.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38051 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The biological mother's abuse of alcohol and drugs.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38052 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The fact that she used abusive -- that she abused alcohol, but not the medical expert testimony explaining what effects that would have. That's precisely the thing that wasn't there and that was the big problem. So I do think that that -- that's why we need an evidentiary hearing, to develop that. This weighing, by the way --
05-1575 +++$+++ 38053 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you think the State trial court had no familiarity with fetal alcohol syndrome?
05-1575 +++$+++ 38054 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if you look at page D-21, Mr. Chief Justice, what you'll see is actually proof in the transcript that she had no familiarity, because she said on page D-21 all it does is predispose you to being an addict yourself. But fetal alcohol syndrome is a much, much broader set of impairments that can bear directly on one's, one's moral culpability. If I could just say --
05-1575 +++$+++ 38055 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I have just one other question on a different matter. In Judge Bias's dissent, Judge Bay's dissent, he quotes a letter from the Petitioner, the Petitioner does not want to proceed with this appeal and wants the execution scheduled. Can you comment on that?
05-1575 +++$+++ 38056 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VERRILLI +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. What there was that the Ninth Circuit, upon receiving this letter, contacted counsel for Mr. Landrigan, asked him -- asked them to go visit him in prison and find out what's going on. They did so. They reported back to the Ninth Circuit that Mr. Landrigan did in fact want to proceed with the appeals. He has continued to want to proceed with the appeals, signing the IFP papers, et cetera, and it turns out there were neurological problems that were afflicting him, very serious, at the time. So that's what happened. If I could say in conclusion, just remind the Court what it said in the first Norrell decision, that even in the world of habeas there's a difference between deference and abdication. And in a situation like this one, in which the State court has not afforded an evidentiary hearing and has not allowed the development of the evidence that bears directly on Mr. Landrigan's claims, it would be a form of abdication to hold that he can be conclusively barred from proceeding further, even to an evidentiary hearing, on the basis of the present record. Thank you.
05-1575 +++$+++ 38057 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Verrilli. The case is submitted.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38061 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in 05-1589, Davenport versus Washington Education Association, and 05-1657 consolidated, Washington versus Washington Education Association. General McKenna.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38063 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Washington law authorizes union security agreements which permit unions to enter into collective bargaining agreements that require non-member employees to pay an agency shop fee or lose their job. The union's authority to select these compelled fees is based solely on statute and the subject of statutory conditions. Section 760, as adopted by Washington voters in 1992, requires unions to obtain the affirmative consent from non-members before their fees may be used to influence an election or operate a political committee. 760 serves the state's interest in election integrity by means of ensuring that union election activity is funded by voluntary contributions, just like every other organization that seeks political funds. 760 is a valid condition on the union statutory authority and does not violate the union's First Amendment rights. 760 serves the state's interests specified in the adopted initiative, which were -- which are found at petition appendix 138a codified as RCW 4217.620. Three interests in election integrity are stated, or three means of serving an interest in election integrity are stated in this portion, the intent portion of the statute. First, to ensure that individuals have a fair and equal opportunity to influence elections; second, to reduce the influence of large organizational contributors; third, to restore public trust in the election process. The Washington Supreme Court, petition appendix 22a-23a, agreed that the intent of Initiative 134 was to protect the integrity of the election process from the perception that individuals have an insignificant role to play.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38064 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm surprised that that's the -- I would have thought its primary purpose would be to spare individuals the necessity of supporting causes that they don't support. Was there no First Amendment interest.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38065 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, I --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38066 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it only an election law interest?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38067 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Actually, Justice Scalia, we believe that Section, Section 760 accomplishes both purposes. The overall intent of the initiative was as I stated found by the State Supreme Court, but clearly from the plain language of Section 760 --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38068 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you just said the State Supreme Court was wrong. I mean, why do you believe it on this if you don't believe it on everything else? You're appealing from it, aren't you?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38069 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We believe that the integrity of the election process, Justice Scalia, is in fact served by helping ensure that individuals make voluntary contributions. We think that in fact it does help the integrity of the election process, yes, sir.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38070 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, how can the State Supreme Court determine what is the purpose, the intent, of the ballot initiative?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38071 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not certain, Your Honor. They referred to the --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38072 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A lot of people voted for it.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38073 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38074 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But is the State Supreme Court in a position to determine why they voted for it?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38075 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They simply hold, Your Honor, in their opinion that this is what the voters intended.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38076 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do they know that?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38077 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know how they know it, Your Honor.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38078 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If that's what they intended, then how can a State say, well, it's the union's money, we don't want you to send this little bit of your money to contribute in a campaign, but if the local swimming team wants to, or the bar association or the corporation, if they want to spend money that people have given them for totally other purposes, the compulsory bar association, well, they can do that. It's just the labor unions that can't spend the money that these people forced to belong -- you know, they have to object affirmatively -- but all the other similar organizations, they can't.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38079 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, beginning with the Railway Labor Act case and continuing up through the public school teacher cases, Abood and Hudson, this Court has recognized that compelling employees to pay fees must be balanced against the need to protect them from --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38080 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, now you're talking about this other purpose, but that other purpose, which is rather interesting -- I take it that's one of the main points on the other side -- the other purpose has nothing to do with this case. If Washington wanted to have a similar statute where it was worried about protecting the interests of the compelled member or the compelled payor, fine, fine, that would be a different case. That isn't this case.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38081 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38082 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In this case they couldn't care less about that.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38083 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Actually, Your Honor, I think the plain language of 760 makes it clear that the authors of the initiative intended to protect individual interests. There is no meaningful distinction between the use of individuals in 760, in Section 760, than there is in the Hudson, in the Hudson statute, for example. The Hudson statute, the Illinois statute at issue in Hudson, also required nonmembers to opt in in order to make, not just political contributions but any contributions. But the Court, this Court, found no problem with Hudson or with the Illinois statute in that case.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38084 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true, but in that case, in that case they didn't have a State Supreme Court interpreting the statute which is just as you started off saying it was, which has nothing to with the rights of the nonmember, zero. It has to do with the appearance of fairness in the election.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38085 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, with due respect that was the legal conclusion of the Washington Supreme Court. It was not a construction of the statute. It was a legal conclusion based on their reading or divining of voter intend. But this Court is not bound by such an assessment.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38086 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I wanted to ask about that. Suppose Washington says that as a matter of Washington law we are bound by our interpretation of purpose and we interpret the statute according to that purpose. You use the words "plain language" a few minutes ago.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38087 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Yes.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38088 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are we free to disregard that and to say. Oh well, we're just going to follow the plain language?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38089 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, no.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38090 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Like the says that was argued, the first case this morning?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38091 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, as Chief Justice Roberts mentioned in the last case you heard this morning, first look to the plain language, as the Solicitor General has pointed out in numerous briefs --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38092 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's a Federal, a Federal statute and this is a State statute. If the State court says, we're interested in purposes, we decided, and you must as a matter of State law interpret the statute according to the purpose as we found it, aren't we bound by that?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38093 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't believe you are bound by that, Your Honor. For example --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38094 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What's your authority for that?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38095 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wisconsin v. Mitchell, Your Honor. In that case the Wisconsin Supreme Court was found by this Court not to have constructed the statute, but to have made an assessment of its practical effects, and this Court found it was not bound. Similarly in Teller, a case more directly relevant to this case, the State Supreme Court found that the Bar Association of California is a governmental agency and this Court declined to follow the State Supreme Court of California and found that in fact it was not.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38096 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's because the characterization had a Federal consequence.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38097 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I simply observed that this Court did not find it was bound by the California Supreme Court's finding that the bar association is a government agency, nor did it find in Wisconsin v. Mitchell that it was bound by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in regards to its assessment of practical effects of the Wisconsin statute at issue there.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38098 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do they get their money back? If this is upheld and I'm an agency member, I hate the union, can't stand it, gave them the $20 for this and they spent it on a political candidate I hate even more and you win, do I get my $20 back or can the union just spend my $20 on something else?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38099 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, if it is a 760 expense they should get the money back. If it is a non-760 expense which is not germane, then they would have to opt out at that -- they would have to opt out to get that kind of money back, unless Your Honor is referring to what happens on, if the statute is upheld, what happens when we go back and have a further trial on the issues in this case. I'm not sure which scenario you were envisioning, but --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm trying to get at the question is this the union's money or is this the workers', the teachers' money?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So does he get this money back if they violate the statute.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, the 760 money -- excuse me. The 760 money is not the union's money until they have satisfied the conditions laid out in the statute, in this case Section 760. Possession of the fees does not entitle the WEA or any union to use those fees to influence an election or operate a political committee until after they have satisfied the condition on that collection, the condition being in this case they have to obtain affirmative authorization. This Court held in Phillipson and Brown that, analogizing to that money, that non-members own the fees until the statutory conditions are satisfied.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38104 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let, let's assume that it makes a difference whether the purpose of the statute was at least in part to protect the First Amendment rights of the non-union members or whether, as the Washington Supreme Court seemed to say -- at least they said its principal purpose was to protect the voting process. Elsewhere in its opinion, however, the Washington Supreme Court says where a statute is ambiguous and this court is able to construe it in a manner which renders it constitutional the court is obliged to do so, which sounds to me like good law. Wouldn't that apply to its intuition as to what the intent of the people who enacted this statute were?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38105 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, sir --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38106 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wouldn't the Washington Supreme Court be obliged to intuit that purpose which would make it constitutional rather than unconstitutional?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38107 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, it would if in fact Section 760 were ambiguous. It is, however, not ambiguous. It is plain on its face, and in fact the Supreme Court did not state that any term or phrase in Section 760 is ambiguous. Instead they referred to their divination of voter intent. And I believe, Your Honor --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38108 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you agree with the court's conclusion that constitutionality is at issue here?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38109 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The constitutionality of the statute with regard to the union's First Amendment rights is not at issue here, Your Honor, no.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38110 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't it your position that this statute is constitutional either way you interpret it?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38111 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, it is. Your Honor, I'd like to make the further point that -- and I think this is a fairly obvious point, but we think that since under your decisions the State can prohibit a union from collecting an agency fee altogether, that it is reasonable for the State to impose a condition on that collection which falls, falls far short of actually prohibiting it. We further point out that in the Hudson case the Illinois statute at issue was effectively an opt-in statute, a statute under which no amount that was not germane could be collected in advance, unlike the more generous Washington State statute which allows the union, permits the union, to collect a fee in an amount equal to dues or would permit it to collect a fee which had been reduced in advance to reflect non-germane or reduced just to reflect 760 expenses. It seems to us that it is within the power of the State to establish such a condition in the interest of an election's integrity by means of protecting the First Amendment interests of the non-members, and we think the statute does that very well without imposing in fact a substantial administrative burden on the union in this case or unions in general. For example, the, the way that the WEA or any union can comply with Section 760 would be to simply place an additional form in the Hudson packet they send out. Now, recognizing that the Hudson packet is about this thick, that it is received by the teachers in September, the busiest month of the year for teachers, and that there is no form currently provided in that packet whatsoever to allow people to opt out, but rather a statement that you must send a letter to the union to opt out, we think it's quite easy. And we look to the WEA PAC for instruction on what they could do. But now. Because the WEA has chosen to form a PAC and is required to solicit members and non-members if they choose in order to contribute to that PAC, they do a very good job of soliciting members. They include a very convenient form encouraging people to check off and send their dues in to the PAC to support candidate elections. They provide no such form for the opt-out process, but it would be easy for them to do so. The burden imposed on them is not great administratively, as they suggest, any more than the burden on the other teachers unions in Abood or in Hudson because it can easily be met through these simple. If there are no further questions, Your Honor, I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38112 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, General. General Clement.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38114 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: The statute at issue here imposes only a narrow limitation on the union's use of agency fees, namely by requiring the affirmative assent of the non-members before the union may use those funds for non- germane political expenditures. The statute does not limit the union's ability to spend its own money on political causes and every avenue that is available to any other organization in the State to solicit contributions from non- members remains available to the union. The court below nonetheless struck the statute down only by treating the workers' minimum constitutional rights as a constitutional ceiling as well as a floor. In the process, the court below rigidly constitutionalized an area of labor law in which the States and the Federal Government have at least since the Lochner era enjoyed substantial discretion to make labor policy. We would request that the Court reverse the decision below, but also reverse and restore room for play in the joints in this area of labor law. I think the starting problem with the court's analysis below is that the rights that are at issue in this area principally are the rights of the individual workers. This court has recognized that agency shop itself raises significant First Amendment issues and First Amendment impingements and so the forced extraction of fees is justified only to the extent that it can be justified by the government's interest in maintaining labor peace or in avoiding free ridership. So as a minimum constitutional matter, the workers have to have an opt- out right. The question is whether the States can go further and either do an opt-in regime or do what was at issue in the Hudson case and not even allow the union to collect the non-germane funds in the first place from non-members.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38115 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Clement, if we reverse as you suggest and the State Supreme Court said, well, I guess we were wrong under the First Amendment, we just realized our State constitution requires the same result, would that judgment stand, do you think?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38116 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it might well. I mean, I think there might be an argument at that point that somehow the Federal Constitution requires more than opt-out rights. Certainly some of the amici have made that argument. The Davenport Petitioners have made that argument, and I suppose you could at that point confront a second petition in this case. But at least as a starting matter, I think that's an option that's available to the Washington Supreme Court.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Washington -- at a minimum, I would assume that the Washington Supreme Court would not have constitutional avoidance as a crutch in order to reach that, to reach that conclusion, because there is no constitutional issue here under your view.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, though I mean -- I don't mean to be able to constrain the Washington Supreme Court's ability to find a State constitutional problem that it would then think there's a need to avoid.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Are the courts in Washington State elected, do we know that? Are they elected?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They are elected.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They are elected, so it's easier to blame it on us than it is for them to say, we hold as a matter of Washington law that this can't be done and we disallow what the people have voted for. That would be harder, a harder call, don't you think?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It might be a harder call, Justice Scalia. I seem to recall a reference -- it might have actually been in the court of appeals opinion rather than in the State Supreme Court opinion -- that as a general matter the Washington courts have not construed their First Amendment, State constituent First Amendment to be radically different than the Federal Constitution. So I would imagine there's going to be some State law that may limit their ability to do that. I'm certainly not an expert on the Washington State law of the First Amendment.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, if this money is the non-union member's money and an opt-out -- I'm sorry -- opt-in scheme is not much of a burden on the unions, why should the First Amendment permit anything other than an opt-in scheme.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Scalia, it's a fair question. As I say, it's a question that's certainly raised by the Davenport Petitioners. I think there's an answer to it and I'll get to it in a minute. But I would say in fairness to Mr. -- one of the anomalies of this case is that in many respects I think that's a more difficult constitutional question than the one that the Washington Supreme Court answered adversely to Petitioners in this case. I think, if I can sketch an answer as to why it is that the opt out is the constitutional minimum and there isn't as a matter of constitutional law required to be an opt-in right, I think it goes back to what the Court has construed as the relevant First Amendment interest here. And the Court has seemingly construed the relevant First Amendment interest here in not having a compelled extraction, and as part and parcel of the constitutional violation, it seems to have assumed there's a need for a stated objection. And I think that's where you get the opt-out right. And so if you put it in the analogy, an analogous compelled speech context like Willie against Maynard and the New Hampshire license plate, in that context an important parcel of the violation is the objection to having "Live Free or Die" on your license plate. And the Court hasn't construed the compelled speech there to be that everybody has a compelled speech violation because they are presumptively forced to have the license plate on the back of their car. So I think that --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The union can make it as difficult as it wants for somebody to opt out. They can send a packet that's this thick and not provide a form.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38126 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I wouldn't think so, Justice Alito. And I think that there are two separate questions, I would think. One is, what is an adequate set of procedures and protections for exercising the opt-out right? And then a separate question would be, do you actually have to go all the way to an opt-in right? And I think that there may well be many cases where the Hudson notice that's provided doesn't provide a sufficient constitutional opportunity. I mean, you have in a case like this, a 100-page packet, I'm told, that has no -- no form in it that you're supposed to return to opt out. You basically have to go to the third page, find the address of the president of the union, and then send in a letter. And I think it's instructive if you look in the joint appendix, I think it's at page joint appendix 45, you have the form that's available to union members to opt in to PAC contributions, and have payroll deductions made for the PAC contributions. The union certainly makes it much easier to opt in to PAC contributions than it makes it to opt out vis a vis the Hudson packet.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38127 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it relevant, General Clement, that the legislature didn't seem to be, or the ballot initiative didn't seem to be focused at all on beefing up the rights of the non-member of the union? It seemed to be concerned with the integrity of the election process, because they left the same old Hudson in place for union nongermane spending that didn't have to do with elections.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38128 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's absolutely right, Justice Ginsburg, and I think the way we look at it is that this whole debate about the purpose of the provision is a little bit of a red herring, because at the end of the day it's clearly a hybrid. If you look at the text, it's hard to understand how it does not have at least the effect of protecting workers. On the other hand, you're absolutely right that it doesn't address the entirety of germane, of non-germane expenses. It addressed a subset that have the most direct impact on the election process.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38129 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or even nongermane political expenses.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38130 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true. That's true, I mean, for example, a nongermane lobbying expense which you might consider to be political in some broad sense, is not covered by the opt-in and remains subject to the Hudson opt out right. But I don't think that there is certainly anything problematic about that. It's not like the interest in protecting electoral integrity is some sort of forbidden government interest that makes this a suspicious piece of legislation. And I think at the end, if you again put the text of the relevant provision together with the overall purpose, it's clear that it's trying to protect the rights of workers but it's doing so in service of a broader intent of improving electoral integrity, and I could suggest where maybe the Washington Supreme Court went awry in its analysis, it focused almost exclusively on the three stated purposes that were included in the text of Initiative 134, which were all focused more on electoral integrity. That's not surprising, because there were 36 sections in Initiative 134 that dealt with the whole manner of different campaign finance initiatives. Before this initiative was passed by the voters of Washington there weren't any campaign contribution limits in the State of Washington. So this initiative is doing a lot more work, just besides Section 760. I think 760 isn't unrelated to those broader purposes because it does make sure that the contributions of the workers here are voluntary, and I think that is certainly something that's very similar to what Federal law accomplishes through the separate segregated fund requirements. If I could make just one note about the fact that this targets unions and not other entities, I think two points are relevant. The first is that argument was very clearly waived, and if you look at footnote 6 of the Washington Supreme Court opinion which is at 25a of the -- of the State's petition appendix, it's clear that any argument about the, the disparate treatment of unions versus corporations or other entities was not before that court.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38131 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, are there any other such entities that are given the power by the State to collect money from people against their will?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You've anticipated my second point, which is the power that's being -- I mean, it's no accident that they targeted this particular power or this particular issue because it has always been understood to be an anomaly in this area. That the unions have a right to effectively take a claim on the paycheck on people who are nonmembers of the union. These are individuals who have already opted out of union membership, and that is a sufficient anomaly and sufficiently unlike any other context that I think there is nothing that prevents the State of Washington from targeting that problem and that problem alone. If there are no further questions, thank you.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, General. Mr. West.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38135 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief -- Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Our submission that Section 760 unconstitutionally burdens the union's First Amendment right to engage in political advocacy rests on three points. One, the statute before the Court is a campaign finance law that was enacted for the purpose of protecting the public's interest in the integrity of the electoral process. Two, it is a content-based restriction on speech, which cannot be justified by the State's authority to limit agency fees in the first place. Three, the statute does not serve a compelling State interest both because it is overbroad in restricting, restricting speech on ballot propositions and because it's underinclusive in regulating the campaign speech of unions but not of other comparably situated entities.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are the First Amendment rights of the union members, of the workers who are non-union members relevant?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38137 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Uh, the First Amendment rights --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38138 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, you -- you begin by talking about the First Amendment but you, you proceed as if there are no First Amendment rights of, of workers involved at all.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the -- the nonmember employees certainly have a First Amendment right not to be compelled to finance, help finance political, ideological and other nongermane expenditures over their objection. And that right is fully protected independently of 760 by the Hudson process, and as the Washington Supreme Court held, when there is the availability of a ready means for opting out of that participation in, in financing those causes, there is no compelled speech. And this is what the, what the First Amendment gives to the nonmember fee payers.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I take it States have considerable discretion in determining how to protect Federal constitutional rights.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The States --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And absent some direction that we have to consider this as only being for a, for purposes of election transparency, it seems to me that Washington acted quite properly in saying we will use this mechanism in order to protect our workers' First Amendment constitutional rights.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what the State is protecting, Justice Kennedy, is not the First Amendment right itself which by definition is protected through the Hudson process.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38144 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, why can't the State protect it more? I mean the fact that Hudson would be adequate -- it --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38145 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The State --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- from that it does not follow that the State is not protecting the rights.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The State can certainly protect the interest that is protected by the First Amendment right more, or to a greater degree, but if it does so, it can only do so if it does not infringe on other constitutional rights. And if it does then the question is whether the State's regulation that infringes on other constitutional rights, in this case the union's First Amendment right of political advocacy, whether that infringement is justified by a compelling State interest.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And your claim as I take it, that there is an infringement with the union's right of political advocacy, is that if in effect the scheme restricts the union's use of its own funds?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The scheme restricts the, the use of funds that are, are properly collected from agency fee payers by the union and --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. You agree that the union could segregate these funds as opposed to commingling them, and that would cure, that would in effect answer your, your constitutional objection?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it wouldn't, because then the question is what do you do after you've segregated them. If the statute --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's clear from the statute that, that what you would do would be leave them subject to the opt-in determination, but all other funds, i.e., the funds that you are constitutionally entitled to protect, would be unencumbered.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Certainly Justice Souter, but then the question is, for those fee payers, and certainly there are going to be some out of three or four thousand that do not give affirmative authorization, then what do you do with their funds? And the, the --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you think that would create an independent constitutional problem assuming that you did segregate the funds?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, the --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That would, that would create an issue? You know, what if they say: Nothing? Maybe, maybe the statute does not deal adequately with that. But does that raise a constitutional problem that in effect would be, would be of equal parity with the one that is, that is raised on behalf of the, the, the dissenting workers?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, the reason it raises a constitutional problem is because of the content discrimination issue. What the State is saying is that you have a right to collect an agency fee that is the full equivalent of union dues, but if you choose to spend any money from your treasury for electoral advocacy, you may spend whatever you want from your treasury for -- for legislative lobbying, for public relations, for all kinds of other issues, forms of speech that are not chargeable to objectors. But if you choose to spend any for one particular type of speech, namely electoral advocacy, then you must segregate and refund a portion of the --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that's, under --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to the fee payers.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Under the Federal law you can't even have this opt-in system. You have to have a separate organization as I understand, for the election. So there would be no, no possibility that the nonmember of the union, that funds would go to election financing.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Certainly, Justice Ginsburg.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's much harder on the union, I would think, isn't it?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's much harder on the union in that respect but not in the respect that's critical here, and that is the Federal law as well as the laws of all the other States who have, have required separate segregated funds limit that requirement to candidate elections. The, the reason this statute is unconstitutional, the reason it does not consist of a compelling, does not provide a compelling governmental interest in regulating elections, is because it goes far beyond the permissible realm of regulating expenditures on candidate elections, and prohibits the union without affirmative authorization from spending its funds for ballot propositions.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're -- you're back to its funds again.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Whether they're --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you're saying, first you said well, segregating the funds does not answer the problem. And I thought the reason it didn't answer the problem was that the, that it was, that the purposes of the, of the act were underinclusive. And now you're responding to Justice Ginsburg by going back to making the assumption that the segregated funds would be the union's funds.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Souter, if they are segregated, if the union segregates them, assuming they don't -- for those for whom they don't receive affirmative authorization, they keep them in escrow indefinitely, or they put them in a locked box and never do anything with them, certainly the union would satisfy the statute in -- in that way. But what, what the statute says as interpreted by the trial court, if then the union puts those funds back into its general treasury, or even if it doesn't, and spends them in some way for some purpose whatever, that it's violating the statute. And the only way that the union can comply is by not only segregating the funds, but then if affirmative authorization is not received, by rebating a certain portion of the fund to the individual fee payers.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I thought that approach was exactly what we held was required in the Street decision, the International Association of Machinists versus Street, so that you can't get around this requirement by saying, oh well, we'll use the objectors' funds for collective bargaining and we'll use the others for that.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. Exactly. And that's -- and that's why I think that that interpretation of the statute may be correct. But the problem we have here is this is a statute, and why it's unconstitutional is this is a statute that is saying this only with respect to a particular kind of speech. It's saying the union may collect a hundred percent of dues and it may spend them in whatever way it deems appropriate for --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Doesn't that objection apply whether it's opt in or opt out?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it doesn't, Mr. Chief Justice, because the -- the -- in -- in the Street and Abood decisions, the Court has -- has said that there is -- all -- has talked in terms of expenditures that are not germane to collective bargaining.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it content discrimination which subjects legislation to strict scrutiny if the Government, Federal Government or a State designates certain funds for use by school districts to teach patriotism, American history, something like that? Is that subject to strict scrutiny?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, because this is Government funding. This is --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. Now let's assume it's not Government funding. Instead of doing that the Government says, you will have authority to collect money from certain people only for a particular purpose. Is that content discrimination which calls into play strict scrutiny?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I believe it is, Justice Scalia, because --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't see why the one is any worse than the other. The Government has a particular purpose in mind and in one case it gives out money with that purpose in mind, which discriminates of course; in the other case it allows this extraordinary power to exact funds from people, but only for certain purposes. That's not the kind of content discrimination that they calls strict scrutiny into play, it seems to me.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's strict scrutiny if it's not the Government acting as the speaker, and the Government is acting here as --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Here is the Government acting as a coercer. It's because of the Government that you're allowed to get this money from these non-union members.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't believe the Court has ever put it quite that way in the Government speech cases, the Government funding cases.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask this question on your overinclusive, or underinclusive rather, argument? Supposing the statute was broader and said the union may not use any non-member agency fee collections for any non-germane purpose at all without affirmative consent? Would that solve all the constitutional problems?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the problem here -- let me say two things in response to that, Justice Stevens.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could you just tell me yes or no, and then explain?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Certainly. Well, the answer is yes and no. The answer is, if you're talking about -- (Laughter.)
05-1589 +++$+++ 38184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ At least insofar as your argument under inclusiveness, the answer would have to be that was, that statute would be okay.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if the -- if you're -- if what you're doing is talking about the, an election statute like --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm talking about a statute that the individuals say I don't want to spend any more money, give any more money to the union than I absolutely have to. And the legislature decides to protect the right, that right by saying you cannot use agency sock fees for any non-germane purpose. What's wrong with that?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That, Justice Stevens, if this is what the state is saying with respect to the public sector employees as to which it has the authority to regulate the agency fee. This is perfectly constitutional. This is the kind of --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If that's perfectly constitutional, this is a fortiori okay.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it's less of a burden on the union and there's less protection to the employee.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it's not. It's a different case for two reasons, Justice Stevens. First of all, because it's content discriminatory. It's not saying the -- it's not saying you -- we limit the agency fee to the nonchargeable, the non-germane, or to the purposes that are germane to collective bargaining. The State can permissibly do that because it's making --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why isn't that a content-based restriction? You've got to look at it and see if it's germane.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The purposes that -- the purposes for which the -- that are being excluded in that case are a wide variety of different kinds of speech and non-speech activities, not only political speech but public relations. Many courts have interpreted organizing activities to be non-germane to collective bargaining. Membership benefits that are not available, non-members are put in that category. Donations to charities. International activities. There's a whole variety of union expenditures that the courts have held are not germane to collective bargaining and cannot be charged over a non-member's objection, and a State would be perfectly free, as several states like Pennsylvania and New Mexico have, to say our judgment is that our interest in labor peace does not extend further than in authorizing an agency fee that includes purposes germane to collective bargaining.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm just curious below in the opinion, I didn't notice in footnote 6, which I hadn't taken in, that the court explicitly says that you did not make any argument about underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness with respect to other organizations, corporations and so forth. Now, did -- I can't recall, I just don't recall. What you're saying now, I take it, is that the word "election," you can't use it for elections, and elections involve candidates and they also involve ballot issues.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Correct.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And you're saying that the real problem with this statute is that it throws in ballot issues along with candidate elections.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there are two problems. There's the concept -- I mean, there's --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But on that first one, did they discuss that at some length in the lower court opinion? I don't --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The lower court, no, did not discuss the --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So this is really a ground that they haven't considered.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What the Washington Supreme Court held is that the -- what was argued in the Washington Supreme Court generally is that this is a violation of the union's right to engage in political advocacy.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But this thing about the ballot issue is not there.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the reason -- this is a reason I think the Washington Supreme Court took note of the fact of what the funds were spent on, on balloting initiatives solely, not on candidate elections.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In fact, you want to us decide that question, and was there another one that -- you just said there were two reasons basically.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the two reasons why the statute fails to constitute a compelling Government interest are the overbroad extension to ballot propositions, unlike the Federal law and any other State law. And secondly, the underinclusiveness that this is a statute that is ostensibly intended to protect the integrity of the elections by ensuring that the funds that organizations spend for political electoral purposes represent the views of the people from whom those funds were derived. And the -- what the State has chosen to regulate to advance that interest is solely people who already have the opportunity to prevent the use of their funds for purposes they disagree with, while not regulating at all other entities in which --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's the argument that the State Supreme Court in footnote 6 expressly said you did not raise.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that would be a valid argument if we were attempting to raise an equal protection claim here, Mr. Chief Justice. That's not what we're doing. What we're saying, we are making an argument based on what the State Supreme Court held, namely that this is a violation of the -- the union's right to engage in political speech, and this is one of the reasons for it. Granted, that particular justification for the ruling was not argued below, but this is not like we were attempting to argue equal protection, a totally new basis.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ On which -- on what you were arguing, you were very careful in your brief to say funds lawfully possessed by the union, as distinguished from what's in a corporate treasury or -- there is something peculiar about this, and you recognized it by saying we possess them, because if the non-member wants it back, the non-member would be entitled. So it's not like money in the corporate till.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it is, Justice Ginsburg, if the -- this is why the purpose of the statute is so important. If the purpose of the statute is to protect the integrity of the elections by ensuring that what organizations spend for political purposes represents the views of those who contributed the money, then it's very much to the point that there are other organizations. For example, the Michigan Chamber of Commerce --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You want us to consider this case as if the First Amendment rights of non-union members were not involved?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely -- absolutely not, Justice Kennedy. We recognize --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that's been your whole argument so far.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely not. I'm sorry, Justice Kennedy, but that's certainly not what I intend to be saying. We recognize that the non-members have First Amendment rights. We also recognize that those rights are protected by the Hudson procedures which the union uses. The non-members have the absolute right to prevent the use of their funds not only for this kind of electoral speech but for any kind of political ideological speech and other nonchargeable activities with which they disagree simply by sending in a letter.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So it's a First Amendment right that is waived by failing to make a timely objection.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's not that a right is waived. What it is --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's gone under your theory.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. It's -- Justice Stevens, it's what the right is. The constitutional right is a right against being required to -- to engage in compelled speech.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Which no longer exists if you don't make a timely objection.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, you have the -- but that would be just like -- like the solicitor general on the -- the license plate case. Someone who receives in the mail the license plate that says "Live Free or Die" or "Taxation Without Representation" and puts it on his car is not waiving a constitutional right by --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not exactly the same situation. These are teachers who have chosen not to join the Washington Education Association; isn't that right?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ These are teachers who have not joined the Washington Education --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't it overwhelmingly likely that they, if you spoke to them and you said would you like to give money to the union to spend on elections, they would say no?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I absolutely disagree with you, Justice Alito, because keep in mind --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Explain to me the thinking of somebody who chooses not to join, the 5 percent who choose not to join, and yet they would like to make this contribution. Now maybe there's some, but what would be the thinking of such a person?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not asking them to make a contribution. It's asking them, is it okay with you if your money is used for this purpose. But keep in mind what the money is being used for here.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's the difference between that?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The money is being used --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's the difference between saying would you like to make a contribution, and would you like to allow us to use money that we possess for our purposes rather than returning it to us? What's the difference between those two?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, whether there is a difference or not, Justice Alito, the point is the union here is using this money for purposes that it has every reason to believe is in the interest of the vast majority of teachers, including --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well surely, they get to make that decision, don't they? Under the statute, it's their decision whether or not -- you don't get to say, well, this is in your interests, or whether you'd want to spend the money or not.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but I'm responding to the suggestion that there should be some kind of presumption that they would, would decline to authorize this. That's -- the question you raised, Mr. Chief Justice, is exactly the question before the Court, whether the State can, constitutionally can insist that the union obtain affirmative authorization for this particular type of speech and for no other type of speech. Let me -- let me suggest --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I still don't understand the thinking of these hypothetical people. If I'm a union member, I get various benefits. If I choose not to be a union member, I don't get those benefits. Why would I choose to give up the benefits of union membership and yet want to allow the union to spend my money for its political purposes?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, maybe Mr. -- Justice Alito, if you knew that what the union was spending its money for was to improve, to increase cost of living adjustments for teachers or to reduce class size for teachers, or to enact tax levies in local school districts --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is this all hypothetical, Mr. West, or is there any empirical evidence about what the people who are non-union members, if they had their druthers, would they say not a penny more goes into the union till than we are forced to put there? Is there any empirical evidence that divides up the universe of people who don't, deliberately don't join unions?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. Justice Ginsburg, there's a lot of speculation on both sides. I don't think there's any empirical evidence, but there is plenty of reason to think that there are many reasons that people choose not to join the union, whether from a free rider motivation, whether from just not being a joiner, any variety of reasons. Some of them may be --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you're free under this system to send them the same sort of materials you send about your PAC and say we do all sorts of good things with the money from people who opt in, you should opt in.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But you want to do it without giving them that opportunity.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the question is whether the State can compel us to, to obtain that authorization for this limited type of speech.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Only if the State has given you the power to exact the money from these people. That changes everything. If this was money that they had contributed themselves, you'd have a different argument, but the State compels them to give you that money and the State says however, you will not use this money for this purpose without their consent.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It doesn't change everything, Justice Scalia, precisely for the reasons that you discussed in your opinion for the court in RAV versus St. Paul, the St. Paul cross-burning case, where you pointed out that, that the greater includes the lesser argument does not apply where you have content discrimination. The State could justifiably ban all symbols and displays that involve fighting words, but it could not single out a particular --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That brings us back to the question I asked earlier and I suggested in my answer to that I don't think it's content discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government gives money for a particular purpose only and not for other purposes, and I also don't think it's content discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government allows a private organization to use governmental power to exact money from people for a particular purpose only. That's a different ball game.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Scalia, imagine, if I may take a little bit starker example, imagine that what the government said in the statute that the union must obtain affirmative authorization if it is going to use agency fee funds to support Democratic candidates, but not if it's going to support Republican candidates. Obviously it couldn't do that.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I see that you've put a lot of weight on this argument.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that -- it goes further than this. That's viewpoint discrimination. But this is content discrimination and the Court has held in Consolidated Edison and a number of other cases that that is also a constitutional problem.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What you're saying right now, if it is, is ballots versus candidates under the word "election."
05-1589 +++$+++ 38247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Exactly.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that has a lot of implications for all kinds of campaign finance law that has nothing to do, I think, with unions.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Exactly.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the lower court didn't consider it, and is this open now, if it's going back for other things such as the State Constitution, for them to consider this matter on remand?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it would be open to them to consider. I also think it's a matter that when we get to that point at least --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I don't know, perhaps you don't know, what the implication of a decision say in your favor here would have for Vermont's campaign finance law or California's or some other.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Perhaps, but it's certainly true that on this, at least on this point of the lack of any compelling justification for restricting entities' contributions and expenditures in support of or in opposition to ballot propositions, the law, this Court's law, is fully clearly on that point. It's our submission, Mr. Chief Justice, that what you have here is a content-based restriction on WEA's ability to engage in political speech on issues of educational policy that are of vital importance to the 70,000 teachers that it represents.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could the State have a restriction requiring affirmative authorization for all union expenditures that fall within the Abood-Machinist line of cases?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. If this were -- particularly if this were --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If this were across the board as to all First Amendment rights an objecting member has, then the statute would be void -- would be valid, rather?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Certainly if this were done in the statute that authorized the agency fee in the first place.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it's done in this statute.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If it's done in this statute, the problem that would remain, Justice Kennedy, is this is an election law that presumably has to be justified on the basis of whether it promotes the integrity of elections. And when you have --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, my hypothetical is that there's a Washington statute or a Washington constitutional referendum provision, initiative provision, which says that as to all protected speech for non- union members who have moneys taken out, there must be affirmative authorization.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The State could do that, at least if it limited it to the public sector, where the State has the authority to authorize the amount of the agency fee. I believe the State could do that. The State could certainly -- some people have talked about the size of the Hudson notice. The State could impose requirements that the notice be clearer, that it be shorter. The state could impose that affirmative authorization requirement. The State could limit the --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38262 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Back to your example about the political party saying you can't use it for Democrats, what if they said, as they might have in the 1940s, you can use it for anybody except communist candidates?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38263 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think that would be a problem, too. And that's --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. WEST +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That would be viewpoint discriminatory, but here we have a legislative statute that, that it's content discriminatory, that can't be justified as a compelling State interest to promote the integrity of the elections, and we believe the judgment of the Washington Supreme Court should be affirmed. Thank you.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. West. General McKenna, you have 7 minutes remaining.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38268 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, thank you. First of all, I wanted to get back to a question raised by Justice Breyer concerning whether they get their money back. I took your question to refer to a hypothetical, but allow me to address the real circumstances in this case by referring to the joint appendix at 210-212. These are the pages covering the permanent injunction that was entered by the trial court. Under that permanent injunction, the WEA shall return to all agency fee payers who have not affirmatively authorized the use of their fees for expenditures, and it lays out the means of doing that. For the first 2 years there's an agreed-upon amount. For the next 3 years of the injunction there's another amount. But they do get their money back under that injunction. Referring to the issue of whether they waive or not, under the current process used by the WEA, referring to JA-198, which is the letter sent out on September 15, 2000, by the WEA to the non-members, you'll note the statement, quote: "If such written objection has not been postmarked by October 16, 2000, you will waive your ability to object." The State of Washington's position is that non-members should not be required to say no twice. They said no when they chose not to join the union. The union's position now is, well, we get to use your money for political purposes unless you say no a second time. That does not seem to be a reasonable default position to take and certainly we believe the State --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the State of Washington seems to think that's fine for everything other than election expenses.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, in terms of Section 760 the State of Washington does think that's fine because of the purpose of the statute and the purpose of Section 760, the purpose being to protect the integrity of the elections by several different means involving protecting --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, do you see an underlying constitutional problem as to non-election expenditures that are still political expenditures?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't take a position on whether there's a constitutional problem with regard to non- germane expenditures, Your Honor. But we do believe --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Didn't we take one in Abood?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Didn't we take a position in Abood?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What I meant was --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I suppose the way the statute works, you have to opt in for the election expenditures, but you have to have a right to opt out for other non-germane.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Your Honor, the Chief Justice is correct, of course. What I thought the question was about was the question of whether or not all, all non-germane expenses must be opt-in, must be provided. That's all I meant. You're absolutely correct. Of course, in your decisions opt-out is satisfactory, and we're not saying that opt-out is not satisfactory here as far as the State's position is concerned. But what we are saying is that the State has the right to impose this additional requirement of affirmative authorization.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What do you say about his hypothetical involving Democrats versus Republicans?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, that would certainly seem to be viewpoint discrimination, and it would implicate --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, he says, well, this is content discrimination. Is that --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, we do not agree that this is content, content discrimination. This is content neutral. 760 establishes a procedure, that is to say a requirement that must be met before the money may be used.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but it's content in the sense that only some speech has to be affirmatively authorized.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, that additional affirmative authorization does apply to this category of speech, influencing an election or operating a political committee. But we don't believe that it is problematic constitutionally any more than the argument of Taxpayers With Representations in the Reagan case was, where they argued that they had a constitutional right to receive tax deductible contributions and use them for lobbying. The Court found to the contrary. And indeed, Initiative 134 is about protecting individuals. It's about protecting individuals in Section 760. It says in the intent section --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can I just go back to, you mentioned my question.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, sir.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your point of your answer to his hypothetical is, well, the viewpoint discrimination would be impermissible, but the content discrimination is permissible?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If it is content discrimination, Your Honor, we believe it is permissible, yes, sir. And if it were viewpoint -- in the hypothetical, if there were viewpoint discrimination that would not implicate any constitutional right of the union, but it may very well implicate the Southworth interests of the non-member fee payers.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it content? I mean, it doesn't say which way you're trying to influence the election.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We don't believe it is content-based, Your Honor. As I said, we don't believe it is, because it's any election of any kind.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the content means a category of speech as opposed to what is the political position you're taking.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, that is it's only in regard to influencing elections or operating a political committee, which is a second.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I thought that that was content. You could do it, say, in the press, but you couldn't do it over the air.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's my understanding, too. I think you got to get out of it some other way. I mean, you've got to say it's content but it doesn't apply when it's the government contributing money or it doesn't apply when you're applying it to money that's being coerced by the government.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If that's yes, then the category here is election speech. If you're going to call a statute that treats election speech especially, then all of campaign finance regulation would fall in that category. And if you're going to use that distinction to say strict scrutiny applies, then strict scrutiny would apply to all campaign finance regulation. And courts never to my knowledge apply strict scrutiny to campaign finance regulation because there are speech interests on both sides of the equation.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. Of course, we believe that --
05-1589 +++$+++ 38298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm glad you said yes to me because that implies a no to the last question. (Laughter.)
05-1589 +++$+++ 38299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, I understand your question. (Laughter.)
05-1589 +++$+++ 38300 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And we believe that -- we believe of course that Section 760 is not subject to strict scrutiny, it is subject at most to a rationale basis; and that clearly there is a rationale basis for the State in this case to require the affirmative authorization of non-member fee payers.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38301 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can you get to the point you were about to make, what the purpose of the thing is?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, yes, Your Honor. Your Honor, the Supreme Court of Washington found a purpose of the entire law, Initiative 134, to be to protect election integrity. But 760 is one means of achieving that purpose by means of protecting individual interests. Similarly, Section 680 of this law, which, I apologize, is not in the joint appendix, but it's RCW 4217-680, which requires positive checkoff before an employer may deduct PAC contributions for any employee.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I just -- I'm sorry. May I just take you back to the point of the objective being protection of election integrity. As I understand it, so far as the protection of election integrity is concerned, with respect to these contributions, that is simply the obverse side or the flip side, if you will, of protecting the right of the dissenting union member or the non-joined -- strike that -- the non-union worker, to control the use of the funds that would be used for the political purposes. The one is simply the obverse of the other. Do you agree?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. We believe they are two sides of the same coin.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So by articulating that the election integrity is a purpose, the Washington Supreme Court should not be understood as excluding the protection of the non-member workers' interests?
05-1589 +++$+++ 38306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MCKENNA +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. I would agree. Thank you.
05-1589 +++$+++ 38307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, General. The case is submitted.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38311 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument first today in case 05-1629 Gonzales versus Duenas-Alvarez. Mr. Himelfarb.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38313 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. The Ninth Circuit held that the term theft offense, an aggravated felony under the Immigration and Nationality Act, does not include aiding and abetting. That holding is incorrect. Indeed, it is so clearly incorrect that even respondent does not defend it. Respondent's aiding and abetting argument is that his violation of the California vehicle theft statute is not a theft offense under the INA, not because the California statute covers aiding and abetting and the theft offense does not, as the Ninth Circuit held, but because the California statute covers a certain kind of aiding and abetting, so-called natural and probable consequences rule, and a theft offense does not. That theory is slightly narrower than the Ninth Circuit's but it is mistaken for many of the same reasons. One of the reasons that the Ninth Circuit's holding is mistaken is that it would drastically limit the number of aliens who could be treated as aggravated felons based on a conviction obtained in any jurisdiction, because no jurisdiction distinguishes between principals and aiders and abetters and it is ordinarily not possible to prove that an alien in a particular case was not convicted as an aider and abettor. Respondent's theory would have the same effect when a conviction was obtained in any jurisdiction that obtains the natural and probable consequences rule.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Will you help me out on one mechanical point? As you probably know from your brief, I don't come from a jurisdiction that uses this rule and I'm just not used to it. I had thought -- and I guess I'm wrong -- that if the natural and probable consequences theory were used to prove, let's say, ultimately the offense of assault, in what started out as a theft case, that there would have to be a separate charge of assault but that the theory of proof would be the natural and consequences extension of aiding and abetting so that there would at least be on the record a charge of assault. And I take it that's not the case.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I don't think it is. I --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Otherwise, you wouldn't have this problem.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it is the case that the aider and abettor has to intend to aid and abet what is sometimes called the target crime. It also has to be the case that the principal has to then go on to commit some other crime, a subsequent crime. The issue then arises whether the aider and abettor who intended to assist the target crime is held liable for the subsequent crime.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But in any case in my example of -- of theft, and the further offense under natural and probable consequences being assault, the only charge against the defendant who aided and abetted would be a charge of theft; is that correct?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It could be. It could be. But in the course of proving the aider and abettor guilty of the subsequent crime on this natural and probable consequences theory, there would have to be proof that bore upon the target crime to show what his intent was with respect to the target crime and also whether the subsequent crime was a foreseeable consequence of the initial crime.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't understand it. How can he be convicted of -- of the consequential crime if he is never charged with the consequential crime? You charge him with the -- with the theft and convict him of assault?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Scalia. He would have to be charged with the subsequent crime.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, well I thought you -- I thought you answered --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Me too.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I didn't mean to say that. I meant to say he didn't have to be charged with the initial crime. In fact, even the principal wouldn't have to be charged with the initial crime or for that matter, any crime. The aider and abettor could be charged only with a consequent crime but in the course of proving that under the natural and probable consequences rule, there would have to be proof with respect to the target crime, because the elements of the natural and probable consequences rule depend upon what happened.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The theory being that anybody who intended to aid and abet a crime which naturally leads to another crime intended the other crime as well.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the basic principle.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Himmelfarb, does the government urge that we consider the point that you're now arguing and the other points? You started out by saying everyone agrees that the rationale of the Ninth Circuit won't wash, but if we go beyond that, then we are deciding the question as a matter of first view instead of review. Does the government urge that we dispose of those issues anyway, even though they were not disposed of by the Ninth Circuit?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We think that the aiding and betting argument that respondent raises is fairly included within the question presented and that it should be resolved. We don't think the other two issues are fairly included within the question presented. We think that this issue is fairly presented within the -- fairly included within the question presented and should resolve --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it wasn't discussed by the Ninth Circuit, was it?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It wasn't, Justice Ginsburg, but it bears upon the question of what it means to say that an aggravated felony encompasses aiding and abetting. If the Court simply holds contrary to the Ninth Circuit's holding that aiding and abetting is included in an aggravated felony, it will leave open a very important question which we think the Court should provide guidance to the lower courts on. It would leave open the question of whether that means that there is some general Federal immigration law definition of aiding and abetting with which the law of aiding and abetting in the jurisdiction of conviction would have to be compared in every single removal case, at least potentially, or rather as we would submit, that Congress intended to cover the entire range of aiding and abetting under whatever formulation was used in any jurisdiction at the time the aiding and abetting provision was added to the Immigration and Nationality Act.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And what about the remaining questions that were not decided by the Ninth Circuit?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, certainly the --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do we remand for those or what?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. It's open to -- it would be open to the Ninth Circuit. Assuming the Ninth Circuit were of the view that they were fairly raised in the Ninth Circuit, and also that they were fairly raised in the agency, it would be open to the Ninth Circuit to resolve those questions in the first instance. Let me just add that --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why would it have to be raised in the Ninth Circuit? I thought this case was controlled by a prior decision of the Ninth Circuit. Therefore, there was nothing more that was needed to take care of this case.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true. The Ninth Circuit didn't pass upon any issue except the question whether aiding and abetting as a general matter is included in a theft offense. Relying on a prior decision, it held that it wasn't, and sent the case back to the Board of Immigration Appeals. But there, I think it would still be fair for the government to argue that a particular theory that may be raised here in defense of the judgment wasn't properly raised either in the Ninth Circuit by respondent, or before the agency, such that that claim was not properly exhausted.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38337 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Himelfarb, you point out these last two issues are not, and probably correctly, that they are not fairly included within the question presented. Well, that would be disabling if indeed it was the petitioner that is seeking to raise those two additional issues. But here it is the respondent; and we can certainly reach those issues if we want to.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38338 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course. Of course.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The respondent can seek to uphold the judgment below on whatever grounds he wishes.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Of course.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So we can reach those other issues if we wish.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38342 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's ultimately a matter of the Court's discretion. Our submission is that the wiser exercise of the Court's discretion would not -- would be not to address the issue, particularly the last issue raised in respondent's brief.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38343 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the only thing that the Ninth Circuit held was that the definition of a theft offense in California is broader than the generic definition of theft. All of these arguments that are being discussed are ways in which that particular ruling is supported. I don't know why they wouldn't be considered subsumed under the Ninth Circuit's decision.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38344 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we don't read the Ninth Circuit's order that way. We think the Ninth Circuit simply reversed on the strength of its prior decision in Penuliar. And in Penuliar, the Ninth Circuit clearly held the reason this California statute was not a theft offense was that conviction under it is possible under an aiding and betting liability theory. So insofar as the order relied on Penuliar, it was saying nothing more and nothing less than that respondent's conviction was not a theft offense because it is theoretically possible he was convicted as an aider and abettor and the definition of theft offense under the INA does not include aiding and abetting. Now as I was saying, I think it's important for the Court to make clear what it means to say, that aiding and abetting is included in the aggravated felony definition. And this -- the type of argument that respondent raises here, I think is important to keep in mind, is not limited to the particular aspect of aiding and abetting law on which he relies. There are a great many different formulations of the basic requirements of aiding and betting. Not only that they -- they vary not only from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but even within jurisdictions. So in the next case, you could imagine an alien or removal case arguing that because some other requirement of aiding and abetting law in the jurisdiction in which he was convicted is broader than the more typical formulation, that even though he was clearly convicted of, for example, murder, and even though the elements of murder in that jurisdiction perfectly match up with the federal definition of murder in the immigration statute --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38345 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Counsel, you're ahead of me, and I'm still back on the last question, but I take it your rationale for not reaching these other grounds would also apply to your argument that whatever the categorical definition, that this defendant was convicted of an actual theft offense, looking at the charging documents. That wasn't a basis for the Ninth Circuit's decision either.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true, Mr. Chief Justice. Our main submission is that the Ninth Circuit relied on an issue of aiding and abetting. We petitioned on that question and the Court granted certiorari on that question. The three grounds on which respondent relies on defense of the judgment, even though they all vary in some sense from the Ninth Circuit's ground, two of them simply have nothing to do with aiding and abetting. The first ground is an aiding and abetting argument. It's slightly different from the one, slightly narrower than the one on which the Ninth Circuit relied, but we think it's fairly included and we think the Court should address it. We think the Court should reject it for the reasons I am attempting to articulate now. If you have a jurisdiction with a law of aiding and abetting that is broader, it can be characterized as broader in some sense than what might be thought to be the general notion of aiding and abetting, under the premise of respondent's theory, you could conceivably have this kind of argument in any removal case --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What if a particular jurisdiction has an entirely novel and fundamentally different theory of aiding and abetting? Is it simply sufficient that it is labeled aiding and abetting?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Alito, we think it would be perfectly appropriate for the Court to leave open the question that if at some point in the future, some entirely novel radical far-reaching theory of aiding and abetting were adopted, that would not be sufficient. I don't think as the law currently stands there is any such theory in any jurisdiction; and I think that Congress should be presumed when it enacted the aggravated felony provision, to be covering the field of possibilities. But if at some point in the future some jurisdiction decided that, you know, somebody could be strictly liable --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Himmelfarb, what about accessory after the fact, do your comments apply to that argument as well?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we think that that's not fairly included within the question presented. We think that's just a -- accessory after the fact is a separate crime
05-1629 +++$+++ 38351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it may not be fairly included but as you've acknowledged, it is an argument asserted to defend the judgment.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right. We think that the Court could resolve that issue along the lines we've suggested in our reply brief. Respondent's basic submission on that point is that the term -- the phrase in the California statute, any person who is a party or an accessory to or an accomplice in the driving or unauthorized taking or stealing, that in that phrase the term accessory means accessory after the fact. An accessory after the fact is not included in the definition of the theft offense. Therefore, the California statute is broader than a theft offense. It's our submission that the Court can assume that he's right about that but still rule for the government on the accessory after the fact issue, because whatever the statute might say, he was charged as a principal. And the law is clear that somebody charged as a principal --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do we know that? I was looking at, what is it, 13-A? How do we know that that charge is as a principal? In the appendix to the petition.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, it tracks the language of the statute up to the point where the statute uses the phrase I just read. So it's principal language. It's theoretically possible that he was convicted as an aider and abettor because the law in California, as it is elsewhere, is that somebody charged as a principal can be convicted as an aider and abettor; but the law in California, as it is elsewhere, is that somebody charged as a principal cannot be convicted as an accessory after the fact. There is no language in the charging instrument to suggest that respondent was charged as an accessory after the fact.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But to accept your answer, we've got to look into a question of California pleading law which hasn't been passed on below.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's right. Respondent raises a number of arguments in response essentially to the argument I just made. We think they're all entirely insubstantial and could be rejected quite easily. But it may well be that the Court would think that the better course is not to address the accessory after the fact issue.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why wouldn't the better course be also not to decide the principal question you want us to decide on the broad ground that you want us to take, which is that if there are minor differences between what you might call the general law of aiding and abetting, it doesn't matter. Why wouldn't it be wiser to decide this on the simple ground that this kind of consequential liability is part of the general law of aiding and abetting, which you argue in your brief? So that would be the narrower ground.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That would be narrower ground. That is certainly our fallback position and we would not be at all unhappy if the case were resolved on that ground.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Even though that position has been widely criticized, I think. Is it the ALI Model Penal Code, which thinks it's a bad rule?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There has been some criticism of the rule, Justice Ginsburg, but it is applied in criminal cases in Federal courts; and whatever criticism there might be in the academic literature, even in some state decisions, we think it is just inconceivable that Congress would have intended that somebody could be convicted under this theory under the Federal criminal law and be subject to the same criminal penalties as a principal, and yet under the federal immigration law could not be subject to the same immigration consequences as a principal. So whatever grounds there are for criticizing it, it is the law in most places. And most importantly, we think, it is the law in Federal courts. Taking account of minor variations in formulation of aiding and abetting standards among jurisdictions would not only have the consequence of drastically limiting the number of aliens who could be found to be aggravated felons, because of the difficulty of establishing that someone was convicted as a principal rather than an aider and abettor. It would also complicate removal cases enormously, as I mentioned. The premise of respondent's aiding and abetting theory would suggest that in any case, it would be necessary for the immigration judge, board of immigration appeals and the reviewing court, to engage not only in an analysis of whether the principal offense of conviction matches some Federal definition, which itself can be a quite complex enterprise, but having done that, it would then have to go on and compare the aiding and abetting law of the state of conviction with some Federal aiding and abetting law.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In that former question as to whether California theft is general theft, do you propose the same rule? That even if California has some minor variations -- not just in aiding and abetting but in what constitutes theft -- minor variations from what the general national rule is, they should be disregarded? And if not, why not?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we think that -- we don't, first of all. And I think no court would say that and we certainly wouldn't. But there's a very important difference insofar as that type of comparison was concerned between on the one hand a principal offense and on the other hand aiding and abetting. The two important differences are if you have a general definition of the principal offense, whether it's a theft offense or burglary, any reasonable framework would contemplate that in a great many cases you would be able to tell whether the alien before the court was convicted of that offense, of the Federal definition of that offense, simply by looking at the State statute of conviction; and if it matches it, that's the end of the analysis. If it's broader, in most cases you'd be able to look at the charging instrument and see whether that person was charged with something narrower than the whole range of conduct that's covered by the statute. Under respondent's theory, if you were to apply that same approach to aiding and abetting you would never be able to look at the statute to see whether somebody was convicted under an aiding and abetting theory that matches the Federal definition because every statute includes aiding and abetting, so it's impossible to tell from the statute whether somebody was convicted as a principal or an aider and abettor. Then if you look at the charging instrument, that won't suffice either because the law everywhere as far as I'm aware is that somebody charged as a principal can be convicted as an aider and abettor. So the only cases in which you'd be able to establish that somebody was not convicted as an aider and abettor are the unusual cases where there happens to be something in the files of the criminal case that will explain in some admissible fashion whether the defendant was convicted as a principal or an aider and abettor. That's the first important distinction. The second --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you would limit your rule just to aiding and abetting and not to other minor variations, just minor variations in the aiding and abetting definition?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right. I mean, our submission is that Congress's intent in enacting an aggravated felony provision that captures aiders and abettors was that minor variations in formulation wouldn't matter for the reasons I'm giving. So it's ultimately a matter of Congressional intent. The second reason why this is important is because if you were to apply that rule to aiding and abetting you would be saying, in effect, that in any jurisdiction that applies a broader rule of aiding and abetting every single crime in the criminal code would not qualify for aggravated felony status, because an aiding and betting statute runs with the entirety of the criminal code and is a potential theory of liability for every substantive criminal offense. So that would mean that in those, those broader aiding and abetting jurisdictions, nothing could ever be an aggravated felony unless the government could somehow search through the criminal files and find something to prove that in fact the defendant was not convicted under an aiding and abetting theory.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Himmelfarb, before your time runs out, there's something curious about this California statute. This one is in the Motor Vehicle Code, and there's this offense in the Penal Code called car theft. Do you know what the difference between those two and what would move a prosecutor to charge under the Penal Code as opposed to the Vehicle Code?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the theft offense that covers cars under than this one in California that I'm aware of, Justice Ginsburg, is just a grand theft statute, which is just general theft as applied to particular circumstances, one of which is the theft of a car.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's mentioned in what, 487(d)?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right. That's right. And as I understand it, that is essentially a larceny statute, which encompasses a common law larceny rule, which is that there has to be an intent to steal or, stated differently, that there has to be an intent to deprive the owner of the car, of the car permanently, whereas the California vehicle theft statute at issue here is a broader statute in that it doesn't require any intent to steal. It doesn't even require a taking. A driving is sufficient. So it would capture the receipt of stolen property. And it doesn't require an intent to deprive the owner of the car permanently. It would be sufficient if there was an intent to deprive the owner of the car temporarily.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It covers joyriding?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it would cover -- it would cover what is colloquially known as joyriding if it fell within the terms of the statute. That is, if there was an intent to deprive the owner of the property. And on the subject of joyriding, let me --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Temporarily.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ At least temporarily. Respondent makes much of the fact that on our reading of the statute, on our understanding, that a theft offense would cover the California vehicle theft statute here. That would mean that joyriding would be included. But I think it's critical to keep in mind that there are two very important limitations in the Federal definition of theft offense. The first is that, as interpreted by the Board of Immigration Appeals, it does require an intent to deprive the owner of property, and a great many unauthorized use of vehicle statutes in the State don't have that element. That's one important limitation. The other is that many of these statutes are misdemeanor statutes, so somebody convicted of it would not be sentenced to more than a year in prison. By the terms of the theft offense provision of the aggravated felony provision in the INA you have to be sentenced to at least a year in prison in order to be treated as an aggravated felon. So we think the vast majority of what is colloquially known as joyriding cases would not fall within this particular aggravated felony.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But in California they would? Or is there a separate joyriding --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38374 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. Joyriding in California would be prosecuted under this statute. But unless there was an intent to deprive, there could be no conviction, and unless the sentence was at least a year it would not be treated as an aggravated felony.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38375 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it the sentence given or the sentence prescribed for the crime?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38376 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The sentence given, Justice Scalia.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Given.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb. Mr. Meade.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38381 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I would like to pick up on the point made by Justice Ginsburg. This case does not involve a conviction under California's car theft statute, which is Penal Code 487(d), which requires an intent to steal. Rather, it involves a conviction under California's Vehicle Code, which covers varied and less serious conduct including liability with or without the intent to steal and also expressly reaching accessories after the fact, which the Government concedes would make it broader than the generic definition of theft. The question is whether a conviction under this statute is a theft offense and therefore an aggravated felony triggering the extremely serious consequences of automatic deportation from the United States, a permanent bar from the United States, and in the sentencing context a sentencing enhancement from 2 to 20 years for illegal reentry.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your friend began his argument by saying you don't defend the decision of the Ninth Circuit below on aiding and abetting. Is that correct?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We do defend the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I know the judgment, but you focused at least primarily on other grounds than the one on which the Ninth Circuit relied. Is he correct that you concede that merely because the statute extends to aiders and abettors that is not sufficient to take it out of the categorical treatment?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As an abstract general matter divorced from the facts of this case and divorced from California law, we agree that aiding and abetting liability is part of a generic definition of any crime, including the theft offense here. However, that's not what the Ninth Circuit stated in either this case or in Penuliar. In Penuliar the Ninth Circuit stressed the extremely broad nature of California's aiding and abetting liability. It cited a case, People v. Beeman, which refers to the specific natural and probable consequences doctrine under California law. So the Ninth Circuit was talking about the broad sweep of aiding and abetting liability under California law.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could I ask a factual question? I'm just curious. If the Government's statement of the facts here is correct, your client, a Peruvian, was convicted of burglary in 1992 and convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon in 1994, and nonetheless was made a lawful permanent resident in 1998. How does that happen? Is that a mistake or -- how do we decide who's admitted as a lawful permanent resident?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't know the answer to the question except to state that those two, those convictions did happen in the years that you state and he did become a lawful permanent resident in 1998. I believe it was through a waiver provision under the INA that that's how he became a lawful permanent resident.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He's not a joyrider anyway.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would disagree with that. All we know in this case from the record is that he was not charged with 487(d) car theft, which requires an intent to steal. He was rather charged under a conviction which covers joyriding. In my reading of the Government's brief, the Government doesn't contest that joyriding would put a statute outside the generic definition of theft offense. Even in the Government's presentation today, the Government suggested that in most States joyriding would be outside the generic definition of --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So then the Ninth Circuit was wrong in your opinion when it defined generic theft as the taking or exercising control over property without consent, with the intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits, even if it is less than permanent or total? They're wrong in your opinion?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I don't think they're wrong.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well then, I don't see how you make --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. I'd be happy to --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't that inconsistent with what you just said?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38395 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38396 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why not?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38397 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it's not inconsistent. We don't take the position that a permanent deprivation is required, is required. A less than permanent is sufficient, as the Ninth Circuit stated in Corona-Sanchez. The Ninth Circuit has subsequently held that a joyriding offense is outside that definition because it includes a brief taking with an intent to return, and the last footnote of the Government's brief, note 8, cites that Ninth Circuit case.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't understand how that could be right, though. I mean, when you joyride it's less than personal. In other words, their definition is if you take somebody else's property for an hour that that isn't theft, but if you take it for a day it is?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The question has to do with how long of the taking. And at common law --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They're trying to -- is there a common law, because they're trying to report -- is under the common law there a rule or any generic rule that says if you take somebody else's property for a couple of hours it is not theft, but if you take it for several hours or several days it is theft?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is a generic rule on this, and there is a consensus among the vast majority of States. I point to both Professor LeFave as well as the Model Penal Code. And what these rules say -- and this is true in the vast majority of States, 42 States by our count -- is that if you take either permanently or for an unreasonable amount of time such that it would deprive the owner of the significant portion of the economic value, then that constitute a theft offense.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You shouldn't steal it for an unreasonable amount of time, just for a reasonable amount of time?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Excuse me.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't understand the concept of stealing something for a reasonable amount of time.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I mean, that goes to the exact point, Justice Scalia, because we're not -- the question is what is stealing. The question --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're saying that the rule is something is theft only if you take it long enough to deprive an owner of a significant portion of its value?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Or a reasonable time, or to place --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no. Wait. I want to know where that comes from, because I would think I have a Volvo. It lasts for about 30 years, apparently. So I guess if you took my car for a year, that that then would not be a theft, or maybe it would be. Where is the source of the rule you just cited?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The source is the generic definition as applied in all of the States.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. I want a book. I want a book that will tell me that if they take my car for a month it isn't theft, but if they take it for a year it is. What book, or where do I look to verify that this is common law? I'm not denying what you're saying. I just want to know where to look.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. Two sources. One would be Professor LeFave in his discussion of what the intent required for the different theft offenses; and the second source would be the Model Penal Code when it sets forth the requisite mens rea for theft offenses.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That was the third reference to the Model Penal Code, so I have to ask. No one's enacted the Model Penal Code, have they?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. But in Taylor and in Seidler this Court used the Model Penal Code as a shorthand for the generic definition of a certain crime. But we don't rely on the Model Penal Code.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would you describe the Model Penal Code as closer to restatement or aspirational in terms of its reflection of the existence of general law?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would say that the Model Penal Code is consistent with the majority view. On this question of intent to steal, as we set forth in our brief, 42 States hold what we say the law is, that an intent to steal -- a theft offense requires a mens rea more than taking with an intent to give back.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You assert, you assert it's consistent with the majority view on this issue, not on everything. What does it say about the death penalty?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not sure what it says about the death penalty. On this issue.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that what joyriding is? That when you're done with your joy ride, you return the car where you picked it up? I thought they just abandoned it wherever you happen to be.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you abandon the car wherever you happen to be that's not joy riding. That's covered by traditional larceny principles. In the, the case of State v. Davis from 1875 involves that exact principle. That is larceny in that case. But however, if someone takes a car, a teenager, a neighbor takes a car, drives it around the block, brings it back to the same place, that is joyriding. That is covered by 108.51.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's the joy in that? (Laughter.)
05-1629 +++$+++ 38421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The joy apparently is you don't get convicted of theft. (Laughter.)
05-1629 +++$+++ 38422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what we have here is statute that criminalized conduct less serious than car theft. This is -- 108.51 is the only statute in California that covers joyriding. There's a whole different provision that deals with car theft. In cases where that's the appropriate charge, prosecutors will charge the person with car theft and meet the burden of proof. Here we're dealing with a less serious crime, a less serious statute and the question is whether this statute that require a very minimal mens rea, with or without intent to steal, is sufficient to lead to the very serious consequences of being an aggravated felony.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you understand that point to be what the Ninth Circuit relied on?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. Absolutely not. The Ninth Circuit didn't rely on that. It was presented to the Ninth Circuit but the Ninth Circuit did not rely on that.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So if we decided on the question, the aiding and abetting question, they did decide this would available to you to argue on remand?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Uh, yes.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because you presented it to the Ninth Circuit below.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, it would. I would like to also to address the question of accessory liability under California law. 108.51 expressly covers accessories. The Government concedes that if that term means accessory after the fact, then this statute is outside the generic definition of a theft offense. Under California law, accessory has only one meaning, and that one meaning is accessory after the fact. On that ground alone, this statute is broader than a generic definition of theft offense and would provide a -- an alternate ground of affirmance in this case.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Meade, the Government says that definition holds for penal code offenses, but it's not altogether clear that a definition in the penal code would carry over to the vehicle code.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38430 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I have two responses, Justice Ginsburg. First, there's a similar provision to 108.51 covering the taking or operating of an airplane. It is in the penal code. It is 499(b). It exactly mirrors the language of 108.51. So presumably the Government would agree that the definition of accessory under California law in the penal code would cover 499(b) for the same reasons it would cover under 108.51. Moreover, accessory under California law only has one meaning. In 1872 the California legislature passed the provision at issue, Section 32 and said accessory is defined to be accessory after the fact. At the same time, the legislature passed other provisions which also used accessory in that consistent way. The California Supreme Court as early as 1898 stated that accessory means accessory after the fact and relatedly, accessory before the fact, the only other plausible meaning of the term, has no meaning under California law. So with all due respect to the Government, accessory in 108.51 means accessory after the fact and that alone makes a broad and generic definition of theft offense.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So wouldn't it odd for this Court to decide that issue of California law?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I wouldn't think it would be odd, Justice Alito, because it is so clear. It has to do with a statutory term. It has to do with a statutory term that's defined under the California statute. Moreover, under a Taylor inquiry, Federal courts are often required to look at state law to figure out whether a particular provision is within or outside a generic definition of a crime.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course if you're right about this it would mean the statute is broader, but it would still be available to find out whether your client was in fact convicted as an accessory or as a principal.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now is that -- is it possible? Or is that out of the question in this case?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry. Is what possible?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it possible from pleading documents, from the charge, to determine whether he was convicted as an accessory or not? And if it's clear that he wasn't, then we're just wasting our sometime in arguing this point, aren't we?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I disagree. Because as an initial matter, this case in our view is about the categorical approach. But as to your question about what these documents show, no, the documents in this case do show that he was an accessory after the fact or a principal, but the Government has failed to meet its burden one way or the other.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they say you cannot be convicted as an accessory unless you are charged as such, and that the documents show he was charged as a principal.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We disagree with that characterization of the Government as we set forth in our brief. California law does not require someone to be charged with that specific -- level of specificity. And that's something we set forth in our brief. Moreover --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well how about how -- how the defendant was charged in this very case? Mr. Himelfarb thought that it was plain from that charge, that's on 13(a), that he was charged as a principal. And you must take the view that this charge, this information was inadequate to identify him as principal.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This charge is ambiguous as to whether he was charged as a driver and taker, as the principal, or as an accessory after the fact.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no, no. It says, "who at the time and place last aforesaid did willfully and unlawfully drive or take a vehicle." I mean, he is -- he's charged with being the person who took the vehicle, not, not some subsequent accessory.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, this is a question of California law.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is not a question of Cal -- it is a question of English.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I disagree, Your Honor. I mean, it's a question of California law what needs to be charged in a California charging document.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We're not saying about what needs to be charged. We're talking about what was charged. And it seems to me there's no question what was charged is that he did willfully and unlawfully drive or take a vehicle. There is no way you can consider that an accessory.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I disagree. Because under California law you need to charge generally under the statute, and the statute says drive or take. That's how he was charged. Moreover, though, under California law, the charging document does not necessarily control the conviction.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but you're -- you're saying then despite the fact that the, the indictment in this case said he willfully et cetera did this, it would be open to California to prove that in fact he didn't do any of those things, but was merely an accessory after the fact? That -- that's your position? That's what California pleading law allows?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. JUSTICE STEVENS? Do you have any case on that?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. People v West and People v Toro.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Both West and Toro.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. W-e-s-t, and People v Toro. There's also the case of Sandoval which is also cited in our brief.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does any of those cases squarely hold that he could be convicted of being an accessory after the fact on a general indictment like this?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, none of them do. They talk about the general principle under California law, about that a charging document does not necessarily control the ultimate conviction and sets forth the test that needs to be applied. But on this question --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the Government -- it is not only that. The Government has authority going the other way. People versus Prado, "in the absence of a statute, an accessory after the fact must be indicted and convicted as such." If you look at this information, it's clear that he's not being indicted as an accessory after the fact.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we think People v Prado supports our view which is a statute specifically that allows for accessory liability on its face. So, therefore, a person need not be charged under the different accessory statute. However, to the extent this Court finds the charging documents or ultimate conviction ambiguous, which it sounds like some members of the Court may believe it is, this is a question of California law, as a first point; but moreover, the question here is whether the Government has met its burden under Taylor and Shepard. And under Taylor and Shepard the inquiry is whether it can necessarily be shown that someone was convicted of a generic definition; and here, given the ambiguity under California law, it can't be said that --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what do we do about that? No, you have no interest in answering my question, but the question, it seems to me under the law, here is what I do -- and I'm a good deference lawyer, as you are. I simply look at the statute. And I imagine some very weird case that the statute could cover where the person wouldn't have the right intent or it wouldn't be theft or it would be some odd thing. There's no possibility in the world that applied to my client. But most charges are simply stated in the wording of the statute. And most judgments simply say guilty. So I say "see, you see, it is theoretically possible." And now when you decide what really happened, Court, you're supposed to look only to the charging documents in the judgment; and you can't say it didn't. So the whole congressional scheme is basically put to the side. Now what's the answer to that problem, insofar as you want to answer it?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course, I'd be happy to. I don't think it puts the whole scheme aside. Remember, the Government gets two bites at the apple here. They get a first bite on the categoric approach where all they need to show is that all the elements are within the generic definition of the crime. We'd be dealing with a different case if the person was charged under the penal code which doesn't require -- which requires intent to steal and which does not cover accessories after the fact. So the Government gets a free pass on round one. On round two, on the modified categorical approach as we're discussing here, the Government gets a second chance to -- based on actual documents in the record to establish whether there's enough there. Here the Government relies on the charging document in an abstractive judgment, but the Government does not put in a plea colloquy, it does not put in plea allocution, it does not put in any other documents that would establish under Shepard that someone was necessarily convicted of the crime. So what -- the Government here is asking to be relieved of its burden of proof which it has in this case. I would like to note that on the --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the charging document you acknowledge would suffice if it indeed is California law that in order to convict as an accessory you have to charge as an accessory? You would acknowledge this?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I would acknowledge the charging document unto itself, but not taking into account the fact that the charging document and the conviction not match. I would note, though, that the Court need not go to the modified categorical approach, and I would say should not. This is something that the board -- the agency has been able to deal with for 60 years or so, dealing with the actual documents, trying to figure out a whether particular charging document is or is not enough. In Shepard itself, which actually dealt with the question of which documents could or could not be considered, the Court did not go further and look at the next step and decide whether those particular documents did or did not meet the definition in that case. I'd also like to note to the extent that this Court finds California charging law ambiguous or hard to understand, under the principle of Jett v Dallas Independent School District, the circuit courts are in a better position to consider a matter of California State law in the first instance. So our accessory argument is that the Court should decide the categorical approach alone on the accessory after the fact ground and remand to the agency for consideration under the modified approach. I'd like to also stress that if the Court were to affirm on that ground it would be a very narrow holding. There's only two other statutes in California that expressly include accessories after the fact. California's car theft statute does not include accessories after the fact.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ In order to agree with you on the accessory point, though, don't we have to decide two disputed issues of California law? Whether accessory here in this statute means accessory after the fact, and whether if somebody is charged under that statute as an accessory, that has to be alleged specifically in the indictment, or whether it is just sufficient to charge the person with the offense.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The Court would only need to decide that first question, not the second question. The first question is what is the meaning of accessory under California law. That is sufficiently clear in our view that the Court need not send it back to the Court of Appeals. The second question under the modified approach is outside the core of what this case is about, and we suggest that that should be remanded to the Ninth Circuit or the agency.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Has anyone ever been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact to joyriding?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I do not know one way or the other, Your Honor. But I also note that we don't know whether anyone has been prosecuted under 108.51 on that ground, we also do not know whether someone has been prosecuted under Section 32, which is the accessory after the fact provision, or more generally on that ground.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if no one has ever been prosecuted as an accessory after the fact for joyriding, we'd really have to go out on a limb to construe this charging document which charges him as a principal as actually meaning to charge him as an accessory after the fact, wouldn't we?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not necessarily, because what we have is a statutory provision that clearly covers accessories after the fact. We do not have an example of someone who was charged under 108.51, but there are many reasons why that may not show up, partly because the charging documents don't need to so provide, in our view. So figuring out who was and who was not an accessory after the fact or a principal under 108.51 is not so easy to distill.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Have you been able to think of any examples where a person could have been, convicted of this statute, under the statute would he actually have been some kind of accessory to another person committing another crime, and the natural and probable consequence was that that other person would violate this statute?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Have you been able to think of one?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. So you're switching to the natural and probable consequences?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, I am.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, and I thank you for that question. Someone who, say, could aid and abet, or have the intent to aid and abet purchasing alcohol for a minor, a natural and probable consequence of that could be joyriding. I would also like to -- turning to the question of the natural and probable consequences doctrine, the government is incorrect when it states that the majority view accepts the natural and probable consequences.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are there cases that hold that the natural and probably consequences of purchasing alcohol for a minor could be joyriding?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We have not found a case on that. However --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Or anything else that somebody might do after getting intoxicated?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Partying maybe I would understand. I don't know about joyriding.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The natural and probable consequences theory cuts across a wide variety of crimes, as the government points out. So it would also cover the different provisions under the INA such as burglary, theft, and other provisions as well. The government, though, is incorrect in stating that the natural and probable consequences is a majority view. Even in its brief, the government only sets forth 22 states that it says apply that analysis. Those 22 states that the government cites, many of them do not support the proposition that it is a majority view or even applied in those states. For example, just to give a couple of examples, the government cites Missouri as a state that applies the natural and probable consequences doctrine. However in Missouri, in the very case cited by the government, People v. Evans, the court rejects the use of the natural and probable consequences doctrine and says, "The use of the natural and probable consequences doctrine was error as a matter of law." The same is true -- and that's on the same page the government cites. The same is true with respect to Maryland, where the same footnote that the government cites rejects the natural and probable consequences doctrine in favor of a narrower theory. It's also true in Idaho, Louisiana, Georgia and Texas, also do not apply the natural and probable consequences doctrine. So what, the government here is seeking to hold someone guilty of a theft offense as an aggravated felony without the requisite mens rea, and something that's a minority view of the states. Just to put this into context, under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, it's as if California passed a statute saying that in some cases someone can be guilty of burglary without the mens rea of burglary, or saying that one can be guilty of theft without the mens rea of theft.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your argument isn't limited to theft offenses, correct? That would cut across all of these areas in which the federal law refers, in which a Taylor analysis would apply?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, it would. So it would not necessarily apply to the non-Taylor provisions such as the one --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It would mean we could not rely on the categorical approach in almost any of those cases?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As -- on the first step, yes.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38484 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah, the categorical approach.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38485 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does mean that, Your Honor.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well then, what's an example of where you're held guilty on the ground that you aided and abetted natural and probable -- somebody did X and the natural and probable consequence was Y. Because after all, you are properly held guilty when you do an act and a known consequence is Y. So what's an example of that?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure. I'd be happy to give a number of examples.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ One would be good enough. The best one.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you intend to aid and abet robbery, you intend to aid and abet robbery, you can be held liable for an unintended rape of another. If you aid and abet --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a known and probable consequence? That's a probable consequence?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38491 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38492 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well then, maybe the problem is that they don't define natural and probable consequence properly.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38493 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, this is how it's applied under California law. To give another example --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38494 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Wait a minute. That's a real case?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38495 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a real case, and I'll give you the cite. People v. Banks, 2002 Westlaw 192, 720. There's another case cited in our brief, aid and abet robbery, natural probable consequence, sex offenses, that's the People v. Nguyen case. Another example, a person who has the intention to aid and abet battery, beating someone up, can be held guilty for an unintended robbery. And to show how stark this is, this is in California, it's broader than even the common law.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38496 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It sounds like the doctrine of unnatural improbable consequences. (Laughter.)
05-1629 +++$+++ 38497 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're asking us to say that not only do the states have to have the same rule, but they have to interpret the rule the same way. This would make the application of the categorical approach impossible. You'd have to look not only to the expression of the rule of law by the state courts, but to its application by the state courts in every jurisdiction. I mean, that just makes the whole enterprise infeasible, it seems to me.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What the Taylor analysis looks to is what's in the heartland of a certain crime, and here what's in the heartland of aiding and abetting. And what we have here is an aberrant doctrine of California law that is outside the mainstream.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me tell you, what's aberrant is the California interpretation of the standard doctrine that is used in many states, which is you intend the natural and probable consequences of what you do. And if California has, some California courts have come up with weird notions of that, I don't know that that destroys the uniformity among the states.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Just to briefly respond?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, sir.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. MEADE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The rule that you state is that one intends the natural and probable consequences of one's own acts. We do not dispute this rule. The question is as applied to aiding and abetting liability, and California is one of a handful of states that applies the natural and probable consequences doctrine to aiding and abetting liability, which has the novel and aberrant consequences of holding people liable even if they don't have the requisite mens rea for the offense.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Meade. Mr. Himelfarb, you have four minutes remaining.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38505 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would it be completely inconsistent with Taylor versus United States for us to say that when there is a novel or an unusual theory of potential liability such as proposed by the respondent, which would exonerate him from application of this statute, that he has the burden to show that that's what happened?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we think --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would Taylor allow us to do that sort of burden shifting?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well ultimately, Justice Kennedy, we don't think that Taylor controls on the question of what Congress's intent was under the INA. Ultimately Taylor was a question about Congress's intent in enacting the Armed Career Criminal Act, and every aspect of that decision was tied in some way to Congress's intent there. We think Congress's intent in enacting the aggravated felony provision of the INA has to be that it didn't intend that you would have these highly arcane comparisons of some general definition of aiding and abetting, which either would or wouldn't include the infinite variety of formulations of aiding and abetting.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And so your general rule to accomplish your objective would be?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's the one I suggested when I was up here earlier, which is a holding by this Court that Congress intended to include aiding and abetting liability in the aggravated felony provision, and intended to cover whatever formulations were extant in 1988 when the provision was enacted. The Court can leave open the possibility that if in some future case, some jurisdiction were to enact an extraordinarily far reaching theretofore unheard of formulation, for example, anybody who intentionally insists -- assists -- without regard to whether the person even knew about the principles of criminal conduct, could be held liable as an aider and abettor. In that circumstance, it might well be the case that a state, by adopting such a far reaching theory of aiding and abetting, would in effect forfeit the right to have any of the subsequent provisions in its criminal code treated as aggravated felonies unless the government in the immigration case could somehow prove that the alien wasn't convicted as an aider and abettor.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38511 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that, the problem I guess that I have with your argument, is that the theory of Taylor and as carried forward in Shepard was that there was a concept of a generic offense. And when aiding and abetting liability is extended in the natural and probable consequences theory, we face the fact that regardless of what the actual count is, even on your count, there isn't even a majority of states that do it. And I have difficulty seeing how that can, therefore, form an element of a generic offense when it is -- or a generic concept of the offense -- when it is a minority view.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, even under our fallback position, Justice Souter, under which you would have to come up with some general definition of aiding and abetting and then make a comparison with the law of aiding and abetting in the jurisdiction of conviction. And even if it's, you know, 20-20 or 18-18 among the states on this particular wrinkle in the law of aiding and abetting, we think it is frankly dispositive in this case, that it is the Federal rule, and my friend Mr. Meade has not disputed that. We think it's just inconceivable that Congress would have intended that in a Federal criminal case if you're charged with murder, you can be convicted under a natural and probable consequences theory such that you could conceivably spend life in prison the same way a principal would, and yet you would not be subject to the same immigration consequences as somebody convicted of the principal offense of murder, and indeed, that you wouldn't even be able -- the government wouldn't be able to --
05-1629 +++$+++ 38513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why didn't we simply take the closest Federal definition as being the touchstone?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I -- in Taylor?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that one of the problems in Taylor was that there really is no Federal definition of burglary. That's part of it. The other part of it is to some extent, the Court did rely on the Federal definition in Taylor. The original version, the original version of the office statute defined burglary, and it defined it in a generic way which was broader than the common law rule.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was Taylor an immigration case?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, it wasn't. It was a criminal case.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you are in effect, you would say that the rule should be, or the modified Taylor rule for application here should be that it's either got to fall within the concept of the Federal offense, or in default of there being a comparable Federal offense, a generic offense defined by reference to state practice?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I answer the question?
05-1629 +++$+++ 38521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Certainly.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. HIMMELFARB +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our primary submission is that in the context of aiding and abetting, there shouldn't be any generic definition beyond what the states apply, whatever the formulation. Our fallback position is essentially what you just described, and we think we should prevail under it because we think we have the Federal rule. We think we have the majority rule in the states. And we have the common law rule as well.
05-1629 +++$+++ 38523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Himmelfarb. The case is submitted.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38527 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in Case 05-1631, Scott versus Harris. Mr. Savrin.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38529 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: This case concerns whether a police officer could be held personally liable for using force to terminate a dangerous high-speed pursuit. The undisputed facts show that Deputy Scott did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Respondent had led the police officers on a nine-mile pursuit at exceptionally high speeds. As the videotapes that have been admitted in evidence show, Respondent was driving on narrow two-lane roads at night. He swerved across the double line to pass cars that were in his path, actually traveling in the wrong lane of travel. He ran through a number of red lights. He weaved through a shopping center and collided with Deputy Scott's vehicle. Deputy Scott at that point had tried to block the exit from the shopping center, but Mr. Harris was successful in using his vehicle to escape. At that point, he continued driving at exceptionally high speeds.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can I ask this question about the shopping center. Wouldn't your case be exactly the same if the shopping center incident had not occurred?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would, Your Honor.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So that we really don't have to get distracted by the shopping center?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There is a -- yes, Your Honor. There is a factual dispute as far as whether Deputy Scott's vehicle collided with Mr. Harris' vehicle or vice versa, but we do not believe that that is a material dispute. We believe that the fact, the undisputed fact, that Mr. Harris was driving at such exceptionally high rate of speeds -- and to put in context, 90 miles per hour, which is the average speed, and of course --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not sure why you concede that. I mean, I looked at the case and it seemed to me it's a case involving the whole ball of wax. And I suspect my reaction to that tape was in part affected by the fact that he went through the shopping center, came out and crashed into a police car, which is what Scott saw.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Scott -- yes, Your Honor, I think that is part of the analysis.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So how do I know whether, which of these things is directly or not indirectly -- well, you go ahead. But I mean, are you -- am I not supposed to look at the part which involves the shopping center?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely, Your Honor. My point was that, the point was that there was a collision, not who caused the collision, whether the deputy pulled into Mr. Harris' line of travel or Mr. Harris pulled towards the deputy.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is the rule that you propose that the policeman must balance the risk of harm to others versus the risk of harm to the fleeing person?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor -- yes, essentially.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your brief says that the officer reasonably believes that doing so, i.e., terminating the chase, would avoid a greater risk of bodily injury or death.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. And we believe --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Greater than what? Greater than --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Greater than not taking action. In other words, that the harm --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Without reference to the possible harm to the driver? I just want to know what you're testing.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that -- I think that is one of the factors to be considered.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know that I agree with that. I mean, if this fellow driving 90 miles an hour is responsible for endangering people, you're proposing a rule that says if there's a 50 percent chance that he'll hurt some innocent person and a 50 percent chance that he'll get hurt if you try to stop him, you shouldn't do anything. I don't agree with that.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'd stop him. I mean, he's the fellow that's causing the danger, endangerment, isn't he?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, I would agree with that.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think you're giving away too much.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ One thing I did want to point out is that a speed of 90 miles per hour -- and of course there's evidence in the record that the vehicles were at times traveling over 100 miles an hour --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I didn't mean to put words in your mouth. It seems to me your test might be whether there is a greater risk in stopping him or not stopping him as to other people, without reference to the risk to himself.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, that's probably a better articulation.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's your brief. I want you to --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that's a better articulation of what the appropriate test would be, the way --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, isn't the speed also relevant to the likelihood that -- that running into a car at that speed would cause the death of a driver?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would, Your Honor.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't it a fair high probability that if you hit someone at that speed that there will be something, either death or serious injury as a result?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38559 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, my answer to that question would be that that's always going to be the case whenever force is used to stop a vehicle at this high rate of speed.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38560 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I suppose there is also a high probability where you're going 90 miles an hour on a one-way road, crossing over the double yellow line, with oncoming traffic, that you're going to hurt somebody else.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38562 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, the more you increase the speed the more likely he's going to be hurt. But also the more likely if you let him go somebody else is going to be hurt.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. And to put it in a more complete perspective, 90 miles an hour is mathematically equivalent to over 130 feet per second.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But Mr. Savrin, there was an episode in the parking lot where things came to a temporary halt. If Scott had stopped pursuing Harris at that point, maybe Harris would not -- maybe he would have slowed down. If he was -- he was trying to flee from the police, but if the police weren't after him there is no indication that he would have been speeding.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38565 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I would disagree with that, that in fact --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38566 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, he was speeding before the police knew about him, right? That's the whole, where this all started.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38567 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The initial offense was speeding, and Mr. Harris, instead of pulling over or slowing down as would might be expected by a reasonable person, sped up and continued to drive recklessly. We would contend that it was Mr. Harris that was in control of the force that the officers need to terminate, the risk that he presented. At any time, any time, Mr. Harris could have either slowed down his vehicle or stopped, and he chose not to do that.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, do you contend that an officer can always use deadly force to stop a high-speed driver who's creating this kind of a risk?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think it depends on how you define deadly force. Of course, there can be different --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Running into him with a high probability that he'll get killed.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think that, that would be the case, as I indicated, whenever an officer uses force to stop a vehicle at this speed. I think there is -- if it is deadly force, and of course this Court has not articulated a test of that particular question --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wasn't that acknowledged in the district court, in the trial court?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In this case?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, the district court found that it did not need to resolve whether or not -- --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the jury might find that it was deadly force.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The Eleventh Circuit found that the jury might conclude it was deadly force.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And do you conclude that the jury could not find that it was deadly force?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe, again, Your Honor, I believe that it depends on how broad the test is. The Model Penal Code test, which most of the circuit courts --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but is your -- is it your view that a jury could not find on these facts that there was deadly force?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe, yes, under, under the test as articulated in some of the circuits, yes, this would not be deadly force. Of course, what we're saying is --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought we had a test for deadly force in Garner and it's whether or not there is -- it's more likely than not, whether or not there is a serious risk that death will ensue. That's the test, Garner.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, as I read the Garner opinion, the court did not need to reach a definition of deadly force because shooting someone in the back of the head is clearly going to be deadly force. The circuit courts -- I can tell you that the circuit courts in the wake of Garner have said that Garner did not create a test and have created different tests along the lines of the Model Penal Code to reach that definition. But the point -- I was going to say a point that I would like to make is that there are degrees even within the continuum that might be within a definition of deadly force, such as using a vehicle to make contact, blowing out the tires, using stop sticks, using a firearm. Those have different degrees of potential lethality, so even if they are all considered deadly force there are decisions that an officer has to make.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What test, what of deadly force would not be met here?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ A likelihood -- --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Considering that it's a summary judgment issue.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. I would say that the Third Circuit decision in the Philadelphia litigation case, where the officers dropped a bomb on a building in order to gain access and they ended up killing 11 people. The Court found that that was not deadly force because the officers were trying to gain access to the building and they reasonably believe that they were able to do that without the loss of life. I think that if that definition were applied to this case, then I think that this would not be deadly force. But I think --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Finish that.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry. I keep interrupting you.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Excuse me. He reasonably -- because Scott reasonably believed that he could bump the car off the road at 90 miles an hour without risking the driver's life? Is that why it's like the Third Circuit case?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, his intent was to end the pursuit, not to cause an accident.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but the Third Circuit case you just described didn't talk about intent. It talked about reasonable belief.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, let me cite another case then, the Adams case from the Eleventh Circuit.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Before do you that, will you go back to the Philadelphia case. Do you contend that a jury could find that he reasonably believed that he would not cause, that he would not raise a serious risk of death or serious bodily harm by bumping the car at 90 miles an hour?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. And if I --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't understand that. How could such a belief be reasonable? What am I missing here?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Let me cite the Court to the Eleventh Circuit's own reasoning in the Adams case. And that case involves a misdemeanant where the officer intentionally made contact with the vehicle several times. The last contact caused the death of a passenger. The Eleventh Circuit found that Garner did not apply to that situation and further said that a policeman's use of his vehicle is very different from a policeman's use of his gun.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That doesn't answer my question.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry, Your Honor.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why, why would it be reasonable to believe that a car could be bumped at 90 miles an hour plus without raising a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm? How could such a belief be reasonable?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because there are vehicle collisions every day, Your Honor, that do not end in death or serious bodily harm.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Some people are lucky. We're talking about creating a substantial risk. How would it be reasonable to assume that one would not create a substantial risk?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, because Mr. Harris could have regained control of his vehicle. The point is that Mister -- that the Petitioner had limited options based on the manner in which Mr. Harris was driving. Even if this would be considered deadly force, we do believe it would be justified under the circumstances.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's a different issue and you may prevail on other arguments in the case. But as to whether or not there's a likelihood or a reasonable likelihood of serious injury, it seems to me that's clearly a question for the jury. I mean, we might argue about it up here, but that's classic jury question, isn't it?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I believe in the context of the Fourth Amendment and the Graham factors and the question of probable cause, that it's not the same as simply a jury question. But I do concede that if it's not deadly force it's very close to it. But I think the important thing is that, whatever force Mister -- the Petitioner used was limited by Mr. Harris' driving.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Savrin, one technique that Officer Scott asked permission to use was described as a PIT technique that would be a life and limb-sparing measure. One oddity about this case is that he called and asked permission to use that less risky method and yet when he determined that he couldn't do that, given the speed of the vehicles, he didn't ask permission to do what he did do, which was life-endangering.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, if I could respond to that in two respects. First, it is not, it is not the case that the PIT maneuver, as it's commonly called, is safe. What it does is spin the car out, and if Mr. Harris' vehicle had been spun out in this case it is more likelihood that he would have lost control. In other words, it causes the vehicle to lose control. The second response I would have is that the Petitioner did ask permission to do the PIT maneuver and the permission that the supervisor gave, which was Mr. Faninger that's in the record undisputed, was to use force up to deadly force. So Mr. --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where is that?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's in Mark Faninger's deposition, and he is the supervisor that was --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And he said he gave permission for more than PIT procedure?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38611 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. His testimony was that he was giving, he believes he was giving permission up to and including deadly force.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38612 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the phrase used was "take him out," wasn't it?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38613 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. Yes, Your Honor.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38614 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does a police officer have any obligation in a situation like this to consider other alternatives, and if so what other alternatives might have been available to this officer?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38615 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice Stevens. I think the officer had very limited options, two options at that point: Either use force or let Mr. Harris go. And I think it was a balancing of --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And even with letting him go, isn't it possible they could get other roadblocks up ahead or get other people involved in the attempt to catch him?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, there always are other potentials. However, I would submit that a vehicle traveling at 130 feet per second can do a lot of damage in a very short period of time before the police officers can figure out what route he's going to take.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38618 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't it true that there's no traffic on the road at that particular time?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38619 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Deputy Scott took the action that he did because there was a low likelihood of injury to third parties other than to Mr. Harris because there was no one in his immediate path of travel.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38620 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, in that circumstance why wouldn't he just consider discontinuing the chase?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38621 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because there were -- the videotape shows that Mr. Harris passed approximately 36 cars during this period of time. 12 seconds before the contact was made, a vehicle was passed by Mr. Harris. There was a high likelihood, in fact a probability, that this case was going to end in tragedy, and Deputy Scott took the action that he could.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38622 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would that have been likely if the officer had discontinued the chase?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38623 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Whether he discontinued the chase or not, Mr. Harris could still injure whoever might be around the next corner, Your Honor. If there are no further questions, I'd like to save my time for rebuttal.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Savrin. Mr. Garre?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38626 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: When a suspect disobeys a lawful command to stop, races off in a reckless attempt to elude the police, and demonstrates a disregard for his own life and the lives of others in his path, the police may use force, including deadly force, to bring the suspect's vehicle flight to a halt and protect the public safety.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does it matter exactly what the nature of the escape was? Are we supposed to evaluate whether this was reckless enough? Well, let's say the driver did not go off 90 miles an hour. Let's say he obeyed the speed limit. He just wasn't going to stop. Does that make it a different case?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It does, Your Honor. The key determination is whether the officer on the scene reasonably determines that the vehicle poses a substantial risk to other motorists or the police in his way.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would think that would apply to all high-speed cases; would you not agree?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I agree that it does, Justice Kennedy. Here what you have is an individual who's going extraordinarily high speeds, 80 to 100 miles an hour. An individual who has passed cars, crossed the double, double line; there were numerous motors, motor vehicles on the night. And an individual who has ran red lights, an individual who when three police cars --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. But that was while he was being chased, right? Before being chased he hadn't done any of this. He was going 72 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone, isn't that right.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's true, Your Honor. But as the Court said in the Sacramento versus Lewis case, we don't blame police for the individual's reckless flight in that context. We don't blame police that Respondent made a decision to just --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No but if you're thinking of the likelihood of harm if they discontinued the chase, is it not reasonable to assume he might go back to going 72 miles an hour in a 55-mile zone?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not on this record, Justice Stevens. In this particular --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38635 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It would might also be reasonable to assume that anyone who was chased by the police will immediately speed up to 90 miles an hour.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38636 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's exactly right, Justice Sc alia.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't seem to me a very good rule to give to police forces: Anybody who's going 72 miles an hour, let him go. Or at least if he hits 90, let him go.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We agree, Justice Scalia. As Justice Kennedy put it Sacramento versus Lewis, if there's a real danger --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There isn't a question. There is a question of whether it justifies the use of deadly force, to prevent this -- this situation.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The question in our mind, Justice Stevens, is whether Deputy Scott reasonably believed that Respondent posed a serious risk of injury or death to other motor vehicles, bystanders or police on the roadway that night.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why are these absolute? I mean I looked at Garner and then I looked at Graham and Graham which came later said that all claims that officers have used excessive force, deadly or not, should be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment and its reasonableness standard. So I guess -- isn't that right, isn't that the law?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We agree, Your Honor.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right, if that's the law, then whether -- of course an automobile could, could kill people. Of course it can. So can a lot of things. But an automobile isn't a gun, and a chase on the highway is not a chase through a back yard, though both could end up with the person being chased dead. So aren't we supposed to look at all the circumstances, including the circumstance of what -- one that interests me, one, is that the right standard? Two, did Scott know that the reason he was chasing this person was because he had violated a speed limit, or was he ignorant of the reason why the individual was racing away at 90 miles an hour, which is as far as the record could show?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer, to answer the second question first, Scott did not know that he was initially in a chase.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And a reasonable juror could not conclude to the contrary?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Scott, I believe, Scott's testimony was that he did not know. What Scott knew, and he was engaged in the chase, was this is an individual who had crossed cars, crossed the double yellow line. This was an individual who had ran red lights. This was an individual, when three police squad cars converged on him in the shopping center parking lot, collided with them and ran off into the highway, reaching again speeds up to 90 miles an hour.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it reasonable for him to suppose that there might be something more going on if the guy is trying this hard to get away from a speeding ticket? That presents he presents a danger to the community quite apart from the driving?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is that a factor that goes into the analysis?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is, certainly, at a commonsense level. Statistic show that most vehicles who flee in this fashion, oftentimes there is alcohol or drug abuse involved, oftentimes they are stolen vehicles. We don't think --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What if they knew there were drugs in the car that he would dispose of if he had got caught. Would that justify this using deadly force?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not sure that it would, Justice Scalia -- uh, Justice Stevens.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm rather clear it would not, isn't it? Because that would be no more serious than the crime in Garner, would it?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well -- that's true. The key, the key point about this case is the threat that Respondent posed in the -- suspects who engage in high speed vehicle chases pose to the public, and that is, that is fundamentally different from Garner for the reason that you mentioned. Garner involved --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But your position would be the same even if Scott knew that the only reason they were trying to stop him initially was the speeding violation?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. It doesn't matter why the chase began. The point is that when Scott made the decision to use force against Respondent, he reasonably determined that Respondent posed a grave threat to other motorists, the police and any bystanders who might come in his way.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why, why wouldn't it matter? I mean, other things being equal, suppose that he known that all that happens, suppose he was two miles beyond the speed limit. And Scott knew the whole thing or Scott was the one who did it, and he says maybe he is a young kid who is frightened and he has his license number and he could get him later. I mean, why wouldn't it be nutty to -- to try to bump somebody off the road, when all, that's all that's at stake?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because, Your Honor, regardless of the reason the chase began, at the moment that Deputy Scott used the force, this car posed a serious risk to everyone else on the road that night. Someone traveling 90 miles an hour, up to 90 miles an hour, on a two-lane windy road with numerous cars passing during this course of the chase, it was that threat that Deputy Scott acted against when he used that force, and that was a reasonable use of force. It's reasonable regardless of whether or not this Court determines --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do you deal with the Brower case? That it was a 193 -- 83 action against the police for setting up a roadblock to catch a speeder. And the Court said that the roadblock was enough to give rise to a 1983 claim?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, the holding in that case was that a roadblock amounted to a seizure. And we don't, no one disputes there was a seizure in this case when Deputy Scott intentionally used force to put Respondents off the road. So it respect, Brower doesn't speak to the question in this case, which is whether or not that use of force was reasonable under the circumstances. Justice Kennedy in the Sacramento versus Lewis case, in his concurring opinion, say that there was a real danger of adopting a constitutional rule that suspects are free to disobey lawful commands.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I just make this one point? Is it correct that the issue is whether it's reasonable or is the issue whether a jury could find it unreasonable?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. GARRE +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the -- ultimately to determine whether this decision could be made at the summary judgment stage you would have to consider whether a jury could find it unreasonable. Here, on the relevant undisputed facts, we submit as a matter of law, Deputy Scott reasonably believed that this force was necessary under the circumstances. And the final point that I wanted to make, going back to Justice Kennedy's concurrence, is that there is a real danger in adopting that kind of constitutional rule, that it will encourage more suspects to flee, and will only increase the danger to the public and to police and to motorists in these high speed chases. I would urge this Court to reverse the decision below. If there are no further questions --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Garre. Mr. Jones.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38665 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. I'd like to begin by responding to some of the questions that were asked of Petitioner. First of all, Officer Scott himself admitted in his testimony that he knew at the time that he was using deadly force, and he realized at the time that he was likely to cause injury or -- death or serious injury to Mr. Harris.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there any doubt that Mr. Harris was likely to cause death or serious injury to the other cars on the highway that he was passing?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Harris was simply a -- an unsafe driver. There is always a risk at driving in excess of speed limit, driving in violation of traffic laws. But that risk in and of itself is not --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We are not talking about driving in violation of traffic laws. We talking about 90 miles an hour on a two-lane highway, swerving past cars in the incoming traffic --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we're talking --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Hitting -- after hitting Officer Scott's car and continuing on. That's a little more than just unsafe.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, those are not the facts before the Court, Mr. Chief Justice. The facts are that he was driving fast but he was under control. He only crossed the center line to pass and when he passed, he used his turn signal when he passed.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He used the turning signal. That's like the strangler who observes the no smoking sign. (Laughter.)
05-1631 +++$+++ 38673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ When he turned into the -- when he turned into the shopping center he wasn't weaving through a parking lot. He was going through a private access road in a shopping mall which was closed at 11 o'clock at night. And the collision, the impact occurred when Officer Scott, who was going too fast to make the turn into the shopping center, went up to the next intersection, came around the other way to head my client off at the pass. And then what happened was that Mr. Harris took evasive action to a avoid collision when Mr. Harris -- excuse me when Officer Scott -- put himself right in Mr. Harris' way.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Jones, I looked at the videotape on this. It seemed to me that he created a tremendous risk of drivers on that road. Is that an unreasonable way of looking at the -- at this tape?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He created the scariest chase I ever saw since "The French Connection." (Laughter.)
05-1631 +++$+++ 38676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is frightening.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As a --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ A frightening amount of speed, and cars coming in the opposite direction, at night, on a two-lane windy road --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, as the Court below found, and as the tape indicates, Mr. Harris didn't run anybody off the road. He didn't ram anybody. He didn't try to ram anybody. He was just driving away.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The question was whether he was creating a substantial risk doing that.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He was creating --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And my, my question is how could a jury find otherwise? Your answer up to this point is that well, he used signal lights and his reflexes were good, and they sure were. But the question is whether he was creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm to others. And my question is leaving -- assuming that his reflexes were good and he knew how to use the signal lights, how could the jury fail to find that he was creating such a risk?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the jury could certainly find he's creating a risk. But with regard to the other Garner factors that must be shown before deadly force can be used, he had not committed a violent felony, a crime involving the infliction or threat of infliction --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Garner was not talking about someone who at the time the deadly force was used was himself creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily harm to others. That's what we are dealing with here. And the reasonableness of the officer's action depends on whether, at the summary judgment stage, a jury can reasonably find that, in fact, he was not creating at that moment, a substantial risk of serious bodily harm or death to others. And my question is, how could a jury find anything else?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, a jury could find that the pursuit by the officer escalated the risk rather than diminishing the risk to others. And that given a choice between using deadly force to terminate a pursuit where the officer himself had escalated the risk versus backing off, letting the offender escape and then perhaps arresting him an hour later at the house.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did Scott, know that? Did Scott -- Do you have evidence to show that Scott knew that the underlying offense was a speeding violation?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We have evidence that it was called out on the radio. "I'm pursuing somebody." Whether Scott knew we don't know.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And Scott has testified he didn't know it.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Scott has testified he --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, do you think you can get to the jury on the question of whether he knew it.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Scott --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'd like a yes or no answer.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The testimony --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That doesn't sound like yes or no.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not certain I understand the question.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The question is, can you get to the jury on the question of whether Scott knew that the underlying offense was for speeding?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Scott did not know that was it.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. If Scott didn't know it, I mean, my goodness, then I don't see the relevance of whether it was speeding or not. And I was with you when I read the -- the opinion of the court below. And I read the other brief. I was on the other side. Then I've been shifting back and forth. Then I look at that tape, and I have to say that when I looked at the tape, my reaction was somewhat similar to Justice Alito's. And so if it's doubtful and then you can't even show that the person who did it knew that this was for speeding rather than for murder, how can you get to the jury?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, there is certainly a credibility issue as to whether Scott says he knew or didn't know. I mean, certainly the call on the radio he could have acquired. The thing is that --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, as the Chief Justice indicated through a question earlier, isn't it reasonable for an officer to assume that it is -- he is trying to escape because there is something more serious than speeding at stake? I mean, that's the assumption I would draw.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That assumption would not be based upon probability or based upon police training. Officers in pursuit situations are trying to believe --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You mean just as many people take off in high speed chases for speeding as for serious crimes?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The vast majority have committed minor crimes. And it's not a rational --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But at the moment Scott came into this case, what difference does that make? Why is that even relevant? Let's assume Scott knew that this entire situation had eventuated out of an 18 mile in excess of speed act by the individual. Assume that. What Scott also knew at the point at which he joined the chase was that this individual was driving a car at 90 miles an hour. He was crossing yellow lines, going through red lights, et cetera. At that point, wasn't the only legally relevant data whether or not Harris was creating the risk of death or bodily harm to others?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's the issue. Was there an immediate risk of death or serious bodily harm --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you agree that whether Scott knew or didn't know, that this whole scenario had eventuated out of a speeding situation was irrelevant?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not relevant. It's relevant to that termination. Yeah, the issue is, is there an immediate risk. But one of the factors that is significant is what is the severity of the underlying crime. And if it is a crime of violence, then certainly the officer is entitled to presume --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's exactly where I started. And I wondered -- that's what I'm uncertain about the standard for this. Because as you and the others have been arguing, if the question is one about rules surrounding the use of deadly force. But then when I read what I read out to you, in Graham, it seemed to me that Graham, which comes after Garner, says that's not the standard. Graham is a standard of simple reasonableness and Garner is simply an illustration of that as applied to guns and a backyard chase, not as applied to cars which threaten other people much more.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's a good question.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what is the standard? Am I supposed to apply -- am I not supposed to apply Graham?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, whether you apply Garner or Graham, the result is the same in this case. And let me explain why. What Graham did is it expanded the Garner rule, which you can't use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect who is merely fleeing, expanded that to include the entire range of use of force, deadly or nondeadly. And with regard to the factors that are to be considered in determining whether the use of force is reasonable under Graham, the balance with respect to a fleeing suspect who is subjected to deadly force was already drawn by Garner. Garner created a bright light rule. Graham extended that to an ad hoc balancing test with all use of force applications. But with respect to deadly force and a fleeing suspect, Garner still provides a bright line rule.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So you're saying I cannot do the following under the law, which would seem to be contrary to common sense, to say there is a big difference between a policeman shooting a person who is running away and threatens no harm to others, and a policeman using a gun -- using a car on a highway to try to get a person to stop who is threatening others. I have to treat those exactly as if they were the same thing.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. And Garner, this Court's decision in Garner and this Court's decision in Brower, which was written by Justice Scalia, basically to quote Brower in both cases. In the Brower versus County of Inyo --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The Eleventh Circuit gave the exact opposite answer in the Adams case, which if you're looking at what the -- was clearly established law from the point of view of the officer that provides him guidance that the Garner case does not dictate a result in the use of deadly force in the police chase case involving an automobile.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the holding of the Adams versus St. Lucie County case was that in 1985, an incident which occurred six weeks after the Garner decision and four years before the Brower decision, there is no way the officers could have known at that time that their act of ramming a police car to prevent an escape of another fleeing vehicle would have been considered deadly force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. As the dissent pointed out in the, in the Adams case, though, certainly as of the Court's decision in 1993, this was now clearly established. You had Brower saying that it's a seizure, and then you had this Court saying that now the law was clearly established where it wasn't before --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38716 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So when Officer Scott was trying to figure out what the law was, he should have relied on the dissent in the case?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38717 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, another case came about later which held that as early as 1998 in another case involving the same department, that there was clearly established law.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38718 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was there any case at the time of the action in this case, any decision that said ramming, ramming a car to end a chase violates the Fourth Amendment?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38719 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Brower versus County of Inyo says --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38720 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Brower was a roadblock case.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38721 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was a roadblock which produced a collision, a physical impact between vehicles. And that was the -- that was the distinction which Justice Scalia latched onto in that case, and said that the mere fact that the person was fleeing by car in Brower was no different than the burglar fleeing by foot in Garner. Either one of them --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the issue in the case was quite simply whether there had been a seizure. Isn't that the issue?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That was the first holding. The second holding was that the Plaintiff had sufficiently claimed a cause of action on the seizure. And then it went back to the lower court to be considered under the Garner analysis. And what I liked about your decision -- excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Go ahead. Finish your --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What I liked about your decision in that case, Justice Scalia, was that you said that the officer's culpability for using excessive force is not diminished by the fact that perpetrator chose to continue running, whether it was the fleeing burglar in Garner or the fleeing driver in Brower. Excuse me, Mr. Chief Justice.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I could just get back to an earlier point. You think what the officer should have done in this case was to let Mr. Harris go.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That was one option. He could have continued the pursuit and simply decided not to mow him off the road at 90 miles an hour, or he could have stopped a pursuit and let him go which often happens in many pursuits.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Even though he doesn't know at that point that he will ever be able to arrest him later. He doesn't know if it's a stolen car or not.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38730 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And he doesn't know why he is being pursued, whether it's for mass murder or terrorism or anything else.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38731 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's correct. But in the majority of cases -- and this is the only testimony in this record, Your Honors. Our experts testified on a study -- based on a study which was commissioned for him by the Department of Justice, a study which has been cited by some of the amicus briefs on both sides in this case, Dr. Albert testified that 70 percent of the time, when police back off pursuit, the perpetrator stops running and they resume safe driving. And when the car is stolen, most of the time --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38732 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Once they have gotten away, I assume.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38733 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, sometimes you have to let them get away. In Garner, it says, even if the guy has just broken into somebody's house in the middle of the night and committed a felony, if the choice is letting them go or using deadly force when the factors authorizing deadly force are not present, you have to let him go.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not if he is shooting his way out of the house and endangering other people.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, that's a factor here, of course. If he has taken the jewelry and he's gone off into the night, if shooting at him might endanger somebody else, or even kill him, you have to let him go. I'm talking about a burglar who is, you know, who is shooting as he leaves.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You can shoot him. I'd be there shooting him, too.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course you can shoot him.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me take that distinction and apply it to the vehicle, Justice Scalia. What we have to have to authorize deadly force in this context is something more than just unsafe flight. You've got to have someone who is behaving violently, who is menacing people, trying to ram people.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can you tell me as of the time he exited the parking lot, by that point, had he committed any felonies?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. All he had done was taken evasive action to avoid an officer who --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ 90 miles an hour would not be a felony, not a reckless driving?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are you talking about the traffic pursuit?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, none of those are felonies under Georgia law.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38746 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ At no point did he commit a felony?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38747 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Your Honor. It's not even a felony in Georgia.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38748 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But he certainly committed a lot of --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38749 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If he had intended to hit the police officer, was it --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If he had intended to hit the police officer, if that was shown by the evidence, so they could have charged with aggravated assault. They didn't do that. They left traffic citations in his hospital room. They never arrested him. They never prosecuted him.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The key point is that he is endangering the lives and safety of others. Anyone who has watched that tape has got to come to that conclusion, looking at the road and the way that this car was swerving, and the cars coming in the opposite direction. This was a situation fraught with danger.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, I hope I don't have you on my jury if that's -- but what the trial court found was that construing the facts in a light most favorable to the Plaintiff as a nonmoving party, that reasonable jurors can find that this was simply a person who was driving fast. This was not a person who was driving assaultively. He wasn't driving violently. He wasn't a threat to anyone that would authorize the use of deadly force against him.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is that a factual finding of the, of the trial court here?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is a factual finding.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38755 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Are we bound by that fact?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38756 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We are bound by that. This is an interlocutory appeal, this an interlocutory appeal under Mitchell v. Forsythe, and the Court is bound by its own ruling to accept the facts as found by the court below, and decide the narrow issue of law here which is, one, is there a constitutional violation on these facts. And two, was the law clearly established.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Even if having watched the tape, there is no way that, that factual finding can be accurate?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you want to repeal Johnson v. Jones and Mitchell v. Forsythe, then yes. This is the Supreme Court. You can make that determination. But based upon the prior rulings of this Court, this Court is bound to accept the findings of fact of the courts below, and then to determine solely the legal issue on an interlocutory basis. The bottom line issue here, Your Honors, is whether the fact that someone is driving in violation of traffic laws in and of itself can be justification for the use of deadly force.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't see how -- I mean, you know, given our prior discussion here, I don't see how that's the issue. Because you say we have to assume that the Defendant here didn't know that, in fact, all that was at issue was a violation of the traffic law.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm not talking about the underlying violation here. I'm talking about the conduct observed by the officer who made the decision to use deadly force.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That conduct -- it could be conduct -- you could say exactly your same question, just as the Chief just said. I mean, I don't know how to get around this. You could say the question was, does a person who reasonably thinks he might be being pursued for a murder --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This is the issue. This is the issue. If what this person is doing is driving, say driving unsafely, but they are not driving violently, they are not driving aggressively, they are not menacing anyone on the road. They are simply driving fast trying to get away, that in and of itself, is that going to be justification for the use of deadly force or is something more going to be required?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ When someone is fleeing and creating a grave danger, let's just assume that that's the case, creating a very danger for other drivers on the road, when in your view is it reasonable for the police to use deadly force to stop that, as opposed to breaking off the chase? What, what is the test.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, under Garner the test is they have to be threatening violence or inflicting violence against someone. There have to be no other alternatives other than deadly force available to effect the apprehension. And assuming there is justification for deadly force, then there is a duty to give a warning where feasible before using deadly force. And the court below felt none of those three factors --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ How could you possibly give a warning in this situation?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's academic in this case, because the first two factors were not met. I mean, it's our position that you don't worry about giving a warning unless you have the right to use deadly force, and if you don't get to that point then it's -- it's a moot question.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38767 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why wasn't there warning? There were lights, there were sirens. Surely the defendant knew that the police were trying to stop him.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38768 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There was certainly warning that he needed -- that he was expected to pull over. There was no warning of any intent to use deadly force.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What am I -- you said factually. What am I supposed to assume? You said in light of -- I mean, I looked at the tape and that tape shows he is weaving on both sides of the lane, swerving around automobiles that are coming in the opposite direction with their lights on, goes through a red light where there are several cars that are right there, weaves around them, and there are cars coming the other way, weaves back, goes down the road. Now, what in fact -- am I supposed to pretend I haven't seen that? What am I supposed to pretend to here?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I didn't see that.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You didn't see that?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You didn't -- I thought that -- you didn't see that?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the point is most people use the word weaving to describe the motion of Mr. Harris's car is when they are going through the, the shopping center --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, no. I -- what I saw is he is driving down one lane, what I mean by weaving, and this lane goes with me in traffic. And there is some cars in front of him, so he goes in the other lane where the cars are now coming right directly at him. And then before they hit him, he goes back to the first lane and he does this while going through a red light, it seemed to me. Am I -- did I mis-see that? I'll go look at it again if you --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- feel free to look at it again.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But those are not the facts that were found by the court below in this --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well that's, that's what I wonder. If the court says that isn't what happened, and I see with my eyes that is what happened, what am I supposed to do?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think you apply the law, Your Honor.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The district -- (Laughter.)
05-1631 +++$+++ 38782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Under, under -- under your rule, what you're concerned with is the bumping, the use of the force. Under your rule, if the police continue the chase without using the, without trying to ram him, and then there is an accident and innocent people are killed, or injured, I assume that under the tort laws of most states, the police could be liable.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38783 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well in theory perhaps they could be if the officer was a joint proximate cause of the accident, but in most states --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38784 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, aren't they the proximate cause if they continue the chase without trying to terminate it?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. If the officer terminates the chase then he is never going to be liable because number one he is acting prudently; he is going based upon Department of Justice studies showing 70 percent --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. No. Well, I meant terminate the chase by -- by -- by forcing him off the road.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if he terminates the chase using deadly force, that that creates a whole host of other problems.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But isn't there -- but isn't that one way to assure that the police are not liable, both from a moral standpoint and a legal standpoint, for causing the injury of other people?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now from a constitutional standpoint the Fourth Amendment doesn't protect other people. It protects those who have been seized. And that's, that's the framework we are dealing with here today.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38790 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you mean it's irrelevant to our analysis to consider that he might injure other people?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38791 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The potential for danger to others is certainly part of the justification for deadly force, just as, if deadly force cannot be used endangering other people, then that certainly goes into the matrix, too.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38792 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Jones, could I --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38793 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yeah.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38794 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Could I ask whether the portion of the opinion that you say establishes that he was not endangering anybody is this portion? The court is mindful that traffic laws are designed to -- safely -- and Harris acted in an unsafe manner. However, the record reflects" -- - is this the portion?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38795 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- "that he maintained control over his vehicle." Well, that doesn't prove he's not endangering anybody. "Used his turn signals" -- wonderful. (Laughter.)
05-1631 +++$+++ 38797 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ "And did not endanger any particular motorist on the road." I think that's true. In that scary chase he, he didn't come close to hitting any particular car, but I don't think that's, that's a finding that he was not endangering anybody. "Any particular motorist," but he was endangering the public at large.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38798 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, this is my point is that if, if the drive -- if the hazard caused by driving in and of itself is the only threat here, does that rise to a level of imminency and immediacy that justifies the use of deadly force? If it does, then any officer who perceives that someone is driving unsafely and that they may cause an accident to someone who may or may not be down the road if not stopped, would be justified in using deadly force, to literally take out anyone who is speeding.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38799 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It depends on how fast -- if depends on how fast the car is going, whether it's a two-lane road or four-lane divided highway. All those factors come into, into account. And it doesn't seem to me that we have to adopt a rule that will, that will discourage police officers. There's, there's enough disincentive to engage in this kind of activity in the fact that the police officer may hurt himself. It's pretty risky to conduct this kind of a maneuver, don't you think? I wouldn't have done it if I was Scott.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38800 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well that's --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38801 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I would have let the guy go.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38802 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now what he, if he --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38803 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Driving 90 miles an hour and comes up, approaches that car, that car swerved. Scott could have been killed, couldn't he?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38804 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely. Or because he's also --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38805 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So I don't think we need a whole lot of disincentive to stop police officers in engaging in frolicsome conduct.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38806 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, not only that, Justice Scalia. The officer had no control over what was going to happen once he used deadly force, like the officer who fired into the cab of a flying vehicle in Barn v Cox, once you disable the driver the car keeps going. And in this case, when you -- when you hit the vehicle and knock a vehicle that has been in control and make it out of control, then it's now an unguided missile that could just as easily cross the center line and hit an innocent person.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38807 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me just ask this question. In trying to assess the likelihood of harm to innocent people who would be hurt by this by this guy driving so fast, is that, do we measure it by assuming that the chase will continue? Or do we measure it by assuming that the chase would be discontinued?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The officer --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38809 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Just as we did in Garner?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38810 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The officer has both options. I mean Garner simply commands that he not use deadly force if it's a choice between letting him go and using deadly force. Now in the Sacramento v Lewis case, it does say that involves a different, a different type of claim and a different standard. But in the Sacramento case it does say that an officer in a pursuit has a duty to always be weighing the risk of the continued pursuit against the risk to the public. So there is an independent duty there to act reasonably.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38811 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If it were -- clear that a jury could find that there would be no unreasonable risk to innocent motorists if they discontinued the chase -- assume that's a possible finding. If that were true, would there be a duty to discontinue the chase?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38812 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not under the Fourth Amendment. Now, the -- the only expert testimony in this record on that subject says there is a 7 percent chance --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38813 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You're saying there is a duty not to use deadly force.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38814 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's what Garner says, if you don't use deadly force. And that's what our claim is.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And aren't you concerned that that creates an incentive in every case for anyone who, that sees the blue lights behind them to know that all they have to do is keep fleeing and the police are going to have to give up eventually?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, let me respond by reading a portion of Garner that deals with that point, Mr. Chief Justice. These, these same important policy reasons were raised in Garner, that we don't want to encourage disobedience of issues. We want to discourage people from fleeing. And this is what the Garner Court said --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Garner -- Garner was the case involving shooting the guy in the back, right?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. He might easily break into someone else's house and perhaps end up killing them. This was a vigorous dissent in Garner. But this is what the majority said: "Without in any way disparaging the importance of these goals we are not convinced that the use of deadly force is a sufficiently productive means of accomplishing them to justify the killing of nonviolent suspects." And if unsafe driving --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But your, your answer to Justice Stevens as I understand it was the police not have the duty to discontinue the chase? The obverse of that is that the police may prolong the chase, i.e., prolong the injury to the public. I'm surprised at your answer.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38820 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think there is an independent duty, it doesn't rise under the Fourth Amendment, but there is an independent duty to do that. But my concern is that under Garner, given a choice between --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38821 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It is certainly the case that if there is going to be a, a risk of deadly harm to innocent third parties, there would be a duty to discontinue the chase rather kill him. But you don't seem to buy that.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, experience shows most of the time when you discontinue a chase, the person who is running discontinues driving unsafely. That is the -- that is experience. This officer's own policy says that --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did this study show what future fleeing speeders would do? I mean, I will accept that for, for the sake of argument that -- in fact, it's probably true. I would have guessed that, if the police stopped chasing, you don't go 90 miles an hour anymore. But did this study show what the effect of a rule that says stop chasing when he hits 85, what the effect of that rule would be on, on fleeing speeders or fleeing felons, or fleeing anybody?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. JONES +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, the rule simply says you don't kill him just because he is driving unsafely. And if, it simply says that if the choice is between killing him and letting him go, you have to let him go if the Garner factors aren't present. And we find nothing in the law and no reason to create a new exception in the law that says that Garner doesn't apply if you're fleeing by vehicle. Thank you. We ask that the Court of Appeals be affirmed.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Jones. Mr. Savrin, you have four minutes remaining.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38827 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. Let me refocus for a moment that in order for the officer to be denied qualified immunity in this context a jury would have to be able to find two things. One, that no -- that there was no probable cause, and second, that that was clearly established. And I think that the discussion this morning if nothing else shows that it's not clearly established. As far as the Fourth Amendment is concerned, I think the measure needs to be exactly as this Court stated in Graham versus Connor, which is looking at the facts from the standpoint of the officer on the scene, because after all, he has to make split-second decisions. He does not have the benefit of taking depositions of Mr. Harris --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What am I supposed to do? I mean, I'll look again at the tape. I certainly will do that. But suppose I look at the tape and I end up with Chico Marx's old question with respect to the Court of Appeals: Who do you believe, me or your own eyes?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I think the answer to that question was provided in this decision in Ornelas versus United States, a decision by this Court in 1996 that came up in the context of a criminal, a direct criminal appeal involving the question of probable cause. And this Court set forth very clearly that the historical facts are given deference. The question of, a legal question about whether those facts reasonably give rise to probable cause is an independent de novo review.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Whether he is endangering anybody is a historical fact, no? So what do you do about that finding?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't believe that is historical fact.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The historical facts here are whether Mr. Harris was driving excessively, whether he was driving across the line, whether he was driving at high rates of speed, whether there was anybody in his path, whether he had collided with anyone. I think the question about whether or not those facts give rise to probable cause to believe that Harris was a threat of serious physical harm is a legal issue, and I think the Court of Appeals recognized that in this case when they applied a different analysis or came out with a different result to those same undisputed facts.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What is the, the court saying -- and this is on page 39 A of the petition appendix -- when Harris was driving away from officers and when there, when there were no other motorists or pedestrians nearby, thus casting doubt on defendant's assertion that at the time of the ramming, Harris posed an immediate threat of harm to others. This is a finding that there were no other motorists or pedestrians nearby when the ramming occurred.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that is a fact that we accept as true in the immediate vicinity. The tape shows that there was a vehicle just 12 seconds before, and I think that a reasonable officer at the time would believe that that wasn't going to be the last vehicle on that road.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would hope he would wait until there were no pedestrians or vehicles coming before he, before he did the ramming.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I assume he waited precisely for that kind of a gap in the traffic?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. Exactly. He had limited options and I believe it was a no-win scenario. And he took the best course that he reasonably believed he could at the time. And --
05-1631 +++$+++ 38840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you agree with Mr. Jones' statement that none of Mr. Harris' conduct rose to the level of a felony?
05-1631 +++$+++ 38841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SAVRIN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would not, Your Honor. In our brief we did list a number of felonies that Mr. Harris, that we believe he committed. But I would go back to Garner, and Garner says that an armed suspect would have been a different case. And Garner also says that some misdemeanors such as drunk driving are more dangerous that some felonies such as white collar crime. So I think the question should not be whether it's a technical issue of crossing the line from misdemeanor to felony, but the harm that is being caused by the continued driving that's exactly what occurred in this case. And if I could respond to Justice Breyer's question about what to do in terms of responding to Mr. Marx's question, I think the Ornelas case says that you would review it for clear error. And in this case you would not owe deference of a finding of fact by the lower court.
05-1631 +++$+++ 38842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Savrin. The case is submitted.
05-18 +++$+++ 38847 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument first in Arlington Central School District Board of Education v. Murphy. Mr. Kuntz.
05-18 +++$+++ 38849 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The statute awarding attorneys' fees as part of the costs to the prevailing parents provides a clear rule, imposes a certain obligation. It should not be expanded to include fees for expert witnesses. This is a case of statutory construction. Under longstanding rules, statutes are construed by first looking at the words of the statute. Is the meaning plain? If so, the inquiry stops there. This statute is unambiguous. Expert fees are not a part of attorneys' fees. Expert fees are not costs. The statute contains no reference to expert fees. They are not shifted to the school district when the parents prevail. It's our belief that the lack of compensation for experts is an intentional exclusion and omission from the statute. Congress knows how to add expert fees in a cost-shifting statute, and that omission is telling here. In that context, I think it's important to draw the Court's attention to the origin of the statute. It was in response to this Court's decision in Smith against Robinson. At the time that Smith against Robinson was heard, the EHA was often grafted onto other causes of action as a pleading device to -- in an attempt to ensure that attorneys' fees flowed to the prevailing party at the conclusion of the case. So cases were brought not only under the -- the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, but also under 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and under 1983 as well of -- on the theory that these were equal protection claims brought under the Fourteenth Amendment. In Smith against Robinson, this Court made it clear that the avenue that had to be followed by the parents was exclusively that of -- of the remedy provided under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. In response to that decision of the Court, as my opponent points out in his brief -- I think it was 19 days later -- bills were introduced into Congress to remedy what Congress at that point saw was a -- a lack of coverage for fees for attorneys for the prevailing parties in cases under the -- under the act. So it's no -- no great surprise that what Congress did in that instance was to take the language that appears in section 1988 and, in effect, lift it and put it into the -- into the act, into what we now call the IDEA. And it's very clear that in doing so, it limited the right of recovery to attorneys' fees, and that right does not include the expert fees advocated by the Respondents here this morning.
05-18 +++$+++ 38850 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think the right includes any costs other than statutory costs, any expenses?
05-18 +++$+++ 38851 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, it does not, Your Honor.
05-18 +++$+++ 38852 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do you explain the reference to expenses on page 4 of the red brief which quotes from the -- a section of the statute authorizing a report to be made, a report authorized under? They shall include data about the specific amount of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses. Why do you suppose they put the word expenses in?
05-18 +++$+++ 38853 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it said attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses.
05-18 +++$+++ 38854 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
05-18 +++$+++ 38855 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And it's a direction to --
05-18 +++$+++ 38856 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So the expenses must be something other than attorneys' fees or costs.
05-18 +++$+++ 38857 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they could be expenses of the attorney. But if they were to be -- be set aside separately, that's no indication that -- that Congress intended that expenses of other individuals be shifted to the cost -- shifted, rather, to the school district. It's a direction to the GAO to acquire data --
05-18 +++$+++ 38858 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right.
05-18 +++$+++ 38859 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- for future reference by -- by Congress.
05-18 +++$+++ 38860 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, what about -- may I just take the question one step further? I think it's in a subsequent clause in that same section requiring the GAO report that it refers to the -- the -- I forget whether -- the expenses of consultants. Why was the word consultant in there? Because as -- as I understand it, a consultant would not be covered by the costs -- the general costs statute.
05-18 +++$+++ 38861 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I believe that's correct. That's in -- in subdivision (B).
05-18 +++$+++ 38862 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is it? Is it? I thought the -- there was a reference to hours of consultants, but not expenses.
05-18 +++$+++ 38863 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There are two subdivisions: subdivision (A) and subdivision (B). Subdivision (A) says attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses -- expenses, and in subdivision (B), it refers to consultants. But there isn't any --
05-18 +++$+++ 38864 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I would have thought that your answer would be that the Congress was interested in finding out the cost of this act, and it's very clear that school districts hire consultants to assist them in -- in these cases, and it wanted to know the amount they were paying to the consultants. And that's also why it used the word personnel, which -- which is a word usually reserved for a government agency.
05-18 +++$+++ 38865 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I believe Your Honor is correct in that it -- it's a direction by the GAO to acquire data. And I believe we argued that point in our brief, just as Your Honor has expressed it. We think that that direction to the GAO, however, does not relate back particularly and -- and certainly doesn't inform this Court or inform the statute that expert's fees are to be included and shifted over to the -- to the school district.
05-18 +++$+++ 38866 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But does it make it possible to read -- I mean, I agree with you it doesn't say to do that, but I guess you could read it to do that, couldn't you? I mean, you said the word cost wasn't ambiguous.
05-18 +++$+++ 38867 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under this statute.
05-18 +++$+++ 38868 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Maybe you might be right, maybe absolutely, but might you also be wrong? How is it not ambiguous? It might cover -- it might cover the fees of consultants. It might be that the argument you made is right, but it also mightn't.
05-18 +++$+++ 38869 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I think this Court has looked at that issue in -- in two separate cases, and one of those cases is Crawford Fitting and the other is --
05-18 +++$+++ 38870 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which involved this statute?
05-18 +++$+++ 38871 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it didn't involve this --
05-18 +++$+++ 38872 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. Well, I mean, we have a statute and they're using the word costs in the statute, and whatever they used in some other statute they might have meant something different in this statute. And my question is simply how do we know they didn't by just reading the word five times, particularly since, in fact, if you look at another part of the statute, they do seem to use the word cost to include number of hours spent by personnel, including consultants, and the expenses incurred. I mean, can you say -- is there a dictionary that says the word costs couldn't include that?
05-18 +++$+++ 38873 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, it -- it could, but I --
05-18 +++$+++ 38874 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, once you say it could, then possibly it's reasonable to ask what the Congress Members were actually thinking, and as soon as we look at what they were actually thinking, that's perfectly clear. Isn't it? Because both the conference report and the Senate report say absolutely clearly that they intended this kind of expense to be used, which is why the GAO went out and did all the studies to include it.
05-18 +++$+++ 38875 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But we come back to the historical derivation of how this statute came into -- into being, and it did come in in response to Smith against Robinson.
05-18 +++$+++ 38876 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought the GAO study included not just the -- the hours worked and the -- the costs, however you choose to define it, on the part of the parent challenging the school board action, but it also included those hours and those costs expended by the school.
05-18 +++$+++ 38877 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, it does.
05-18 +++$+++ 38878 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In which case it could not possibly have been directed to what items are compensable.
05-18 +++$+++ 38879 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We think that's a separate section.
05-18 +++$+++ 38880 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ On its face, it covers at least half of the items that are not compensable.
05-18 +++$+++ 38881 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's true, Your Honor.
05-18 +++$+++ 38882 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's true, but --
05-18 +++$+++ 38883 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't it true that the provision I referred to refers to the specific amount of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party? So it's definitely referring to expenses incurred by the -- by the plaintiff. Isn't that true?
05-18 +++$+++ 38884 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I -- that's correct.
05-18 +++$+++ 38885 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-18 +++$+++ 38886 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I think there are expenses that -- that the attorney bears in -- in the routine of a -- of a -- of handling the client. Those are expenses --
05-18 +++$+++ 38887 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you're saying the word expenses should refer only to expenses incurred by counsel, which of course would be normally reimbursable.
05-18 +++$+++ 38888 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-18 +++$+++ 38889 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but I'm not -- I'm not sure that you don't have a further answer to Justice Stevens because there's (3)(A) and (3)(B). (3)(A) talks about costs and expenses awarded to the prevailing party. (3)(B) says, for the same sample the number of hours spent.
05-18 +++$+++ 38890 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They're talking about -- the same sample refers to a -- a designated number of States, a representative number of States. So the sample refers to the States surveyed, not to those --
05-18 +++$+++ 38891 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's certainly possible. I just wonder why don't we look and see what they intended, since they told us. In the conference report, they say the conferees intend the phrase, attorneys' fees as part of costs, to include reasonable expenses and fees of expert witnesses and the reasonable cost of any test or evaluation which is found to be necessary for the preparation of a parent or guardian's case in the action or proceeding. So why are we metaphysically trying to guess what Congress intended when they told us what they intended?
05-18 +++$+++ 38892 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't think it's so much a question of metaphysics or philosophy -- maybe perhaps of philosophy.
05-18 +++$+++ 38893 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ My question is why don't we just look and see what they intended since they wrote it down on a piece of paper and all we have to do is read it?
05-18 +++$+++ 38894 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Did Congress say that, Mr. Kuntz?
05-18 +++$+++ 38895 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Congress didn't say that.
05-18 +++$+++ 38896 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought it did. I thought that the conferees in Congress wrote in the conference report precisely what they intended.
05-18 +++$+++ 38897 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, if I might respond to that.
05-18 +++$+++ 38898 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, I'd like you to respond to it. (Laughter.)
05-18 +++$+++ 38899 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's -- it's a longstanding rule of statutory construction that Congress' intent is best found in the language that Congress actually puts into the statute. And as we pointed out in the brief, there were previous versions of this act which included experts' fees which did not make its way to the final version approved by both the -- the Senate and the House.
05-18 +++$+++ 38900 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's no doubt that the best evidence is the text of the statute, but at least the people who drafted this, even if they were not the conferees themselves but were just staff members, they apparently thought the language was subject to that reading.
05-18 +++$+++ 38901 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor --
05-18 +++$+++ 38902 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which would mean it would be ambiguous, wouldn't it?
05-18 +++$+++ 38903 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The rule that we look first to the -- yes, Your Honor. Yes.
05-18 +++$+++ 38904 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The rule that you refer to that you cannot look at legislative history -- of course, we always start with the plain language. That's clear. But the rule that you cannot look at legislative history didn't really get any emphasis till after 1987, and this statute was enacted in 1986.
05-18 +++$+++ 38905 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that -- in -- in the retrospective view that the Court looked at in -- in the -- the Casey decision, it went back and it traced the origin of a number of -- of statutes and looked essentially to similar language, and it found that experts' fees were not a part of attorneys' fees, and it found that experts' fees were not a part of -- of costs.
05-18 +++$+++ 38906 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But it also found that there were dozens of statutes, I think -- didn't Justice Scalia list in his opinion for -- it went on for a couple of pages, including footnotes? I think it was over 30 that did mention experts. It mentioned attorneys' fees and expert fees.
05-18 +++$+++ 38907 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, and to us that proves that Congress knows how to distinguish between experts' fees and attorneys' fees when it wants to.
05-18 +++$+++ 38908 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was this language, by the way -- I'm not clear. It always cited to the House -- the House conferees. Was -- was this language in the -- in the Senate conference report?
05-18 +++$+++ 38909 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, I don't believe it was.
05-18 +++$+++ 38910 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So we don't really know --
05-18 +++$+++ 38911 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It emanates -- it emanates solely from the House conference report.
05-18 +++$+++ 38912 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's only half of the Congress, isn't it? Even if --
05-18 +++$+++ 38913 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought it was a joint explanatory statement.
05-18 +++$+++ 38914 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- even if everybody in the House agreed with that, which we don't really know. What about the President? When he signed it, did -- did he indicate any interpretation?
05-18 +++$+++ 38915 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ His -- Your Honor, the -- the President's hesitancy was about the retroactive effect of the statute, and he noted that in his signing memorandum, but he didn't note any other differences.
05-18 +++$+++ 38916 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So we have a committee of one house that said -- that said that, that thought it meant that or would have liked it to mean that.
05-18 +++$+++ 38917 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. And it isn't all that unusual that the congressional history of a particular statute might point one way and the actual plain meaning point another way.
05-18 +++$+++ 38918 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do you explain the title, Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of the Conference? Doesn't that speak for both the House and the Senate?
05-18 +++$+++ 38919 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- yes, Your Honor, it does.
05-18 +++$+++ 38920 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So it's not correct it's just for one house. It's -- what I have is the Joint Explanatory Committee, and it says the managers, on the part of the House and the Senate.
05-18 +++$+++ 38921 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It -- it does say that, Your Honor.
05-18 +++$+++ 38922 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. And is there some rule -- I don't know what this rule is you can't refer to legislative history. Does it say that in the Constitution of the United States?
05-18 +++$+++ 38923 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor, it doesn't.
05-18 +++$+++ 38924 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. And so --
05-18 +++$+++ 38925 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Counsel, sometimes these joint statements are actually voted on by the Congress as a whole. Was this one -- was this one voted on?
05-18 +++$+++ 38926 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There was no evidence of that, Your Honor, in our review.
05-18 +++$+++ 38927 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which ones are voted on? I've not heard of that. I mean, they might be, but it used to be that the -- they circulate the report to all the Members and the Members read it, and if a Member disagrees with it, they note their dissent. Maybe it's changed. But I guess --
05-18 +++$+++ 38928 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can you cite an example of a conference report that was voted on by the Congress?
05-18 +++$+++ 38929 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I cannot, Your Honor, and that's why I -- I responded as I did, which is that I know of no evidence.
05-18 +++$+++ 38930 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think we have said that conference reports are more valuable than the reports of a single house. I think we have said that.
05-18 +++$+++ 38931 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They are voted on when the -- when the conferees make changes, which they sometimes do. Then -- then, of course, they have to be voted on. So it's frequent. It's frequent that they're voted on, but this one apparently -- there were no changes made and it wasn't voted on.
05-18 +++$+++ 38932 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Your Honor. If I -- if there are no further questions, I'd like --
05-18 +++$+++ 38933 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Breyer knows that. He -- he's worked there.
05-18 +++$+++ 38934 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, I'm sorry.
05-18 +++$+++ 38935 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I didn't have an opportunity to work for a Senator who, in fact, to my experience asked me to report on a vote on such a thing. I just wasn't aware of it.
05-18 +++$+++ 38936 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel.
05-18 +++$+++ 38937 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you. I'd like to reserve my time for rebuttal.
05-18 +++$+++ 38938 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Certainly.
05-18 +++$+++ 38939 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you.
05-18 +++$+++ 38940 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Salmons.
05-18 +++$+++ 38942 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You have examples of conference reports being voted on, don't you?
05-18 +++$+++ 38943 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I do not, Your Honor. I -- I do not dispute the representations that have been made about that practice. But let me begin by saying, thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: This Court should give the attorneys' fee provision of IDEA the same construction it gave the nearly identical language of section 1988 in Casey and hold that an award of attorneys' fees as part of the cost does not include expert fees. Respondent's sole argument is that expert fees are included in the statutory term costs, but as this Court made clear in both Casey and Crawford Fitting, the term costs in a fee-shifting statute has a well-settled meaning and is a reference and is limited to those -- that modest category of costs that may be awarded under 28 U.S.C. 1920 and 1821. Now --
05-18 +++$+++ 38944 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- what do you say about expenses? Isn't -- isn't it a fairly common practice for a -- a trial lawyer to -- to hire his experts and pay them and then bill the client for -- for whatever he's paid for the experts? I mean, if that is the -- this has been a long time since I've practiced law. So maybe that isn't the way it's done anymore. But it -- it certainly has been done that way, and -- and if that is still the practice, wouldn't it make sense for Congress to have assumed that expenses would include those kinds of expenses?
05-18 +++$+++ 38945 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. No, I don't think so, Your Honor. Now, first of all, just to be clear, the -- the fee provision that's at issue here is identical to the fee provision that was at issue in Casey, and it makes no reference to expenses. It says attorneys' fees as part of the costs. Now, in this separate section instructing the GAO to do a report --
05-18 +++$+++ 38946 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's the GAO reference. You're right.
05-18 +++$+++ 38947 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- it says to look at the -- the awards in cases, the awards of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses. We don't think the term expenses in -- in that provision can fairly be read to somehow dramatically expand the meaning of the phrase, attorneys' fees as part of the costs. We think it's much more naturally to read that as just a reference, as this Court noted in Casey, to the common practice of including out-of-pocket expenses of attorneys for things like copying costs and -- and necessary travel expenses and things like that as -- as also being compensable. And so we don't think that that -- that term expenses does anything dramatically to the meaning of the statutory provision at issue here. And as far as subsection (B) of that provision related to the GAO, we think it's clear that it's no longer referring to the actual awards in cases, and is instructing the GAO to do a broader study about the time that's spent by attorneys and consultants and others on both sides in these cases because Congress was very concerned about the amount of litigation and the expense of that litigation and the diversion of funds away from the core educational services of the schools. As this Court noted in Schaffer, that's one of the primary concerns Congress has had, especially in the more recent amendments to the act. And we think, in fact, that the -- the fact that Congress instructed the GAO to study that is, if anything, more consistent with the idea that Congress decided not to legislate on the question of expert fees, but to leave it for another day after they've had the benefit of that study at a minimum. Now --
05-18 +++$+++ 38948 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Salmons, there's one difference, a marked difference, between this statute and the others, and that is, in -- in many of these cases, it is the consultant that is the primary, perhaps exclusive, aide to the parent. There's not a case where they have these determinations, a lawyer is in the front line. Even in this very case, wasn't it true that it was the consultant who was the aide to the parent and there was no lawyer on the scene?
05-18 +++$+++ 38949 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that is correct. During the administrative proceeding and in the -- and in the district court, there was no attorney here. But -- but I think there's one important thing to keep in mind about that is that that's -- Congress expected that that would be the result. This is not a statute where Congress didn't think about the role of experts. Among other things, section --
05-18 +++$+++ 38950 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What do you -- what do you say about the legislative history, which has been so prominent in the discussion this morning? The conference report.
05-18 +++$+++ 38951 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. Well, I think the conference report clearly represents the view of the author of the conference report with regard to the meaning of the language.
05-18 +++$+++ 38952 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, don't you suppose it represents the view of the House and Senate conferees?
05-18 +++$+++ 38953 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I mean, I think -- I think what that points to is the perils of -- of using committee reports and statements --
05-18 +++$+++ 38954 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. I -- I realize that, but I mean, an --
05-18 +++$+++ 38955 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- from the legislative history when the text is clear.
05-18 +++$+++ 38956 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- an argument, a perfectly fair argument, can be made, whether -- whether you find it dispositive or not, that everything that goes into a committee report of one house cannot simply be taken as a literal reflection of the thinking -- the -- the actual thinking of -- of everybody on that committee, let alone a whole house. But when we're talking about a conference report that has been hammered out between two sets of conferees, I think it is reasonable to suppose that the conferees know exactly what is in that report and would take exception to it if it didn't represent their views. Isn't -- isn't that a -- a fair reason for saying that whatever you may think of reports in general, the conference report probably has a -- a superior authority?
05-18 +++$+++ 38957 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think so, Your Honor, and let me try to explain why. First of all, this Court made clear in Casey, dealing with the exact same language, it took -- you know, that's at issue here --
05-18 +++$+++ 38958 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The text or --
05-18 +++$+++ 38959 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Language in the statute but not in the conference report.
05-18 +++$+++ 38960 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-18 +++$+++ 38961 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was there a conference report in --
05-18 +++$+++ 38962 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. That's right. And I'm referring to the statutory language here, that this Court considered this exact --
05-18 +++$+++ 38963 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And would you agree, if the statute is ambiguous, you can look at the conference report?
05-18 +++$+++ 38964 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but my point, Your Honor, is that what this Court said --
05-18 +++$+++ 38965 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Would you answer my question?
05-18 +++$+++ 38966 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes. If the Court thinks the statute is ambiguous, it's fair to look at the conference report.
05-18 +++$+++ 38967 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And why is it not ambiguous if the author of the conference report read it that way?
05-18 +++$+++ 38968 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ For, among other reasons, Your Honor -- this is what I was trying to -- trying to state because this Court in Casey, dealing with this exact same language, said the following. It said where the statute contains a phrase that is unambiguous, attorneys' fees as part of the cost, that has a clearly accepted meaning in both legislative and judicial practices -- again, this Court in Casey tracked through the -- the usage, the history of the usage of this language and the way courts had responded to this over time -- that when that's the case, we do not permit it to be expanded or contracted by the statements of individual legislators or committees during the course of the enactment process. We think that holding in Casey is equally applicable here --
05-18 +++$+++ 38969 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, one thing here --
05-18 +++$+++ 38970 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- and it be would wrong to look to that. Now, if the Court did, I think the thing that the Court should take away from it, if you're going to look at what Congress intended here -- and this is undisputably true. Everyone agrees on this. The primary purpose of this legislation was to respond to this Court's decision in Smith v. Robinson. And prior to this Court's decision in Smith, section 1988 had provided the means by which courts had awarded attorneys' fees in cases under IDEA's predecessor.
05-18 +++$+++ 38971 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does the gravamen --
05-18 +++$+++ 38972 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Smith foreclosed those fees --
05-18 +++$+++ 38973 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- does the gravamen -- well, I'll let you finish your answer.
05-18 +++$+++ 38974 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure.
05-18 +++$+++ 38975 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does the gravamen of the argument -- is it that this phrase is unambiguous?
05-18 +++$+++ 38976 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that is certainly our first argument, absolutely, Your Honor. The point I'm making now is that if you look at the context in which this language was used, Smith foreclosed the award of section 1988 fees. Congress responded shortly thereafter by -- by adding the precise language of section 1988 to the language in IDEA's predecessor. Now, however anomalous it would normally be to give the same language in two different fee provisions different meanings -- and it would be quite anomalous -- to do so here with section --
05-18 +++$+++ 38977 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But isn't it true that at the time they did that, it was well settled in cases of this kind that the Court would look at the conference report to ascertain the meaning of the statute? At that time, in 1986.
05-18 +++$+++ 38978 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think --
05-18 +++$+++ 38979 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Was there any case that said you can't look at the conference report at that time?
05-18 +++$+++ 38980 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There are plenty of cases, Your Honor, that -- that point out --
05-18 +++$+++ 38981 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- later.
05-18 +++$+++ 38982 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that the -- that -- that point out, even -- even I think beforehand, that the language is the primary basis to look.
05-18 +++$+++ 38983 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is the best evidence, but not the sole evidence.
05-18 +++$+++ 38984 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that even when it's unambiguous, that's the end of the matter.
05-18 +++$+++ 38985 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Counsel, even in -- in those benighted days, I don't think -- I don't think we ever would use the conference report when the statute was not ambiguous. I thought it was always a rule that -- that --
05-18 +++$+++ 38986 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We certainly agree with that, and I would just add that I'm not aware of any decision of this Court that would suggest that the type of statutory construction tools the Court would use would depend on what was in place at the time that the statute was enacted.
05-18 +++$+++ 38987 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. Of course --
05-18 +++$+++ 38988 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, this Court applies the rules that it thinks are appropriate at the time it issues its decision. Now --
05-18 +++$+++ 38989 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You can't use red if the statute says green. Green doesn't include red. I understand that. And that's why, in fact, I wondered if the presence in this bill of the GAO section suggests in the bill itself the possibility that the word cost means something special. And if that's so, then I would think it is ambiguous enough to refer to the legislative history. It's not like using the word red and arguing it includes green.
05-18 +++$+++ 38990 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SALMONS +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Two responses to that, Your Honor. The first is that we don't think it's ambiguous at all, and we think when -- even if you look at the GAO provision, you don't get the kind of ambiguity that would allow you to otherwise deviate from the -- the clear meaning of this language when it's -- when it's been consistent with statutory usage over time. As this Court noted in Casey, more than 34 statutes use -- expressly state attorneys' fees in addition to expert -- expert fees in addition to attorneys' fees, and there would be no point to those. But -- but moreover, I think the important thing to keep in mind is that it's not just this fee provision. If you want a further indication of Congress' intent, let me refer you to some other provisions of the statute itself, again, the language of the statute. Among other things, section 1415(d)(2) expressly details the content of the notice that has to be given to the parents about the procedural safeguards in the act, and it's very specific. It lists 13 different things that States have to explain in full to the parents. The -- the 12th and the 13th items on that list are the parents' ability to bring a civil action and their right to bring, quote, attorneys' fees, no mention whatsoever of expert fees. Thank you, Your Honors.
05-18 +++$+++ 38991 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Salmons. Mr. Vladeck.
05-18 +++$+++ 38993 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Murphys' principal submission in this case is that the text of IDEA authorizes courts to award prevailing parents the costs of the experts who assist them in IDEA hearings which are typically held before State administrative tribunals and in Federal court.
05-18 +++$+++ 38994 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Vladeck, let me just give you a purely hypothetical situation. Let's suppose that the conferees can't agree whether expert fees should be included. Some think they should; some think they shouldn't. And somebody suggests a compromise. The compromise is we won't put it in the statute, but we'll put it in the report and we'll let the courts figure it out. What should happen in that situation?
05-18 +++$+++ 38995 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you so much, Your Honor. I think -- I think that if the statutory text was clear, which -- and I believe this text is clear in the other direction -- I think we would lose that case. But that is not this case, Your Honor, and let me explain why.
05-18 +++$+++ 38996 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well if that's not this case, what in the world prevented the conferees from putting something as important in this context as expert fees, as I understand it, probably more important than attorneys' fees -- what prevented them from putting that in the statute if that clearly was their intent?
05-18 +++$+++ 38997 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Without being flippant, Your Honor, I think that the conferees thought they had put it in the statute. Remember, this statute was passed back in 1986 when, at least with respect to the 99th Congress that enacted this provision, the word cost did not have the term-of-art meaning that was later ascribed to it in this Court's opinion in Casey.
05-18 +++$+++ 38998 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As you --
05-18 +++$+++ 38999 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I was going to say it certainly had the meaning in Federal -- the Federal court context set forth in section 1920 of the Judicial Code.
05-18 +++$+++ 39000 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I understand that, Your Honor, but Congress thought it was adding -- that the use of the word cost and its breadth was a way of -- of including the cost. And -- and this is important, Your Honor. The language --
05-18 +++$+++ 39001 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Before you get past Casey, Casey didn't invent this as a definition. Casey said it has always meant this in innumerable Federal statutes. Casey was relying on a longstanding practice which existed long before Casey was -- was pronounced.
05-18 +++$+++ 39002 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, at the time Casey was -- at the time this case was -- excuse me -- at the time this statute was enacted by Congress, for example, costs were routinely read to include expert fees in title VII cases, for example. So I don't disagree with Your Honor's point. I am simply saying that the lens through which this statute must be judged is the understanding of the 99th Congress, and every indication in the legislative history here is that Congress used the word cost for its breadth, not as a term of art.
05-18 +++$+++ 39003 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Vladeck, why -- if that was what Congress had in mind, then how do you explain the multiple statutes that are listed in Casey that say, in the text of the statute, witness fees?
05-18 +++$+++ 39004 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My only explanation, Your Honor, is that the -- the Members of Congress who wrote this provision were unaware of the difference this Court would later ascribe to those statutes in Casey.
05-18 +++$+++ 39005 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not later ascribe. I mean, Casey was relying on --
05-18 +++$+++ 39006 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Casey -- Casey is very clear in saying the judicial background against which Congress enacted 1988, talking about 1988, mirror the statutory background, and it says the judicial background was that expert fees were quite different than attorneys' fees. They were not a subset of attorneys' fees.
05-18 +++$+++ 39007 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Even -- even conceding all of that, which I -- I think is -- let me take a step back. Even if you reject that submission, the next provision of the statute on which we rely is section 4 of the Handicapped Children's Protection Act, which was enacted at the same time as section 1415(i)(3)(B), and if you look at that provision, it is clear that Congress intended the word cost to have a broader meaning. Section 4(b)(A) directs the General Accounting Office to study --
05-18 +++$+++ 39008 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Where is that set forth?
05-18 +++$+++ 39009 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry? That's page -- excuse me. Page 4 of the red brief, Your Honor.
05-18 +++$+++ 39010 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you.
05-18 +++$+++ 39011 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That directs the General Accounting Office, first, to study the amount of attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses awarded to the prevailing party. In this statute, only the parents could be the awarding -- the prevailing party because, unlike 1988, this statute is a one-way street and provides only for awards to parents. And secondly, it says that for -- for the --
05-18 +++$+++ 39012 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what -- Mr. Vladeck, may I stop you there? Because the parents are always the plaintiff. It's not the child. The parents are representing the child.
05-18 +++$+++ 39013 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor.
05-18 +++$+++ 39014 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So prevailing party is identical to parents. The parents are the ones who prevail.
05-18 +++$+++ 39015 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's exactly my point, Your Honor. And -- and --
05-18 +++$+++ 39016 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but the word consultants appears in subsection (B) of the statute.
05-18 +++$+++ 39017 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, Your Honor.
05-18 +++$+++ 39018 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that specifically refers to the State educational agency and local educational agency.
05-18 +++$+++ 39019 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor --
05-18 +++$+++ 39020 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it uses personnel, which sounds to me a very odd way to talk about private experts hired by an attorney. You don't talk about them as personnel.
05-18 +++$+++ 39021 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, this provision, up until the last part which says, and expenses incurred by the parents, the -- the last clause of this provision was added in the conference. And the conference report makes that clear at page 7. The conference report makes it clear that the House -- the Senate recedes to the House bill. The GAO study provision was only in the House bill, with an amendment expanding the data collection requirements of the GAO study to include information recording the amount of funds expended by local educational agencies and State education agencies on civil actions and administrative proceedings. That clause was added, Your Honor, in conference. Prior to the conference, the provision was very much the same as it is today. So --
05-18 +++$+++ 39022 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Vladeck, my -- my problem with the argument you're now making is -- is a little more basic. Assuming, which I think is a -- is a major assumption, that expenses refers to expert fees, I don't see how it helps your case that in another part of the statute, the statute says, fees, costs, and expenses, whereas in the operative part that we're talking about here, it only refers to fees as part of costs. How does it help your case that --
05-18 +++$+++ 39023 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor --
05-18 +++$+++ 39024 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that elsewhere they go out of their way to add and -- and expenses? It seems to me that hurts your case.
05-18 +++$+++ 39025 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't believe that this is an inoperative part of the statute. I believe that -- that -- this direction to GAO makes no sense if all Congress sought to authorize was attorneys' fees and the costs that are historically available under section 1920 and section 1821. This provision makes no sense.
05-18 +++$+++ 39026 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't -- isn't it really the point not that it makes no sense, but that it raises a question? It creates the question, which -- which we have in mind when we say the statute is ambiguous, and it is in answering that question, that you then turn to the legislative history, which has a pretty unequivocal statement in your favor. Isn't -- isn't that the -- the way to analyze it?
05-18 +++$+++ 39027 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- it certainly can be read that way. I read it as more of an affirmative statement by Congress --
05-18 +++$+++ 39028 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but if you conclude that the statute is ambiguous, what do you do with the Spending Clause problem? We've said that when you're imposing conditions in Spending Clause legislation, you have to do that unambiguously. It's what the Court said in -- in Pennhurst.
05-18 +++$+++ 39029 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
05-18 +++$+++ 39030 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If it's ambiguous, if the availability of expert fees, which is the big-ticket item in these things, not the attorneys' fees, States are not unambiguously on notice that they're accepting that liability when they take the funds.
05-18 +++$+++ 39031 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With all respect, let me quarrel with one of the premises in your question, which is that the -- the expenses for experts are, quote, a big-ticket item. If you look at page 28, footnote 17 of our brief, we've tried to compile all of the reported cases on the amount of expert fees that are awarded. They tend to be exceedingly modest, Your Honor. They run from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars.
05-18 +++$+++ 39032 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's before the Magna Carta you're asking for in this case which would establish a whole -- a whole --
05-18 +++$+++ 39033 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor --
05-18 +++$+++ 39034 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- new profession of experts.
05-18 +++$+++ 39035 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, that is not the case. The -- the rule that we seek to preserve has been the way courts have interpreted this provision since 1988. That's --
05-18 +++$+++ 39036 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, even if it is not the big-ticket item --
05-18 +++$+++ 39037 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So -- so these are modest.
05-18 +++$+++ 39038 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- it still has to be -- it still has to be unambiguously set forth in Spending Clause legislation.
05-18 +++$+++ 39039 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. And -- and if the Court finds that the legislative history adds the clarity that the statute otherwise needed -- is needed, I do not see why that would not comply with the Spending Clause, particularly since, Your Honor, this statute has been on the book for 20 years. There are dozens of opinions finding that expert fees are compensable. No Spending Clause argument has ever been raised in this kind of issue even though the statute has been on the books for 20 years.
05-18 +++$+++ 39040 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Under your reading of 1415, may a court award to parents any costs that they incur in connection with the litigation, or -- or would you just add expert fees to the attorneys' fees?
05-18 +++$+++ 39041 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, there is a body of law on that issue that already exists because courts have interpreted this provision since 1986. By and large, the costs that have been awarded under the statute are costs that are normally associated with litigation, copying costs, computer-assisted research when there's a lawyer involved.
05-18 +++$+++ 39042 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What about testing? Isn't testing --
05-18 +++$+++ 39043 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The cost of testing and evaluation, which is -- which is a crucial component of the statute -- those costs have been awarded.
05-18 +++$+++ 39044 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if costs is not a term -- is not a legal term of art, if it really -- if it means just the expenses that parents incur, why wouldn't it include things like travel expenses or lost wages to attend the court proceeding?
05-18 +++$+++ 39045 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the way the courts have addressed that issue, Your Honor, is they -- they have looked to the -- the initial phrase of the statute, in an action or a proceeding, and have found those costs not sufficiently closely enough related to the action or proceeding to justify an award. And also courts have applied the rule 54 reasonableness standard in ordering costs under this provision, and therefore, expert costs have been reduced and other costs have been reduced to meet the general requirements of rule 54. I would like -- I would like to --
05-18 +++$+++ 39046 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would you read the phrase from the conference report as a limitation? That is, that -- we're trying to figure out what the Congress meant by the phrase costs. It says it means includes reasonable expense and fees of expert witnesses and reasonable costs of any test or evaluation that's necessary. So then is that -- have the courts read that as a -- as a limitation?
05-18 +++$+++ 39047 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, but they've also imposed limitations that are generally -- that generally constrain the awards of costs in cases. They have not done what -- what I understood Justice Alito -- his question to -- to get to, was to use this as -- as a broad, open door. I'd like to talk about the legislative history, and particularly I'd like to respond to Justice Scalia's comment about the conference report in this case. This statute was changed dramatically in conference. It does not reflect either the House bill or the Senate bill. If one reads the conference report in the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee of the Conference, which is three pages long, one will see that there were dramatic and substantial changes made because there were substantial disagreements between the House and the Senate, not on the question of reimbursement of expert costs. That -- that provision -- that understanding was shared on a bipartisan basis in both houses. But the --
05-18 +++$+++ 39048 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why were the earlier versions that included that expressly then not -- why didn't they make it through to the final version?
05-18 +++$+++ 39049 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the version that -- that was referred to earlier, Your Honor, came out of the Senate bill. The Senate bill contained a number of very controversial features. It was pared down, and the word cost was substituted, as the drafter of the language made clear on the floor of the Senate before the Senate voted on its version of the bill, and Senator Weicker's explanation of what the word cost means could not be clearer, and he -- he --
05-18 +++$+++ 39050 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, we've slid back from the joint statement to the statement of one Member on the floor now.
05-18 +++$+++ 39051 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I'm happy for you to rely on the joint statement, Your Honor. My only point is, is that the understanding in the House report is expert fees were included in the House bill, which referred to costs and expenses. Senator Weicker explains precisely the question you asked, which is what happened to the Senate bill. And Senator Weicker's explanation, which was made before the Senate, immediately before the Senate voted on the bill, makes clear that expert costs are included. Then, of course, you have the bill going to conference. There were many changes in the bill, including the language of section 1415. Prior to the conference, it did not say attorneys' fees as part of costs. It said attorneys' fees in addition to costs. That language was changed in conference to accommodate this Court's decision in Marek v. Chesny, which had to do with the applicability of rule 68.
05-18 +++$+++ 39052 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, speaking of that -- of that language, that attorneys' fees may be awarded as part of costs, does that suggest -- it doesn't say directly that costs may be awarded. Does that suggest that the attorneys' fees are simply to be regarded as another element of costs that -- that may be awarded under the costs statute?
05-18 +++$+++ 39053 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't believe that Congress, when it used the word costs, was adverting to section 1920. If that is your question, I do not believe that that is --
05-18 +++$+++ 39054 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, then where is the authorization? I think that's what Justice Alito's question goes to. You have to come up with some statutory authorization to pay expert fees. Now, attorneys' fees as part of costs does not authorize any costs. It just says whatever costs are otherwise authorized, attorneys' fees will be part of that.
05-18 +++$+++ 39055 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, it says -- it's part of the cost to the parents. And unlike section 1980, this language is not, contrary to the previous submissions to the Court, identical to the language in 1988. It says that a court may award attorneys' fees as part of the costs to parents, and the --
05-18 +++$+++ 39056 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What is the authorization to pay costs, to pay those costs that include expert fees? All -- all this section says is they may award attorneys' fees as part of costs, and costs are presumably elsewhere authorized.
05-18 +++$+++ 39057 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor --
05-18 +++$+++ 39058 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But where is the authorization to pay?
05-18 +++$+++ 39059 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Under -- under that reading, no statute would authorize the -- the payment of costs.
05-18 +++$+++ 39060 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Under that reading, wouldn't -- wouldn't you have a problem in a State court? Because doesn't this same provision govern in a State court, so that if the State did not have a separate cost statute, it would -- it would authorize nothing. Isn't -- isn't that the problem you'd run into.
05-18 +++$+++ 39061 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is correct. Let me make one last --
05-18 +++$+++ 39062 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Do you know any State that doesn't have a cost statute?
05-18 +++$+++ 39063 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I have not -- I've not looked at them to see whether they correspond to 1920, Your Honor.
05-18 +++$+++ 39064 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Vladeck, you have -- you referred to the section on GAO reporting --
05-18 +++$+++ 39065 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-18 +++$+++ 39066 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- as an assist to help you include consultant fees in -- in costs. But how do you explain the -- the provision in this very statute that says attorneys' fees can be reduced? Congress explicitly provided that you could reduce attorneys' fees -- this is in 1415(i)(3)(F) -- and not one word about reducing the costs of testing fees or consulting fees.
05-18 +++$+++ 39067 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, all costs are subject to the general requirement in rule 54 of reasonableness, and --
05-18 +++$+++ 39068 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Then why -- then it would be unnecessary to have done that for attorneys' fees.
05-18 +++$+++ 39069 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Here's the reason, Your Honor. At least, here's the reason that -- as I understand it. Much of the litigation in IDEA cases takes out -- takes place outside the confines of Federal court. Most of the litigation takes place in State due process hearings. And what I believe Congress was interested in making sure were the general rules, like rule 11, the general rules that punish parties for engaging in vexatious or frivolous litigation would have some analog in these proceedings. And therefore, what the court -- what -- what Congress did was to authorize a Federal court, in reviewing an application for attorneys' fees incurred before a State-administered tribunal, because that's where the action takes place in these cases, to -- to be able to reduce an attorneys' fee award if there was misconduct by the parent or -- or the lawyer, misconduct in the sense of trying to protract litigation or multiply proceedings. And interestingly, Your Honor, the -- the conference report addresses this issue and does explain -- and now I'm quoting from page 6 of the -- of the conference report, the joint explanation -- that the court shall accordingly reduce the amount of attorneys' fees and related expenses otherwise allowable if they determine that this misconduct had taken place. So I think that at least in the conference report, Congress is signaling that if there were other costs that were incurred unreasonably as a result of lawyers protracting or delaying the proceeding, they too would be subject to the same reduction.
05-18 +++$+++ 39070 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's effective too, as though it were written into the statute, because one committee of Congress said so. That's effective.
05-18 +++$+++ 39071 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, this is not one committee of Congress. This was -- this -- the conference report was circulated to all Members of Congress before they voted on the final bill.
05-18 +++$+++ 39072 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and they read it.
05-18 +++$+++ 39073 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, this is the final bill they voted on, and if they turned the page --
05-18 +++$+++ 39074 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's the only thing we know for sure that they voted on.
05-18 +++$+++ 39075 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is correct, Your Honor, though the vote technically, of course, is a vote to approve the conference report. That is the final vote Congress took on this legislation. The vote was a vote to approve the conference report, which contains four pages -- three pages of text and three pages of explanation.
05-18 +++$+++ 39076 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Did the -- did the final bill say we adopt the findings of the conference report?
05-18 +++$+++ 39077 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It did not, Your Honor.
05-18 +++$+++ 39078 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And other bills have said that.
05-18 +++$+++ 39079 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I --
05-18 +++$+++ 39080 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Like in -- as in Nofstiker.
05-18 +++$+++ 39081 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ As far as I know, Your Honor, the procedure followed here was the standard procedure when the conference report takes bills and essentially amalgamates them or redrafts them --
05-18 +++$+++ 39082 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But was this legislation vetoed by the President?
05-18 +++$+++ 39083 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It was not, Your Honor.
05-18 +++$+++ 39084 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, when the President signed it, did -- did he also approve the conference report? Did he have the conference report in front of him?
05-18 +++$+++ 39085 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I do not know that.
05-18 +++$+++ 39086 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ He had the statute in front of him, didn't he?
05-18 +++$+++ 39087 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- he -- my assumption, Your Honor, is he had this.
05-18 +++$+++ 39088 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You -- you think he read the conference report too.
05-18 +++$+++ 39089 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't believe that. (Laughter.)
05-18 +++$+++ 39090 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not arguing that he did. My assumption, though, is if he had the statute before him, he probably had this. The President --
05-18 +++$+++ 39091 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Was there any opposition? Was there any -- is there any history of anyone in this Senate or the House either before or after suggesting that they didn't want to allow recovery for the expert fees?
05-18 +++$+++ 39092 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Not at all, Your Honor. And one of the points that I would like to make -- and I would like to return to the language of 1415 -- is this statute is all -- the IDEA is a statute all about protecting parents and children with disabilities. One provision of IDEA we have not mentioned, but I think is an important one, is the general guarantee that --
05-18 +++$+++ 39093 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Counsel, if I could interrupt you. As I understood it, this gets back to where you started. Your position is that if this same scenario had taken place in 1988 as opposed to 1986, that your position would not be the same. In other words, you said -- your suggestion was that it was the legal context at the time in '86 that governed what Congress thought the effectiveness of its statements in committee reports would be. Maybe I'm ascribing one of the Justice's views to you.
05-18 +++$+++ 39094 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- if you're -- and -- and forgive my -- my lack of knowledge of the exact history of this, but if 1988 is a date upon which the Court begins to be reluctant to look at legislative history, I would concede that my case would be different post- 1988. It is quite clear that the Congress that enacted this bill assumed, and rightly so, that this Court and reviewing courts would rely on legislative history. Indeed, when this Court issued its opinion in Casey, footnote 5 of Casey says that this case may be different because of the conference report.
05-18 +++$+++ 39095 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What -- what date in -- I mean, so we have two different modes of interpreting statutes: one, pre-1988 in which we use legislative history, and one post-1988 in which we don't use legislative history?
05-18 +++$+++ 39096 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor --
05-18 +++$+++ 39097 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, that -- that's what you're suggesting, isn't it?
05-18 +++$+++ 39098 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What I am suggesting is that the Court's role, as I understand it, is to be the faithful agent of Congress, and if the -- if the expectation of Members of Congress is that language in committee reports will -- will garner respect from the Court, it is hard to then change the rules on Congress. The operative question here is what --
05-18 +++$+++ 39099 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The reason one does not use legislative history, if one does not use it, as I don't -- as I don't, is not because Congress doesn't expect it to be used, but because Congress does not have the power to delegate to one of its committees the content of -- of its statutes. The Constitution provides that legislation will be passed by two houses and signed by the President, and the problem with legislative history, for those of us who have a problem with it, is this amounts to a delegation by Congress. It's not a matter of what Congress expected. I don't care what Congress expected. It can't do it. It can't leave it to a -- to a committee to -- to fill in the blanks in a statute. That's the problem, and that has nothing to do with expectations.
05-18 +++$+++ 39100 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, my only point is that the Congress that enacted this statute, the 99th Congress, thought -- and this -- this view is expressed repeatedly in the legislative history, and I believe it -- it is reflected in the statutory language as well -- that the word costs here would be given a broad meaning to ensure that parents were made whole when they have to fight against school boards to secure that which IDEA guarantees their child, which is a free and appropriate public education. This Court has repeatedly in Township of Burlington, in Tatrow, in Florence County said that provisions of IDEA should not be interpreted in ways that detract from this fundamental guarantee. There would be no more clear detraction from that guarantee than requiring parents to bear the expense, which for many of these parents is enormous, even though Chief Justice, it may amount to only a few hundred or a few thousand dollars, to retain an expert, to do battle with school boards who have experts on staff. Earlier this term, this Court decided Schaffer v. Weast. Post Schaffer, parents cannot hope to meet their burden of production, let alone their burden of proof in IDEA hearings without expert assistance. To force parents to bear those expenses, even when they prevail, will detract from IDEA's core guarantee that the -- that the education provided to the child is both appropriate and free. Those provisions are in the statute to avoid having parents being compelled to make the Hobson's choice: a free education that's inappropriate or an appropriate education that is not free. This Court repeatedly instructs lower courts to interpret statutes consistent with the statutory context. I would urge that in looking at section 1415, you take a look at -- at -- there are now eight sections of the statute that reinforce this guarantee. It is hard to imagine a statutory guarantee more deeply embedded in an act than the guarantee of a free and appropriate public education than is embedded in the IDEA. Permitting parents to recover their expert costs --
05-18 +++$+++ 39101 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But it's not -- if the parents make a reasonable effort, but they lose, it's not going to be free. I mean, the -- the statute gives them --
05-18 +++$+++ 39102 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but --
05-18 +++$+++ 39103 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- a right to oppose the school board's choice, and if what you say about making it easier on parents of limited resources, they're told it's going to be a gamble if you lose, you don't get your fees.
05-18 +++$+++ 39104 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. VLADECK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor, but they lose only when the school board is providing, in fact, an education that is appropriate. But where the parent prevails because the school board was not providing a free and appropriate education, the act's guarantee would be seriously eroded unless parents can recover the costs of their expert -- of their experts. If there are no further questions, thank you very much.
05-18 +++$+++ 39105 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Kuntz, you have 4 minutes remaining.
05-18 +++$+++ 39107 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Your Honor. Shifting the costs to the school district of experts' fees will also shift scarce public resources away from the point where it's most effective, at the stage when the parent meets with the IEP team to resolve the differences. When Congress has revisited this statute, as it has since 1986, time and time and again, it's -- it's spoken to the -- to the goal of reducing litigation and -- and reducing the costs associated with litigation. If -- if as the Respondents claim, it's central to the fulfillment of this statute that -- that Congress be seen to have shifted the costs of these so-called experts to the -- to the school district when -- when they prevail, I -- I call to the Court's attention that the reality is that the school district has no staff of experts as Respondents intimate. It has no staff of consultants. What it has are the people who actually provide the services to the child, and when they come to testify at the hearing, typically they're -- they're scared or nervous because it's the first time that they've been at such a hearing. They're not professional experts. They're not testimonial experts. Those are the kinds of experts that the Respondents are talking about and asking this Court to see in the statute. One needs to ask the question if Congress really intended expert fees to be a part of this statute, what stayed Congress' hand from writing those words into the statute? It's very clear that Congress knew how to do that when it became appropriate, in its judgment, for it to do that. To sort of see it here lurking in the shadows in -- in sort of the backwaters of -- of the act and to intimate from there that the plain language of the statute has meaning that needs to be expanded and enlightened by the congressional report doesn't make a lot of -- of sense. If -- if it's that important, it should have been there. The -- its absence is very, very telling. And --
05-18 +++$+++ 39108 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Don't the school boards have some consultants and experts in this area other than the teachers?
05-18 +++$+++ 39109 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KUNTZ +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Typically they do not, Your Honor. The typical IEP team meeting has the school psychologist perhaps, has the -- the teachers of the -- of the child. Those -- some of those are required members. It has the parent of a handicapped child. It might have the -- the service providers like the speech pathologist. And when -- when it comes to a trial, comes to a due process hearing, those are the folks who come and testify as to what they know about the child, the test results they have. There are no typical consultants or testimonial experts that appear for the school district. So the -- the central part of this statute, its -- its revolution, where it brings parents of children who are disabled into contact with the -- with the school, has had a wonderful effect in fulfilling the promise of this statute. Energizing the litigation aspect of this by transferring those costs to the school district will -- will take away and will detract from the -- the true meaning of the statute, which was to build a partnership between the parents and the school district, not to let it dribble off into litigation. Thank you.
05-18 +++$+++ 39110 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Kuntz. The case is submitted.
05-184 +++$+++ 39114 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument in number 05-184, Hamdan against Rumsfeld. Mr. Katyal, you may proceed.
05-184 +++$+++ 39116 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: We ask this Court to preserve the status quo to require that the President respect time-honored limitations on military commissions. These limits, placed in articles 21 and 36 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, require no more than that the President try offenses that are, indeed, war crimes and to conduct trials according to the minimal procedural requirements of the UCMJ and the laws of war themselves. These limits do not represent any change in the way military commissions have historically operated. Rather, they reflect Congress's authority under the Define and Punish Clause to codify limits on commissions, limits that this Court has historically enforced to avoid presidential blank checks. And because this commission transgresses those limits, it should be struck down and the district court order reinstated. If I could turn to the jurisdictional matter for a few moments first. We believe that the DTA, while certainly not a model of clarity, does not divest this Court of jurisdiction, for four essential reasons. The first is that, if I could turn to the surreply at page -- the appendix at page 14(a), that contains the initial version of the bill that passed the Senate on November 10th. And at 14(a) it says, on the effective-date provision, "The amendment made by paragraph 1," which is the jurisdiction-stripping provision, "shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of enactment of this act." That language clearly attempted to strip courts of jurisdiction over Guantanamo claims. That language, however, was changed in the final version of the DTA, and the final version of the DTA is found at page 10(a) of the surreply. And that has the following as its effective date. It has two effective-date provisions. The first one I want to start with is H(2), review of combatant status tribunal, CSRT, and military commission decisions, "Paragraphs 2 and 3 of subsection (e) shall apply with respect to any claim whose review is governed by one of such paragraphs and that is pending on or after the date of enactment of the Act." And then, there is a separate provision for the rest of the DTA, for --
05-184 +++$+++ 39117 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Where was that change made from the prior version?
05-184 +++$+++ 39118 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The change was made between November 10th and November 15th.
05-184 +++$+++ 39119 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but, I mean, what -- it was made in what house? Was it made by the conference committee?
05-184 +++$+++ 39120 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was made in the Senate.
05-184 +++$+++ 39121 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was made in the Senate. So the House presumably never saw the prior --
05-184 +++$+++ 39122 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That --
05-184 +++$+++ 39123 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- language.
05-184 +++$+++ 39124 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct.
05-184 +++$+++ 39125 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the President, who signed this bill, never saw the prior language.
05-184 +++$+++ 39126 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct.
05-184 +++$+++ 39127 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So, why should we attribute to both the House and to the President a knowledge of the prior version of the legislation?
05-184 +++$+++ 39128 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, because the language itself was, I think, the subject of an immense amount of debate. And, indeed, when the language was --
05-184 +++$+++ 39129 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In the Senate.
05-184 +++$+++ 39130 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In the Senate. And well-known. And, indeed, you don't have to attribute any knowledge to the President. We have evidence in the record that the administration tried to change the language back to the original formulation. And, indeed, in the House, the chairman of one of the -- the vice chairman of the Conference Report said that the change in the language was in -- was -- the change in the language meant that it grandfathered pending cases such as this one. So, this is not an example of which we have to resort simply to the negative inference of Lindh. However, we do think that is the second reason for you to believe that this case is grandfathered under the existing DTA.
05-184 +++$+++ 39131 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But isn't that --
05-184 +++$+++ 39132 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What, in addition to this case -- I mean, this case is pending in the U.S. Supreme Court. There are many cases pending in the district court when this law comes into effect. What about those cases?
05-184 +++$+++ 39133 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We believe that, as the cosponsor said, on November 15th when they introduce the final version of the language, that all of those cases are grandfathered with respect to the H(1) effective-date provision and the E(1) jurisdiction-stripping provision. However, that still leaves in place the Government's main argument in the D.C. Circuit below, which is that the E(2) provision governing CSRT and final decisions, and the H(2) provision governing final decisions of military -- final decisions of CSRTs, truncates all of the review that is currently in the D.C. Circuit. So, it's certainly plausible -- it's certainly possible, though it's not, of course, presented in this case, to read the DTA as truncating the vast majority of claims at Guantanamo in current pending cases. Of course, that isn't the issue before you here. The issue before you here is simply the Hamdan case, and there was -- and there was a strong -- the strong desire by the Congress not to interfere with this Court's traditionally exercised jurisdiction.
05-184 +++$+++ 39134 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Please go over that again. I'm not -- I'm not sure I understood -- I understood your response.
05-184 +++$+++ 39135 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
05-184 +++$+++ 39136 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You say that it could be read to preclude cases in the lower courts, but not here.
05-184 +++$+++ 39137 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right, cases in which there is a final CSRT decision; that is, that the Government's argument in the D.C. Circuit, Justice Scalia, is that there are two different ways in which the DTA truncated the review of Guantanamo cases. One is the claim that the jurisdiction-stripping provision applies to pending cases. That, we reject. That, we think the Senate rejected on November 15th when it passed the bill. The other is the claim that the E(2) provision governing final decisions of CSRTs, which does, of course, apply to pending cases, as the plain text says, eliminates and truncates a vast -- majority of the detainees' claims. That is the provision --
05-184 +++$+++ 39138 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Does that mean, in practical terms, that the -- that the -- that the other claims that are in the district court get transferred to the circuit, the circuit is bound by the limitations that you've just described, and, at the end of the day, the complaining parties in those cases can raise the question whether they -- whether Congress could properly have truncated them, as it did, but it's simply got to wait?
05-184 +++$+++ 39139 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely. And --
05-184 +++$+++ 39140 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
05-184 +++$+++ 39141 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- to be clear, that's not the position we're saying that is the DTA. That's not presented here.
05-184 +++$+++ 39142 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I realize --
05-184 +++$+++ 39143 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the issue --
05-184 +++$+++ 39144 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-184 +++$+++ 39145 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- below, in the D.C. Circuit. In addition, we believe that this statute doesn't fall within the Bruner Hallowell presumption that the Government seeks to -- seeks to use here, for a few reasons. The first is, this is not a statute that is merely divesting a lower court of jurisdiction. Rather, it's a statute that alters substantive rights of Mr. Hamdan. In particular, as the Government itself says, it eliminates question 2, upon which certiorari was granted, which is compliance with the Geneva Conventions. In addition, it alters entirely what both courts below found, which is that Mr. Hamdan has a pretrial right, a right analogous to Abney versus United States, to bring his claim now, because he's challenging the jurisdiction of the tribunal. That pretrial right is something that mirrors -- that goes all the way back to the founding, in the early cases that this Court decided, on pretrial habeas. In addition, we believe that --
05-184 +++$+++ 39146 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why does it -- why does it affect the scope of the review that he could get eventually? If there's a final decision, there can be review of whether the use of the standards or procedures that were used by the commission to reach a final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States? Why doesn't that encompass any claim that he might want to make later on?
05-184 +++$+++ 39147 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, as the Government says, it does -- certainly does not encompass question 2, because it eliminates the word "treaties." It's a change from the habeas corpus statute. More generally, it doesn't do two things. First, if that's the reading that the Government wants to give, well, then it essentially means that the -- that the President has the ability to block habeas corpus or post-DTA review for all time, because, Justice Alito, it doesn't turn on -- you can't walk into court right after you're convicted, under the DTA; you can only walk into court after a final decision. And a final decision requires the sign-off of the President of the United States. And so, effectively, this reading would give a litigant the ability to block Federal Court review for all time.
05-184 +++$+++ 39148 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, criminal litigation review after the final decision is the general rule. There generally is not any interlocutory -- any interlocutory appeal. And what you say could happen in any criminal case if you assume bad faith on the part of the people who are responsible for making the decisions along the way. They could delay indefinitely and postpone the entry of a final decision.
05-184 +++$+++ 39149 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia -- Justice Alito, if this were a final -- if this were like a criminal proceeding, we wouldn't be here. The whole point of this is to say we're challenging the lawfulness of the tribunal itself. This isn't a challenge to some decision that a court makes. This is a challenge to the court itself. And that's why it's different than the ordinary criminal context that you're positing. The ordinary criminal context you're positing -- and I'm thinking of a case like Schlesinger versus Councilman, a court-martial case -- what the Court has said is that it's the -- the predicate for abstention is the idea that Congress has fairly balanced the rights of both sides, an independent branch, and has -- and has made certain determinations. Here, none of that has happened. It's all been made by the executive. And the difference is crucial in military justice, because, as Justice Kennedy said for the Court in Loving, the framers harbored a deep distrust of military tribunals. And the thing that makes it different than the ordinary criminal context, the thing that, as this Court said, stops military justice from being lawless is the Congress of the United States setting clear limits on the use of military justice. Now, if those limits had been observed, if this Court -- if the military commission complied with the rules of courts-martial, we wouldn't be here. Our whole point is that they don't, and that it falls outside of the well-recognized abstention exception for courts-martial cases. In addition, we believe that to further -- to further on -- Justice Alito, on your point -- this Court has already said in the military commission context that a different rule applies. In Quirin, this Court rushed in to hear a military-commission challenge before the commission was over, and the reason why it did so was, it said that the public interest required adjudication of these issues. And the public interest is no less severe in that case than it is here. That is, this is a military commission that is literally unbounded by the laws, Constitution, and treaties of the United States. And if you adopt the Government's position here, it effectively replicates the blank check that this Court rejected in Hamdi.
05-184 +++$+++ 39150 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could I come back to Justice Alito's question as to what the normal procedure would be in criminal cases? Suppose you're -- you have a challenge to the makeup of the tribunal in a criminal case. Is it -- is it the normal practice that you would get to raise that challenge? Let's say one of the judges is disqualified for some other reason. Can you normally raise that challenge before the criminal case is filed?
05-184 +++$+++ 39151 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't believe so.
05-184 +++$+++ 39152 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So, there would be nothing different in this situation, if you couldn't raise it until it was final.
05-184 +++$+++ 39153 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, everything is different about this. That is, in your posited hypothetical, there is some law that you know will govern that ultimate question about disqualification or whatever the --
05-184 +++$+++ 39154 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, I know --
05-184 +++$+++ 39155 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the matter is --
05-184 +++$+++ 39156 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the merits of the issue. I'm just talking about the timing of the issue.
05-184 +++$+++ 39157 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I do think that there's an integral relationship to the -- between the two. That is, that the predicate for abstention has always been that Congress, or some other entity, has fairly balanced the rights of both sides. Here, you don't have that fundamental guarantee. Indeed, if you adopt the Government's reading here, the -- they have said that they want to try 75 military-commission cases or so in the first wave. You will then be left with 75 trials that take place without even the most basic question of what the parameters are that these commissions are to operate under.
05-184 +++$+++ 39158 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, when you say Congress hasn't fairly balanced it, I mean, I guess that depends upon your reading of the statute. If, indeed, you read it the way the Government reads it, they would assert that Congress did consider these military commissions and thought that it was okay to wait until they had completed their work before full review was provided.
05-184 +++$+++ 39159 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But --
05-184 +++$+++ 39160 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, it's sort of a -- you know, a -- you're running in a circle.
05-184 +++$+++ 39161 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's precisely, Justice Scalia, our argument, that I don't think one can consider the abstention claim -- and this is what I believe both courts below had held -- you can't consider the abstention claim without deciding the underlying merits. And if you believe that the -- that Congress has fairly balanced the rights and are compliant with the UCMJ and the like, then I don't think -- then you're reaching the merits, and there's no abstention holding. So, if I could turn to the merits -- the merits challenges. The first thing I'd like to discuss on -- is question number 1 and whether this military commission states a charge that violates the laws of war. And we believe it doesn't, for two essential reasons. First, the only charge in this case is one of conspiracy. And conspiracy has been rejected as a violation of the laws of war for -- in every tribunal to consider the issue since World War II. It has been rejected in Nuremberg, it's been rejected in the Tokyo tribunals, it's been rejected in the international tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, and, most importantly, it's been rejected by the Congress of the United States, in 1997 --
05-184 +++$+++ 39162 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Katyal, will you help me? Where is the conspiracy charge in the papers?
05-184 +++$+++ 39163 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The charge itself, Justice Stevens, is found at 63(a) of the Petition appendix.
05-184 +++$+++ 39164 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, thank you very much.
05-184 +++$+++ 39165 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure. And --
05-184 +++$+++ 39166 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And suppose you had a tribunal that was properly constituted, as you contend that it ought to be, and then the charge was conspiracy. Would the -- would the courts then have review before the trial proceeded? And let's assume that it's a conspiracy and some other charge. Is there some analog in ordinary criminal proceedings where you challenge, in advance, the validity of the charge?
05-184 +++$+++ 39167 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Ordinarily, Justice Kennedy, the answer would be no, you wouldn't challenge the validity of the charge. And, indeed, I think Councilman itself is a -- is a case in which there was a charge at issue, and the question was subject-matter jurisdiction. The reason why this is different, however, is twofold. First, the claim that Mr. Hamdan is making is that conspiracy itself falls entirely out of any authorization of Congress. In Councilman, the question was -- there was an article, article 134 of the UCMJ, which was a criminal statute, and it had been interpreted to punish drug dealing. And in the case the court said where -- this Court said, "We will defer as to whether the facts showed the requisite amount of drug dealing to violate the Uniform Code." Here, by contrast, Mr. Hamdan's claim is that the conspiracy charge falls entirely outside of the laws of war as a whole.
05-184 +++$+++ 39168 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could the tribunal interpret the conspiracy charge to mean joint enterprise, which would be closer, at least, to accepted practice in the international tribunals?
05-184 +++$+++ 39169 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The charge itself is one of conspiracy. Joint enterprise is, itself, not an independent charge in international tribunals; so you can charge, for example, murder. And your theory, in an international tribunal, of how you get to murder is joint criminal enterprise. But you'd have to charge the underlying violation, itself. Here --
05-184 +++$+++ 39170 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm still not sure why, if we think that there is merit to your argument that the tribunal is not properly established anyway, that you -- we have to reach the conspiracy charge.
05-184 +++$+++ 39171 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If you --
05-184 +++$+++ 39172 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And if we -- and if we think that you're wrong on that, I don't know why that court can't hear the conspiracy argument.
05-184 +++$+++ 39173 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there's two different reasons. The tribunal is not authorized, and that the charge doesn't state a violation. Now, even if we assume that the tribunal is authorized and that all of its microprocedures are authorized under the act of Congress, this -- allowing this charge, conspiracy, is to open the floodgates to give the President the ability to charge whatever he wants --
05-184 +++$+++ 39174 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's --
05-184 +++$+++ 39175 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- in a military commission.
05-184 +++$+++ 39176 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Katyal, I mean, that's a good argument for -- from a broad policy, but isn't there a narrower reason? If we assume that the -- that the commission is properly established for some purpose, by definition that purpose is limited. We are not dealing here, as we would in the normal criminal case, with a court of general jurisdiction. If we're dealing with a court of general jurisdiction, we postpone claims like yours til the end, because we say the jurisdiction is so broad, they probably had it. Maybe not, but we can wait. But in a -- in a -- in a court of limited jurisdiction, or a commission of limited jurisdiction, we can't indulge that presumption. And that's why, I thought, your claim that conspiracy is not cognizable can be raised at the beginning, because it's inseparable from the limited jurisdiction of the court. Am I off in left field?
05-184 +++$+++ 39177 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You are --
05-184 +++$+++ 39178 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or do you like that answer.
05-184 +++$+++ 39179 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- absolutely correct, Justice --
05-184 +++$+++ 39180 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
05-184 +++$+++ 39181 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- Souter. And, indeed, I would add to that that the conspiracy charge here, Justice Kennedy, is -- the problem with it is compounded by the fact that the tribunal itself is charging a violation of the laws of war, when the military commission has never operated to try violations of terrorism in stateless, territoryless conflicts. That is, it's not just the charge, but it's where the charge operates that we find so central, that the -- that there are two different things --
05-184 +++$+++ 39182 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But is it clear that the --
05-184 +++$+++ 39183 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- there's two different problems.
05-184 +++$+++ 39184 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- charges against your client could not be amended?
05-184 +++$+++ 39185 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They may be amended, yes.
05-184 +++$+++ 39186 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Then why should we -- why should there be review, before trial, of a charge that could be amended?
05-184 +++$+++ 39187 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Be- --
05-184 +++$+++ 39188 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There could be additional charges added by the time there's a final decision.
05-184 +++$+++ 39189 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the -- Justice Alito, the Government has had, essentially, now 4 years to get their charges together on Mr. Hamdan. At this point, that -- you know, what you have before you is the charge. And that -- and they've stuck with this charge, of conspiracy, which is not a violation of the laws of war. And, indeed, the -- and the -- it's not just conspiracy isn't, but that the commission is operating in totally uncharted waters, because it's charging a violation in a stateless, territoryless conflict, something as to which the full laws of war have never applied. Indeed, Justice Alito, all 10 people facing military commissions today, all 10 indictments charge conspiracy right now. Seven only charge conspiracy.
05-184 +++$+++ 39190 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't this contrary to the way legal proceedings and appeals are normally handled? You have a -- essentially, a pretrial appeal concerning the validity of a charge that may not even be the final charge.
05-184 +++$+++ 39191 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not in -- not here, because, as, I think, both courts below indicated, this case, and his challenge, falls very much like Abney versus United States. This is a challenge to the lawfulness of the underlying tribunal and the charge that's against him. Indeed, this Court, in Quirin, heard, as its first question, Does the charge state a violation of the laws of war? That was the first thing it said had to be asked. So, I think the -- what we are doing is applying nothing more than the settled practice that has always been the case with respect to military commissions. And it -- in -- the public interest here, again, just as in Quirin, I think, requires some limits placed on military commissions, Justice Alito, because, otherwise, if the Government's position is taken as the final word, it'll give the President the ability to essentially create that blank check, for years on end, render a final decision at some point, and then that final decision will then be subject to the truncated review procedures in the DTA, which I don't think is what Congress intended when they changed the language of the bill. Rather, I think what they did was intend that this Court would decide the basic -- apply the basic structural limits on military commissions that have always applied.
05-184 +++$+++ 39192 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask this question about the charge? The charge is not just conspiracy in the abstract, it's conspiracy to do specific things, one of which is attacking civilians and civilian objects. And is it clear that the commission would not have -- a military commission would not have jurisdiction to try a conspiracy to armed civilians in a war zone, for example?
05-184 +++$+++ 39193 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is clear, Justice Stevens. That is -- that is precisely what the international tribunals reject. Conspiracy is a standalone offense. One can charge, as a war crime, attacking civilians and the like, as a pure crime, but what you can't do is charge conspiracy. And, indeed, the Congress of the United States, in 1997, when they wrote the War Crimes Act, essentially made that conclusion, because they defined "war crimes" with incorporating a variety of treaties --
05-184 +++$+++ 39194 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, suppose that proof were to show that there was very substantial and knowing involvement rendering him basically an accomplice or a principal, but it was -- it was still found under conspiracy. Would international law violate that?
05-184 +++$+++ 39195 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the --
05-184 +++$+++ 39196 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Assume that he's been given notice of -- during the -- during the course of the proceedings as to what the charges specifically are as the proof is adduced.
05-184 +++$+++ 39197 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Kennedy, on this particular point, on conspiracy, yes, if -- that you couldn't charge some other offense, like aiding and abetting, and transmute some conspiracy charge into that. Rather, the international law and the laws of the United States recognize you can prosecute him for aiding and abetting as a violation of whatever the specific underlying crime is, like murder or attacking civilians. What you can't do is use the standalone offense of conspiracy. And here's why. Because the standalone offense of conspiracy is rejected by international law, because it's too vague. And this Court has said that the test for a violation of the laws of war is when universal agreement and practice make it a violation. The world rejects conspiracy, because if it's adopted it allows so many individuals to get swept up within its net. Justice Kennedy, aiding and abetting requires a much closer relationship between the conduct and the individual offender. Conspiracy does not. And so, for example, under the Government's theory, a little old lady in Switzerland who donates money to al Qaeda, and that turns out to be a front for terrorist acts and so on, might be swept up within this broad definition of conspiracy. And that's why international law has so rejected the concept of conspiracy.
05-184 +++$+++ 39198 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that wouldn't be --
05-184 +++$+++ 39199 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, let me put it this way. If we were to find that the Geneva Convention or other settled principles of international law were controlling here, why couldn't we just remand to the D.C. Circuit and let it figure that out? Or let it -- have the tribunal figure it out, in the first instance, assuming the tribunal is properly authorized.
05-184 +++$+++ 39200 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it is the role of this Court to confine the tribunal to its lawful jurisdiction. That's what this Court held in Quirin. And that's what we think you should do here. The tribunal itself can't be the judge of its own jurisdiction.
05-184 +++$+++ 39201 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, suppose we told the D.C. Circuit that the Geneva Convention or some other body of international law controls, and just remand it for it to go into all these arguments?
05-184 +++$+++ 39202 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Again, we think, at this point, that the public interest is best served by this Court saying that conspiracy doesn't violate -- to set some limits. After all, all -- everyone facing a military commission is facing this charge. Seven are only facing this charge. The Government wants to put 75 of these cases through. And it has taken 4 and a half years since the President's military order --
05-184 +++$+++ 39203 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask --
05-184 +++$+++ 39204 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- for this case --
05-184 +++$+++ 39205 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- this question? Supposing the charge had been slightly amended. Instead of saying, "The criminal purpose, and conspired and agreed with Osama bin Laden to commit the following offenses," it said, "It and Osama bin Laden attempted to -- aided and abetted in committing the following offenses." Would it then be -- violate the laws of war?
05-184 +++$+++ 39206 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If the charge is the specific offenses themselves, not aiding and abetting, Justice Stevens --
05-184 +++$+++ 39207 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the specific offenses are attacking civilians and attacking civilian objects.
05-184 +++$+++ 39208 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, with respect to this particular claim about conspiracy, that would solve that problem. If you say the charge is attacking civilians, and your theory of proving it is aiding and abetting the murder or the attacking of civilians --
05-184 +++$+++ 39209 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And then --
05-184 +++$+++ 39210 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- yes.
05-184 +++$+++ 39211 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- what if the trial judge who looked at the indictment or ruling on a motion to dismiss the indictment, or its equivalent at this time -- said, "Well, I'm going to construe these words 'conspired or agreed' as the substantial equivalent of 'aiding and abetting.'" Would that let the charge stand?
05-184 +++$+++ 39212 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That would mix apples and oranges, because "conspiracy" and "aiding and abetting" are two entirely different things. One is a standalone offense. And one is a theory of how to prove a violation --
05-184 +++$+++ 39213 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the language is "conspired and agreed with." And "agreed with" is pretty close to "tried to do it himself."
05-184 +++$+++ 39214 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's not, Justice Stevens, because it requires a different level of participation, and the liability is entirely different. Because if conspiracy is accepted, you're accepting Pinkerton liability. That's what the Government's own charge said -- the Government's own instruction said, which means that Mr. Hamdan is liable for all the acts of 9/11 and everything al Qaeda has done. "Aiding and abetting," as you are saying, Justice Stevens, in your hypothetical, is a much more closely tethered theory of liability, requiring a higher level of individual culpability and a totally different level of punishment.
05-184 +++$+++ 39215 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As I recall the Sixth Amendment, you're entitled to know the charge against you. And you're saying that the charge of conspiracy is not the charge of aiding and abetting.
05-184 +++$+++ 39216 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That is correct. If I could turn to a second argument for why we believe this military commission is impermissible, and that is that it defies the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Uniform Code of Military Justice, in article 36, sets minimal ground rules for military justice, writ large. And it says that the President can't act in ways that are contrary to, or inconsistent with, this chapter. As Judge Robertson found, already we know that has happened here. Mr. Hamdan has been kicked out of his criminal trial right at the get-go. And the Government's position is that they don't have to abide by the UCMJ, which is a further reason, of course, why we believe that abstention isn't appropriate, because it defies the rules set out by Congress. We're asking this Court to apply the minimal rules of the UCMJ to the military commissions that operate at Guantanamo Bay, because article 2 of the UCMJ has been extended, and its protections now extend to Guantanamo Bay and protect those who are detained there. And one of its protections is the right to be present, and that has been fundamentally violated by -- already. If I could --
05-184 +++$+++ 39217 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You acknowledge the existence of things called commissions. Or don't you?
05-184 +++$+++ 39218 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We do.
05-184 +++$+++ 39219 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean --
05-184 +++$+++ 39220 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
05-184 +++$+++ 39221 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What is the use of them if they have to follow all of the procedures required by the UCMJ? I mean, I thought that the whole object was to have a different procedure.
05-184 +++$+++ 39222 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Scalia, that's what the Government would like you to believe. I don't think that's true. The historical relationship has been that military commissions in courts-martial follow the same procedures. That's what General Crowder said when he testified in 1916, and what this Court has quoted from his testimony. It's what every military treatise says. Now, to be clear, our position is not that military commissions must follow all the rules for courts-martial. Not at all. They must require -- must follow the minimal baseline rules set in the Uniform Code of Military Justice by Congress. They can depart from the panoply of rules, the 867 pages of rules in the Manual for Courts-Martial, so long as they don't depart from the UCMJ itself. Congress has answered this question, Justice Scalia, in article 36, by saying the President does have a wide ability to depart from the rules, but he can't depart from the fundamentals of the UCMJ. And, indeed, that's what --
05-184 +++$+++ 39223 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What fundamentals, other than personal presence, are you concerned with in this case?
05-184 +++$+++ 39224 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
05-184 +++$+++ 39225 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Or is that it?
05-184 +++$+++ 39226 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we do believe that the -- that the entire panoply of UCMJ protection --
05-184 +++$+++ 39227 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I understand --
05-184 +++$+++ 39228 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- is involved.
05-184 +++$+++ 39229 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the nature -- the appointing authority and so forth. But so far as the rights of the defendant at the proceeding --
05-184 +++$+++ 39230 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
05-184 +++$+++ 39231 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- just right to be present? Is there a requirement of prompt convening of the proceedings?
05-184 +++$+++ 39232 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely. There's an article 10 right for speedy charges. There is also an article 67 right for independent Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces review, which is something that is not guaranteed by this commission. And so -- and, indeed, was a predicate for this Court's abstention holding in Councilman. So, we do believe that there are -- that these fundamental rights apply. And, of course, this is just all, Justice Kennedy, default rules. If the -- if the Congress wants to pass a law to exempt military commissions from article 36, that -- they are free to do so, and that will then be -- that'll then be --
05-184 +++$+++ 39233 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But if you have to --
05-184 +++$+++ 39234 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- a separate case --
05-184 +++$+++ 39235 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- approximately the same procedures, what's the point of having a military commission? I think that was implicit in Justice Scalia's question. So, if you go back -- Revolution, Seminoles, Modoc, Mexican War, World War II -- why have them?
05-184 +++$+++ 39236 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, we had them before, because -- we had them before, because we couldn't find military court-martial jurisdiction. They were situations of absolute necessity. The reason was that the Articles of War, for one reason or another, didn't cover particular individuals. And, therefore, we needed to craft a separate procedure. But, whenever we did so, Justice Breyer, we always said that court-martial rules apply. In 1847, which is really the first instance of a military commission, because General Washington operated under statutory charges to try spying -- but in 1847, we applied court-martial rules by General Order Number 1. In the Civil War, we applied General Order Number 1 again, and it said that it would -- that we needed to apply to court-martial -- court-martial rules, because, otherwise, abuses would arise. And, essentially, the worry is one of forum shopping, that you give the President the ability to pick a forum and define the rules. And that -- and that fundamentally open-ended authority is what I believe this Court rejected in Hamdi, and it's -- and when it rejected the blank check.
05-184 +++$+++ 39237 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Katyal, you've addressed the Detainee Treatment act in its -- in its capacity as, arguably, removing jurisdiction. Might not the act also function as a retroactive approval of what the President has done?
05-184 +++$+++ 39238 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Certainly, there's nothing in the text of the act itself -- and even -- I know this isn't relevant for you, but for other individuals on the Court -- there's nothing in the legislative history, or even the post -- even the brief filed by Senators Graham and Kyl, which suggest, in any way, that this was ratification. But suppose it were, Justice Scalia. Suppose it did ratify some sort of military commission. I don't believe that it authorized this military commission with this charge, conspiracy, in this conflict, a stateless, territoryless conflict, with these procedures, procedures that violate the UCMJ. So, it may be that they authorized something. But even that, I think, may be a bit hard, because, after all, what they did was authorize, as Justice Alito said, certain challenges to military commissions.
05-184 +++$+++ 39239 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think, as a minimum, that they authorized a military commission?
05-184 +++$+++ 39240 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They -- I think it's perfectly -- well, it's a -- it's a -- it is a possible reading to say the DTA authorized some sort of military commission. The text doesn't say so. It is, of course, addressed to the jurisdiction of this Court, and not in any way to the -- to the -- to the -- to the underlying merits. I do think that the -- that there is a -- you know, a conceivable argument. However, the reason why I think this Court, if it did decide to reach that ultimate question, should reach it against the Government, is that that kind of back-door kind of -- you know, approval by inference has never been sufficient when it comes to authorizing military jurisdiction, in the most awesome powers of the Government, to dispense life imprisonment and death. That is, I think, a clearer statement would be required in this unique setting, because we aren't talking about, after all, minor things. We're talking about the most grave powers of our Government, the power to dispense life imprisonment and death. And I certainly don't think Congress, on the basis of a few hours of debate, intended to ratify this entire apparatus. If I could turn to question 2 and the Geneva Conventions, I'd like to start with Common Article 3 and its minimal baseline requirements that a regularly constituted court be set up, and one that dispense -- that affords the rights indispensable to civilized peoples. As Judge Williams found, below, that article does apply to Mr. Hamdan, and protects him. It's the most minimal rudimentary requirements that the United States Senate adhered to when it ratified the convention in 1955. And those requirements --
05-184 +++$+++ 39241 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It depends on what you mean by "regularly constituted." In your brief, I gather you -- what you meant is that a court that was pre-existing. It doesn't necessarily mean that. It just -- it could mean one that was set up for the occasion, but was set up for the occasion by proper procedures. Wouldn't that be a "regularly constituted court"?
05-184 +++$+++ 39242 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think the way that it has been interpreted, "regularly constituted court," is not an ad hoc court with ad hoc rules. So, that is to say, Justice Scalia, if they resuscitated --
05-184 +++$+++ 39243 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I mean, not ad hoc in that sense, "I'm creating one court for this defendant, another court for the other defendant," but setting up for the occasion, and for trying numerous defendants, a new court. I don't think that, just because it's a new court, you can say that it's not a "regularly constituted court."
05-184 +++$+++ 39244 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So long as it is, (a) independent of the executive, which is what it's been interpreted to be, and, (b) affords the rights known to civilized peoples. And here, we think this military commission strays from both of those -- both of those. It's not independent of the executive --
05-184 +++$+++ 39245 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You've mentioned -- you've mentioned that the defendant has no right to appear before the tribunal. What are the other rights recognized by all civilized people that these tribunals do not guarantee?
05-184 +++$+++ 39246 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So far, Justice Ginsburg, all that we have before -- you know, I think all that's happened is the right to be present. To look to what other rights are guaranteed by Common Article 3, you can look to Additional Protocol 1 of the Geneva Conventions, which specifies rights like appeal rights and the like. But they're the most minimal baseline rights. We're not talking about, you know, Miranda rights or something like that. We're talking about just a set of core ideas that every country on the world -- every country in the world is supposed to dispense when they create war-crimes trials. And, even that minimal standard, the Government says they don't want to apply here. And why we think this is enforceable is that Mr. Hamdan is being prosecuted in the name of the laws of war. And he has the right to invoke the Geneva Conventions defensively as a -- as a way to constrain the tribunal, to say that they can't --
05-184 +++$+++ 39247 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How do you want us to view his status? Do we accept the Government's submission that there's probable cause to believe that he was not of -- in a formal uniform, that he was not a formal combatant, but that he was aiding and abetting, or conspiring, with al Qaeda? Can we accept that, that there's probable cause for that?
05-184 +++$+++ 39248 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Justice Kennedy, for two reasons.
05-184 +++$+++ 39249 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, in -- particularly based on the CSRT hearing?
05-184 +++$+++ 39250 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The CSRT, to my knowledge, never asked any of those --
05-184 +++$+++ 39251 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you have to --
05-184 +++$+++ 39252 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- questions about --
05-184 +++$+++ 39253 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- you have to give us --
05-184 +++$+++ 39254 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- uniforms or --
05-184 +++$+++ 39255 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- a beginning point. You have to give us a beginning point.
05-184 +++$+++ 39256 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We would love a beginning point. And the beginning point is an article 5 hearing, which is required by Army Regulation 190-8, in article 5 of the Geneva Conventions. The CSRT in no way suffices to do that. It didn't ask those questions about, Are -- you know, uniforms, and the like, to my knowledge. Of course, the CSRT isn't in the record, so we don't really know. The Government said, below, that it had, quote, "zero effect on this case," and didn't introduce it. But, be that as it may, suppose that the CSRT did decide that Mr. Hamdan is an enemy combatant. Justice Kennedy, most enemy combatants are prisoners of war. So, if anything, all the CSRT did was affirm Mr. Hamdan's separate claim, apart from Common Article 3, to the full protection of the Geneva Conventions. If I --
05-184 +++$+++ 39257 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that would require a determination by a different tribunal that he was not a POW, in default of which he would be treated as a POW and be entitled to a court-martial? Is that the point?
05-184 +++$+++ 39258 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Justice --
05-184 +++$+++ 39259 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-184 +++$+++ 39260 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- Souter. If I could reserve the balance of my time.
05-184 +++$+++ 39261 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, you certainly may. General Clement.
05-184 +++$+++ 39263 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court: The executive branch has long exercised the authority to try enemy combatants by military commissions. That authority was part and parcel of George Washington's authority as Commander in Chief of the Revolutionary Forces, as dramatically illustrated by the case of Major Andre. And that authority was incorporated into the Constitution. Congress has repeatedly recognized and sanctioned that authority. Indeed, each time Congress has extended the jurisdiction of the court-martials, Congress was at pains to emphasize that that extension did not come in derogation of the jurisdiction of military commissions. And in its most recent action, Congress clearly did not operate as somebody who viewed the military commissions as ultra vires. They offered no immediate review, and no review at all for charges resulting in a conviction of less than 10 years. Of course, even more clearly, Congress's most recent action made it clear that the courts no longer have jurisdiction over pre-enforcement challenges. And it's to that I'd like to turn first.
05-184 +++$+++ 39264 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But let me just ask this question, Mr. Clement. What sources of law have the commissions generally enforced over the years, beginning with George Washington and so forth? Just Army regulations or American law or foreign law? What are the basic sources of law that they can enforce?
05-184 +++$+++ 39265 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, what I would say, Justice Stevens, is, they basically enforce the laws of war. At times, there are obviously United States sources that are relevant to that. Obviously, if you have a field manual or something that says specifically that certain offenses are triable under the law of war, that would be very instructive in the tribunals. In certain situations that I don't think are principally relevant here, you might also have war courts that were set up to deal with municipal offenses. But that's not what we have. And then, they would look to U.S. law.
05-184 +++$+++ 39266 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And what we have here is enforcement of the laws of war.
05-184 +++$+++ 39267 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is right. And, of course, in this context, you have a controlling executive act in the form of the regulations themselves that make it clear that the executive views things like conspiracy to violate the laws of war to be actionable under the laws of war. Now --
05-184 +++$+++ 39268 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If -- just one hypothetical. Assume that the laws of war do not prohibit conspiracy. Just assume -- I know you disagree with that. Could the President, by his action, add conspiracy as a triable offense by a commission?
05-184 +++$+++ 39269 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think if you did that, Justice Stevens, it would present the very difficult question that this Court has never squarely addressed, which is, does the President have some authority to try, by military commission, beyond that which Congress has joined him in? Obviously, article 21 of the UCMJ gives Congress's sanction to any military commissions, to the extent they try crimes that are triable by the law of war. So, in that sense, I think, as long as this Court construes consistent with over 100 years of United States tradition and history, the conspiracy to commit a law -- a violation of the law of war is a war crime, then you don't have to reach that --
05-184 +++$+++ 39270 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if --
05-184 +++$+++ 39271 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- difficult issue.
05-184 +++$+++ 39272 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's easy if it is a war crime. I'm trying to wrestle with the question of, if we concluded that it were not, and just -- and I'm asking -- can the question add an additional crime that the commission could try?
05-184 +++$+++ 39273 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think he --
05-184 +++$+++ 39274 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ You think he could.
05-184 +++$+++ 39275 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think we would take the position that he could, as a matter of pure constitutional power. I don't think, though -- he has not acted in this case on the theory that conspiracy is outside of the laws of war. He's acted inconsistent with 150 years of tradition.
05-184 +++$+++ 39276 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So, the basic position you're asserting is that we have -- that the -- this commission intends to try a violation of the laws of war. And do the laws of war then have any application to the procedures that they have to follow?
05-184 +++$+++ 39277 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. I mean, in the sense that I think that if there were -- there -- the other side is certainly able to argue, before the military commissions, that certain procedural provisions or the like are prohibited by the law of war or give them some greater entitlement. Now, as this Court has recognized in cases like Madsen, I don't think that the law of war is -- you know, extensively regulates procedure. And, indeed, as the Madsen Court recognized, Congress's approach to military commissions has been radically different than its approach to court-martials. In court-martials, they regulate every jot and tittle of the procedure. And if the UCMJ and its provisions for court-martials applies, then the defendants are going to get not just Miranda, but Miranda plus, and a whole panoply of rights. If, on the other hand, this Court follows the precedents in Madsen, it will recognize that only those nine provisions of the UCMJ that expressly reference military commissions will apply, and the rest is left to a much more common-law, war-court approach, where there's much greater flexibility.
05-184 +++$+++ 39278 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What do you -- what do you make of the argument that Mr. Katyal just alluded to, that if you take the -- as you do -- take the position that the commissions are operating under the laws of war, you've got to accept that one law of war here is the Geneva Convention right to a presumption of POW status unless there is a determination by a competent tribunal otherwise, with the -- among other things, the rights that that carries. I mean, how -- do you -- why not -- why don't you go from the frying pan into the fire, in effect, when you take the position that the laws of war are what the tribunal is applying?
05-184 +++$+++ 39279 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Souter, I don't think there's any frying pan effect or fire effect, precisely because what you have with respect to the claim that the Geneva Conventions applies -- okay, that claim could be brought to the military commissions, but they could adjudicate it and say that the Geneva Conventions don't apply here, for any number of reasons. And I think that this idea that there needs to be an article 5 proceeding --
05-184 +++$+++ 39280 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but you're -- are you saying that the -- that the commission will adjudicate POW status under the Geneva Convention? In other words, are you stipulating that the Geneva Convention does apply, so that the only argument left between you and Mr. Katyal would be whether the commission itself was a competent tribunal to make the determination? Is that your position?
05-184 +++$+++ 39281 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think so, Justice Souter. I mean, I think the disagreement is more fundamental than that. What I would say is, a claim could be brought in the tribunal that the Geneva Conventions apply. Now, just because the Geneva Convention does apply --
05-184 +++$+++ 39282 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, do you agree that it applies as part of the law of war?
05-184 +++$+++ 39283 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think, consistent with the position of the executive, that the Geneva Convention applies in this particular conflict.
05-184 +++$+++ 39284 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that, I guess, is the problem that I'm having. For purposes of determining the domestic authority to set up a commission, you say, the President is operating under the laws of war recognized by Congress, but for purposes of a claim to status, and, hence, the procedural rights that go with that status, you're saying the laws of war don't apply. And I don't see how you can have it both ways.
05-184 +++$+++ 39285 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We're not trying to have it both ways, Justice Souter. The fact that the Geneva Conventions are part of the law of war doesn't mean that Petitioner is entitled to any protection under those conventions. And --
05-184 +++$+++ 39286 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But he is entitled to make a claim under them to determine whether, on the merits, he is entitled. Isn't that entailed by your position?
05-184 +++$+++ 39287 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think it is, Your Honor, but let me just say that that's a claim that he could have brought before the CSRTs, and that is a claim he can still bring before the military commissions.
05-184 +++$+++ 39288 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I have --
05-184 +++$+++ 39289 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Lawful --
05-184 +++$+++ 39290 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- I have -- I have trouble with the argument that -- insofar as he says there is a structural invalidity to the military commission, that he brings that before the commission. The historic office of habeas is to test whether or not you are being tried by a lawful tribunal. And he says, under the Geneva Convention, as you know, that it isn't.
05-184 +++$+++ 39291 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, and we disagree with those claims. We think that most of those claims -- to the extent that he thinks some procedural requirement is provided either by the Geneva Convention, if applicable -- but we don't think it would be -- and that argument would be made; but, if by some other, sort of, principle of the law of war that a procedure is required --
05-184 +++$+++ 39292 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it's not some --
05-184 +++$+++ 39293 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- he could -- he could make that argument.
05-184 +++$+++ 39294 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- procedural -- it's the structural requirement of the composition and the -- and the appointing origins of the court.
05-184 +++$+++ 39295 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, again, I think he could -- he could bring that claim. I don't think it would be well taken by the -- by the commission. I don't think it's a valid claim. I also don't think, if -- there's any reason why that claim has to be brought at this stage in the procedure. We think that abstention --
05-184 +++$+++ 39296 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought --
05-184 +++$+++ 39297 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- principles --
05-184 +++$+++ 39298 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought we -- I thought we established, earlier -- somebody told me -- that, in the normal criminal suit, even if you claim that the forum is not properly constituted, that claim is not adjudicated immediately, it's adjudicated at the conclusion of the proceeding.
05-184 +++$+++ 39299 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, of course that's true. And --
05-184 +++$+++ 39300 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We --
05-184 +++$+++ 39301 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- also --
05-184 +++$+++ 39302 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We don't -- we don't intervene on habeas corpus when somebody says that the panel is improperly constituted. We wait until the proceeding's terminated, normally.
05-184 +++$+++ 39303 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's exactly right, Justice Scalia. And this Court made clear that it doesn't intervene --
05-184 +++$+++ 39304 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, is --
05-184 +++$+++ 39305 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- even when a U.S. --
05-184 +++$+++ 39306 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- is that -- is that true? If a group of people decides they're going to try somebody, we wait until that group of people finishes the trial before the Court -- before habeas intervenes to determine the authority of the tribunal to hold and to try?
05-184 +++$+++ 39307 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, with respect, Justice Kennedy, this isn't a "group of people." This is the President invoking an authority that he's exercised in virtually every war that we've had. It's something that was recognized in the Civil War, something in the World War II that this Court approved.
05-184 +++$+++ 39308 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I had thought that the historic function of habeas is to -- one of its functions -- is to test the jurisdiction and the legitimacy of a court.
05-184 +++$+++ 39309 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but -- habeas corpus generally doesn't give a right to a pre-enforcement challenge. And this Court, for example, in Schlesinger against Councilman --
05-184 +++$+++ 39310 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To a forum that is prima facie properly constituted. I mean, it -- this is not a -- you know, a necktie party. Where it parades as a court, and it's been constituted as a court, we normally wait until the proceeding's completed.
05-184 +++$+++ 39311 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that's exactly right, Justice Scalia. And Congress has spoken to this precise issue in the DTA. Whatever was the question about applying --
05-184 +++$+++ 39312 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, Mr. Clement --
05-184 +++$+++ 39313 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- judge made --
05-184 +++$+++ 39314 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- if you assume that the laws of war apply, and perhaps the treaty applies, isn't the issue whether this is a "group of people," on the one hand, or a "regularly constituted court," on the other?
05-184 +++$+++ 39315 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I mean, I don't really think there's any serious dispute about which it is. I mean, this is something that is --
05-184 +++$+++ 39316 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they argue very strenuously that this is really just a "group of people" --
05-184 +++$+++ 39317 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well -- and if this Court --
05-184 +++$+++ 39318 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- because it's not a "regularly constituted court" within the meaning of the treaty.
05-184 +++$+++ 39319 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Stevens, I think that even if a court might have had jurisdiction to hear just that issue and --
05-184 +++$+++ 39320 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-184 +++$+++ 39321 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- nothing else before the DTA, Congress has now spoken, and Congress has made it clear that, whatever else is true, these military commission proceedings can proceed, and exclusive review can be done after the fact, after conviction, in the D.C. Circuit.
05-184 +++$+++ 39322 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Exclusive review of what? I don't see that the -- that the -- that the DTA preserves a right to review of the very issue that they want to raise here.
05-184 +++$+++ 39323 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think I disagree, at least --
05-184 +++$+++ 39324 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They can -- they can -- they can review their enemy combatant determination. They can review the consistency of the procedure of the court with whatever law applies. But I don't see that there is a clear reservation of right to get to the very basic question of the -- of the constitution of the court itself.
05-184 +++$+++ 39325 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Oh, I disagree, Justice Souter. E(3) specifically preserves the claim that the commissions were not, and the procedures were not, consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States --
05-184 +++$+++ 39326 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So, you're reading --
05-184 +++$+++ 39327 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to the extent --
05-184 +++$+++ 39328 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- procedures --
05-184 +++$+++ 39329 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- they're pledgeable.
05-184 +++$+++ 39330 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to encompass the very act constituting the court itself? Is that the Government's -- I mean, are you going to go on the record --
05-184 +++$+++ 39331 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Sure, if they want to come in and argue that there is a violation of article 21 of the UCMJ, or article 36 of the UCMJ, after their conviction, they are perfectly free to do that --
05-184 +++$+++ 39332 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's hard for me to --
05-184 +++$+++ 39333 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- under E(3), but --
05-184 +++$+++ 39334 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- see that with the language of this, because the language that you're talking about refers to "such standards." "Such standards and procedures" refer to the preceding paragraph, which is standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (a). That military order is an order of August 31st which talks about procedures. It's not the order that sets up the commission, which is an order issued the preceding November. Rather, this language seems to mean what it says. But even if it didn't -- even if it didn't, wouldn't your reading raise a terrifically difficult constitutional question, if not this case, in cases that are pending right now, where prisoners in Guantanamo are claiming that they have not yet had the CSRT hearing, they're claiming, one or two, "We had it, and we're still here. We won, but we're still here." They're claiming, "We don't want to be sent back to Qatar." And they're claiming, some, that they were tortured. All right? Now, if we could avoid that case with your interpretation here, and avoid that constitutional question -- we can't avoid it. So, my question is, one, How is what you're arguing consistent with the language I quoted? And, two, How could it, if we accepted your interpretation, possibly avoid the most terribly difficult and important constitutional question of whether Congress can constitutionally deprive this Court of jurisdiction in habeas cases?
05-184 +++$+++ 39335 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Breyer, let me answer both pieces of that. I certainly think that such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States. There is a reference to the first military order. I believe there's also a reference to any other subsequent orders implementing that. All of that, together, implements the November 13th order. So, I would think that there is -- it is very easy to read this language to allow any challenge that is being brought here, with the possible exception of the treaty challenge.
05-184 +++$+++ 39336 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would you --
05-184 +++$+++ 39337 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And --
05-184 +++$+++ 39338 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Would you --
05-184 +++$+++ 39339 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- I think the language is capacious enough if the treaty challenge is what you thought was very important, the D.C. Circuit, at the end of the day, could decide whether or not there is a requirement that the treaty challenge be brought.
05-184 +++$+++ 39340 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ General Clement, if you can straighten me out on the piece that you read about "consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States," I thought that it was the Government's position that these enemy combatants do not have any rights under the Constitution and laws of the United States.
05-184 +++$+++ 39341 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is true, Justice Ginsburg. And Congress, in this act, was very careful to basically write without prejudice to the answer to that question. So, we would have that argument. The other side would have their argument. What this act provides that we don't have any argument on, that was something that wasn't before this Court, say, in the Rasul decision, was the fact that the procedures that the military has promulgated are going to be enforceable under this exclusive review provision. So, there at least will be some law to apply now under this exclusive review provision.
05-184 +++$+++ 39342 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But what --
05-184 +++$+++ 39343 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So, that --
05-184 +++$+++ 39344 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But how will the question, whether the laws in the United -- and Constitution -- of the United States, whether these petitioners have any claim to state under the laws and Constitution of the United States? Because as I read -- the review that's provided doesn't open up that question. It's a very narrow review that's given to the D.C. Circuit.
05-184 +++$+++ 39345 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Ginsburg, I certainly think that Petitioner will be up there arguing that Eisentrager is no longer good law, not just as a statutory matter, as a constitutional matter, and those arguments will be made. Without respect to that, certainly the arguments about article 21 and Article 36, that are very much the centerpiece of their argument here today, would also be available to the D.C. Circuit. And if there's some constitutional requirement that that review be slightly broader or slightly narrower, that seems like something that can better be adjudicated in the context of a concrete case at the point that that review is sought.
05-184 +++$+++ 39346 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there --
05-184 +++$+++ 39347 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But one thing I --
05-184 +++$+++ 39348 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is there -- is there any review in this Court, following the D.C. Circuit, either the original classification or the conviction -- is there -- does this Court have any part in the scheme?
05-184 +++$+++ 39349 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Justice Ginsburg, there would be 1254 review. Once the provision is in the court of appeals, then the case would be under -- under E(3), the review provision -- then the case would be in the court of appeals for purposes of this Court's 1254 jurisdiction.
05-184 +++$+++ 39350 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I still don't see the answer to my question, which had two parts. As to the language, (a) which is what's cross-referenced, refers to Military Commission Order Number 1, August 31, 2005, or any successor military order. The order, as I understand it, that's created the commission by the President, is an order which was November 13, 2001, not a successor to 2005. But leaving the language aside, what I'm mostly interested in, because I think your interpretation inevitably creates it, is, what is the answer to the claim that it is not constitutional for Congress, without suspending the writ of habeas corpus, to accomplish the same result by removing jurisdiction from the courts in a significant number of cases, even one?
05-184 +++$+++ 39351 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Breyer, let me answer that question in two parts, which is to say that I think that this case, and most of the cases, don't raise a serious Suspension Clause problem, for the simple reason that I think deferring review or channeling it to the court of appeals does not amount to a suspension.
05-184 +++$+++ 39352 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I listed four sets of cases that I don't see how you could possibly shoehorn into E(2) and E(3), even if you are able to shoehorn this one. And my language was designed to make you see how difficult it is.
05-184 +++$+++ 39353 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, but --
05-184 +++$+++ 39354 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I listed four that I don't see how anybody could shoehorn into that.
05-184 +++$+++ 39355 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But, with respect, Justice Breyer, I think that cuts both ways, because I don't think there's any particular interpretation of these provisions on the table before this Court that's going to eliminate those potential Suspension Clause issues.
05-184 +++$+++ 39356 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the whole point, it seems to me, of the argument, is, should we not consider the significance of those very questions, because, if we don't, as Justice Breyer said, at the end of the day, as you describe it, we will have to face the serious constitutional question whether Congress can, in fact, limit jurisdiction without suspending habeas corpus? The whole point is to grapple with them now, and to -- and to treat them in a way that allows for this adjudication, so that we avoid this constitutional difficulty tomorrow.
05-184 +++$+++ 39357 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Justice Souter, first of all, I would think general principles of constitutional avoidance would say deferring the constitutional question is a good thing, not a bad thing. The one point I would --
05-184 +++$+++ 39358 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We may not have to reach the constitutional question. That's what -- that's what constitutional avoidance hopes for.
05-184 +++$+++ 39359 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right. But I don't see any argument on the other side that's really a constitutional avoidance argument. Their principal argument is --
05-184 +++$+++ 39360 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, the argument --
05-184 +++$+++ 39361 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- don't apply this --
05-184 +++$+++ 39362 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the other side -- if you want the argument, the other side is, there are several hundred cases already pending. And, therefore, if we accept your interpretation, we know we have to reach the constitutional argument. If we reject your interpretation, since all these cases, several hundred of them, are already there, it might be: new ones won't be brought. But, of course, "new ones won't" might. And, therefore, what is your answer to --
05-184 +++$+++ 39363 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well --
05-184 +++$+++ 39364 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the question that this is unconstitutional -- if not here, in other places?
05-184 +++$+++ 39365 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And, Justice Breyer, what I would say is that our interpretation basically provides for pending claims exactly the way that Congress did. With respect to any future claims that might be brought, there may or may not be a constitutional question. And if I could turn to our interpretation of the DTA, it's the only one that really, I think, reads the various provisions in the statute in harmony. Now, this Court's decision in Bruner, and in a host of other cases, says that when Congress eliminates jurisdiction, pending cases fall, unless there's a savings clause. The closest thing to a savings clause in this statute, in E(1), is the provision that says "except pursuant to Section 1005." And I think that's important, because if Congress wanted to put in a savings clause of the kind that this Court seems to refer to in Bruner, and that would certainly be consistent with Senator Levin's intent, it would have been very easy. Instead of saying "except for Section 1005," they could have said "except for pending cases." The choice is important, because what does Section 1005 provide? It provides the exclusive review in E(2) and E(3). And then, H(2), in very complementary fashion, says that, just in case there's any question about it, those provisions on E(2) and E(3) apply to pending claims governed by those sections. I think every word's important. It doesn't say "pending cases," it says "pending claims." Congress understood two important things. There were no cases currently pending under E(2) and E(3), because Congress was creating E(2) and E(3). It also knew that most of the cases before the D.C. Courts had some claims that were pure challenges to the final CSRT determination and other claims. So, what H(2) says is -- H(2) says that, to the extent those cases involve claims governed by E(2) and E(3), they are preserved under E(2) and E(3); otherwise, this -- there's no savings clause that covers those claims, and their jurisdiction is removed. The --
05-184 +++$+++ 39366 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask --
05-184 +++$+++ 39367 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- retroactivity aspect -- I'm sorry.
05-184 +++$+++ 39368 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I just ask this, just to clarify? When they do take away some jurisdiction of some habeas corpus claims, do you defend that, in part, as a permissible exercise of the power to suspend the writ, or do you say it is not a suspension of the writ?
05-184 +++$+++ 39369 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think both, ultimately. I mean, I don't think --
05-184 +++$+++ 39370 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It can't be both. [Laughter.]
05-184 +++$+++ 39371 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I -- I don't see why I can't have alternative arguments here, as for anywhere else, Justice Stevens. We think that Congress, in this action, did not do anything that triggers the suspension of the writ. But if you think that --
05-184 +++$+++ 39372 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, that --
05-184 +++$+++ 39373 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- it did, I think that --
05-184 +++$+++ 39374 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that's your position, they did not suspend the writ. You're not arguing that it's a justifiable suspension of the writ.
05-184 +++$+++ 39375 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think that the terms of the Suspension Clause would be satisfied here because of the exigencies of 9/11. If the question is, am I taking the position that Congress consciously thought that it was suspending the writ, then I would say no.
05-184 +++$+++ 39376 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
05-184 +++$+++ 39377 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if you think, in order for there be to a -- to be a valid suspension, Congress has to do it consciously, then I think you could see why the arguments are mutually exclusive. My view would be that if Congress, sort of, stumbles upon a suspension of the writ, but the preconditions are satisfied, that would still be constitutionally valid. So, I think that may be the disagreement.
05-184 +++$+++ 39378 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't there a --
05-184 +++$+++ 39379 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean --
05-184 +++$+++ 39380 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Isn't there a pretty good argument that a suspension of the writ of Congress is just about the most stupendously significant act that the Congress of the United States can take? And, therefore, we ought to be at least a little slow to accept your argument that it can be done from pure inadvertence?
05-184 +++$+++ 39381 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, a couple of things, Justice Souter. I would agree with you if what we were talking about is suspending the right as to citizens within the Continental United States, but all Congress did here is restore the law to the understanding of the law that had prevailed for 200 years. Now, this Court obviously took a different view --
05-184 +++$+++ 39382 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If we have to --
05-184 +++$+++ 39383 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- in Rasul.
05-184 +++$+++ 39384 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- get to the issue, in accordance with Justice Breyer's question, whether or not the writ of habeas corpus was suspended, you are leaving us with the position of the United States that the Congress may validly suspend it inadvertently. Is that really your position?
05-184 +++$+++ 39385 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think at least if you're talking about the extension of the writ to enemy combatants --
05-184 +++$+++ 39386 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The writ is the --
05-184 +++$+++ 39387 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- held outside --
05-184 +++$+++ 39388 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The writ is the --
05-184 +++$+++ 39389 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- the territory of the United States --
05-184 +++$+++ 39390 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Now, wait a minute. The writ is the writ.
05-184 +++$+++ 39391 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay.
05-184 +++$+++ 39392 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There are not two writs of habeas corpus for some cases and for other cases. The rights that -- the rights that may be asserted, the rights that may be vindicated, will vary with the circumstances, but jurisdiction over habeas corpus is jurisdiction over habeas corpus. And it seems to me that the position you have taken is that if, at the end of the day, we have to reach the question that Justice Breyer described, the answer to that question may be, "Yes, the writ of habeas corpus was suspended by inadvertence. Congress did not intend to do it." Is that really your position?
05-184 +++$+++ 39393 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, Justice Souter. There's no -- my point is not inadvertence. It's whether they have to say or incant any magic words that they are now invoking their power --
05-184 +++$+++ 39394 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ They could surely --
05-184 +++$+++ 39395 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to suspend the writ.
05-184 +++$+++ 39396 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- set forth a procedure which amounts to a suspension of the writ. And if that procedure is done in a state of insurrection or invasion, that would constitute a suspension of the writ, even though they don't say, "We are suspending the writ of habeas corpus."
05-184 +++$+++ 39397 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is my point. And there's nothing inadvertent here --
05-184 +++$+++ 39398 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it also your point when there is no insurrection or invasion?
05-184 +++$+++ 39399 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, then any effort to suspend the writ would be invalid. But this is not a case where there's any question of --
05-184 +++$+++ 39400 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Perhaps that's something that a court ought to inquire into when it gets into the question of congressional intent.
05-184 +++$+++ 39401 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think --
05-184 +++$+++ 39402 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And how specific --
05-184 +++$+++ 39403 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- I disagree with that.
05-184 +++$+++ 39404 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that intent --
05-184 +++$+++ 39405 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I guess my point would --
05-184 +++$+++ 39406 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and how specific that intent must be.
05-184 +++$+++ 39407 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think I disagree with that. But there's two separate points here, is that -- one is, does Congress have to say, "We are now suspending the writ under our Suspension Clause"? And I don't think there's any call to say that they have to do that. Obviously, in cases like St. Cyr, this Court has been very clear to say, "Congress obviously can't stumble upon the Habeas Clause."
05-184 +++$+++ 39408 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Okay. Let's --
05-184 +++$+++ 39409 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But that's not --
05-184 +++$+++ 39410 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let's --
05-184 +++$+++ 39411 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- at issue here.
05-184 +++$+++ 39412 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let's assume we do not have a magic-words requirement. Given the significance of suspending the writ of habeas corpus, should we not have a pretty clear statement requirement?
05-184 +++$+++ 39413 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes. And there's no question that Congress, here, tried to amend the habeas statute. This is not like St. Cyr, where they didn't go after 2241 in terms. There's nothing subtle about this statute with respect to the clarity with which it speaks --
05-184 +++$+++ 39414 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There may be nothing --
05-184 +++$+++ 39415 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to the habeas statute.
05-184 +++$+++ 39416 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- subtle about the statute, but there is something very silent about the statute as to whether Congress understood that it was -- that it was acting under its authority to suspend the writ of habeas corpus. And, at the very least, that unclarity is manifested by the effective-date provision. H(1) doesn't have the language that it had before the amendment. Therefore, it seems to me, there would be some difficulty, if we have to get to the question, in finding a clear intent on the part of Congress to suspend the writ under its article I power.
05-184 +++$+++ 39417 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With respect, Justice Souter, I don't think making a retroactivity analysis or holding here is going to spare you the trouble of dealing with the Suspension Clause argument. I mean, in St. Cyr, it's worth noting that this Court addressed the specificity with which the statute applied separately from the retroactivity question. Here, to take the first question first, there's no question, this wolf comes as a wolf. Congress was going after 2241. It clearly did that. All of E(1) --
05-184 +++$+++ 39418 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It comes --
05-184 +++$+++ 39419 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- is a new subsection.
05-184 +++$+++ 39420 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It comes as a wolf under H(2), but the wolf is silent under H(1), and the wolf used to speak under H(1), and it had its teeth taken out. [Laughter.]
05-184 +++$+++ 39421 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ With respect, Justice Souter, H(1) never spoke to the question. An earlier provision, D(1), had very different language, in an earlier provision of the statute, that spoke with greater clarity. I'll grant --
05-184 +++$+++ 39422 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And that's --
05-184 +++$+++ 39423 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- you that.
05-184 +++$+++ 39424 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- gone.
05-184 +++$+++ 39425 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's gone. But just because Congress could have made it clearer doesn't mean that the Government loses here.
05-184 +++$+++ 39426 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The very fact --
05-184 +++$+++ 39427 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Senator --
05-184 +++$+++ 39428 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that Congress chose to remove the clarity of the prior provision is of no significance?
05-184 +++$+++ 39429 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's not of dispositive significance, Justice Souter.
05-184 +++$+++ 39430 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't think Congress chose to do that. One house of Congress chose to do it. We don't know what the other house thought, and we don't know what the President thought.
05-184 +++$+++ 39431 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's a very fair point, Justice Scalia. But even to get at the very -- what happened here is very analogous to the legislative evolution this Court found unilluminating in Martin against Haddocks. There, the attorneys fees provision you had before it -- before you, used to be in 802 of the statute, which was expressly applicable to pending cases. Congress moved it out into its own separate section that didn't expressly apply to pending cases.
05-184 +++$+++ 39432 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What --
05-184 +++$+++ 39433 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ This Court did not --
05-184 +++$+++ 39434 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Whatever may be the standard of due care for courts in reviewing acts of Congress with respect to attorneys fees, it doesn't reach the level that, it seems to me, is incumbent on us when we're talking about suspending the writ of habeas corpus.
05-184 +++$+++ 39435 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't disagree with that, Justice Souter, but there's no special habeas retroactivity law. There is a special rule, under St. Cyr, for habeas, but we amply satisfy that, because --
05-184 +++$+++ 39436 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can --
05-184 +++$+++ 39437 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- 22- --
05-184 +++$+++ 39438 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-184 +++$+++ 39439 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- this whole thing is a 2241(e) new section. So, this is all about amending habeas.
05-184 +++$+++ 39440 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May I ask you another question about the clarity with which Congress spoke? This law was proposed and enacted some weeks after this Court granted cert in this very case. It is an extraordinary act, I think, to withdraw jurisdiction from this Court in a pending case. Congress didn't say, explicitly, it was doing that. It hasn't done it, as far as I know, since McArdle. But there Congress said, "We are withdrawing jurisdiction in this very case." They didn't say that here. So, why should we assume that Congress withdraw our jurisdiction to hear this case once the case was already lodged here?
05-184 +++$+++ 39441 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the answer, Justice Ginsburg, is that, you're right, this isn't like ex parte McArdle. What made ex parte McArdle so unique is, Congress went after this Court's appellate jurisdiction, and that alone. What Congress has done here, which is not that unusual, and it's certainly happened several times since McArdle, is that the Court has modified the jurisdiction of all the courts, and that has had the effect of eliminating jurisdiction in this Court over a pending case.
05-184 +++$+++ 39442 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. --
05-184 +++$+++ 39443 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's happened any number of times. The Guagliardo cases that we cite in our brief provide one example. And as Justice Holmes made the point there, it's not a situation where you go after this Court's appellate jurisdiction, as such. There, it's a situation, as Justice Holmes put it, that, when the root is cut, the branches fall; when the district court loses jurisdiction over these cases, then this Court loses jurisdiction. But it's much less of an affront to this Court than the kind of statute that Congress passed in the McArdle situation.
05-184 +++$+++ 39444 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Clement, I, for one, have lost track of your time. I'm interested in your arguments on the -- on the legitimacy and the regularity of these commissions.
05-184 +++$+++ 39445 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if I could talk to various aspects of that, I'm happy --
05-184 +++$+++ 39446 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Can I put the --
05-184 +++$+++ 39447 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- to do so.
05-184 +++$+++ 39448 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that issue in -- don't -- ignore my question, which is the same as Justice Kennedy's, if it doesn't help. I'm trying to focus this. And, in my mind, I take their argument as saying, "Look, you want to try a war crime. You want to say this is a war crimes tribunal. One, this is not a war, at least not an ordinary war. Two, it's not a war crime, because that doesn't fall under international law. And, three, it's not a war crime tribunal or commission, because no emergency, not on the battlefield, civil courts are open, there is no military commander asking for it, it's not in any of those in other respects, like past history. And if the President can do this, well, then he can set up commissions to go to Toledo, and, in Toledo, pick up an alien, and not have any trial at all, except before that special commission." Now, I've tried to summarize a whole bunch of points for you to get at, as you wish.
05-184 +++$+++ 39449 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me try to hit a couple -- [Laughter.]
05-184 +++$+++ 39450 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me try to hit a couple of highlights.
05-184 +++$+++ 39451 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'll be interested in your answer, if you can get it out. [Laughter.]
05-184 +++$+++ 39452 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Let me try to hit a couple of highlights. This is much more of a call for military commissions in a real war than, certainly, the use of military commissions against the Medoc Indians or any number of other instances in which the President has availed himself of this authority in the past. I think the events of 9/11 speak to the fact that this is a war where the laws of war are involved. As to whether or not the law of war encompasses the crime of conspiracy to violate the laws of war, we think that is clearly established. That is something that the United States treated as a valid war crime in the Civil War. That is something that the United States treated as a valid war crime in World War II. I would invite you, as to the former, to look at Winthrop's Treatise, page 839, note 5. He makes it very clear that those conspiracies are not just conspiracies of municipal law, what he called "of the first class," but they included the second class, which are classic war crimes. The most prominent examples are the Lincoln conspirators and a conspiracy at Andersonville Prison to deny POWs their lawful rights. Clearly, those are classic war crimes. In World War II, of course, conspiracy was also charged. And this Court saw it in the Kearing case, although it didn't reach that element of the charge. Now, I think it's very important to understand that history, because the most relevant text on this question is article 21's reference to the law of war. And as this Court was crystal clear in the Madsen case, what that reference is, is Congress's effort, when it extended the jurisdiction of the courts-martials to include more and more crimes, that it didn't want to crowd out the military jurisdiction of the military commissions just because they had concurrent jurisdiction. And this Court, in Madsen, said what Congress authorized was the jurisdiction of the military commissions as it existed in 1916, and then presumably again when it passed article 21 of the UCMJ, the jurisdiction that existed as of 1950. Well, in 1960, you could try conspiracies to violate the law of war. In 1950, you could violate conspiracies to the law of war. So, now let me try to get to the procedures that would be applicable. The argument that's made here is an extraordinary one, that article 36, when it says that military commissions can deviate from the laws of evidence, to the extent the President determines necessary, except that it must apply for the -- comply with the provisions of the UCMJ. Clearly, what that provision means is the provisions of the UCMJ that specifically impose requirements on the military commissions. And there are nine of them. And they impose some -- certain minimum rules. But to say that that provision incorporates all of the UCMJ provisions that put much higher requirements on courts-martials, is to violate this Court's Madsen decision, which clearly recognized that there were differences between court-martials and military commissions. And, although that was an act -- that was a case that addressed the articles of war, article 38 is identical to article 36(a) of the UCMJ, so that's not a difference that matters. And, if I could say, the other thing is, that just violates any normal principle of statutory construction, because then the nine express references to the military commissions are rendered utterly superfluous. Clearly, what Congress had in mind was that, "You must comply with those provisions of the UCMJ that apply specifically to the military commissions." If I could make this point clear, because I think it's helpful in reading the past cases, what made Yamashita and other of the World War II cases so difficult is that the President in that situation constituted commissions that violated even the procedural rules that the articles of war made specifically applicable to the commissions. And so, if you look, for example, at Justice Rutledge's dissent in the Yamashita case, he was at pains to emphasize that very few of the provisions of the articles of war applied to military commissions. And the difficulty was that the -- that the military, in that case, was not complying with even those provisions that specifically applied to military commissions by terms. That's not an issue here. These military commissions comply with all of the provisions of the UCMJ that are specifically addressed to military commissions. So, I just don't think there's a procedural problem here. The import of extending article 2 jurisdiction to new individuals doesn't mean that anything in Yamashita, as to this point, is really no -- is still relevant. What that does is, it takes away the argument -- to the extent that these individuals are within article 2, it takes away the argument that the President doesn't have to even comply with those provisions of the UCMJ that are expressly directed to the military commissions. But that's not an argument we're making here. The argument on the other side of this is really that when Congress specifies that nine rules apply to military commissions, and everything else applies to courts-martials, that somehow all of them have to apply to the military commissions. And as Justice Scalia's question alluded to earlier, in order to accept that argument, you really have to believe that what Congress was doing when it was carefully preserving the military -- the jurisdiction of the military commissions was simply to preserve the option of calling something that had to comply with every single statutory requirement in the court-martials. They got to label it something else. They got to label it a "military commission." Clearly, if you look at the legislative history of Article of War 15 and article 21, as they were developed in the Madsen decision and discussed in the authoritative testimony of General Crowder, that's exactly what wasn't going on. They wanted to make sure that this argument, that as we get more and more things that come within the military jurisdiction of the courts-martials, that somehow we're cutting back on the military commissions. That's not what they wanted. The next thing that may be lurking in the question is the question of, Wwat about the Geneva Conventions? And I think that, very importantly, we have arguments that we have surfaced in our briefs that the Geneva Conventions do not provide relief in these circumstances, that they do not apply, for various reasons. But the first question, at the outset, is whether this Court is going to overrule that portion of Eisentrager that basically said the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable. Now, of course, this Court can say, "That was the '29 Convention, and this is the 1949 Convention." But, as the court of appeals correctly determined --
05-184 +++$+++ 39453 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And there was a footnote dicta.
05-184 +++$+++ 39454 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I don't think it was dicta, Justice Stevens. If there's one thing I think the Eisentrager decision has, it's an awful lot of alternative holdings. And -- [Laughter.]
05-184 +++$+++ 39455 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- Justice Black was concerned about that, and said, "What are you doing reaching the merits when you have, you know, said there's no jurisdiction?" But the Court, as a holding, said that the Geneva Conventions of 1929 did not apply. There aren't any material differences about 1949 Conventions. And I ask you to think about why that makes sense. Because the 1949 Geneva Conventions were being negotiated contemporaneously with this Court's decision in Eisentrager. And even if you think the rule is different today, at that point, Justice Jackson was quite correct that the idea that an enemy combatant would get access to the domestic courts of a detaining power was absolutely absurd. And so, what the -- the framers of the Geneva Convention recognized that they were dealing with a group of people that were uniquely vulnerable. So, they went to great pains to make sure there were mechanisms to enforce their rights. And so, there are various provisions for party-to-party enforcement. There are various provisions for getting the protecting powers, which is now a role basically taken over by the ICRC, to get access to the detainees and to provide other mediating effects. So, what you have is a treaty that's really written against the backdrop, that of course these people aren't going to be able to get to the domestic courts of their detaining -- the detaining power. If you look at the treaty, and read it as a whole, I think it's almost impossible to read it as applying judicially enforceable rights in the domestic courts. The constant --
05-184 +++$+++ 39456 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Does it -- does it -- does it define the contours, along with other relevant international sources, of the meaning of the statutory words "laws of war." He's being charged with a violation of the laws of war in both statutes, like -- what is it? -- 2240 -- 2441, in Quirin. To get the meaning of that term, courts looked to other law.
05-184 +++$+++ 39457 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And, in particular, why isn't he part of the Common Article 3 under the Geneva Convention, as Judge Williams found? That's part of the same question.
05-184 +++$+++ 39458 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, Judge Williams found that, you know, Common Article 3 was applicable here. I don't know why that the Common Article 3, and nothing else would be judicially enforceable. And I don't read his opinion as saying otherwise. I think he still took the view that the entirety of the Geneva Conventions were not judicially enforceable. Now, I take it that the thrust of the question, though, is, don't these Geneva Conventions, even if they're not applicable for one reason or another, don't they form the background of some sort of customary international law that influences what -- how we should interpret the word "law of war" in the statute? And I would say, at a minimum, if there is some role for customary international law here, it has to, consistently with The Paquete Habana case, take into account and give due weight to a controlling executive act. Here, the President has determined, for example, that conspiracy is an actionable violation of the law of war that can be tried in front of these commissions. He's made that clear. He's also made clear that these procedures are sufficient and supply the rights. And so, I think that has to take -- be taken into account into the analysis. I think, also, since article 21 is the most logical place you would -- you would look to any of this as the law of war, I think it's important to understand that I would read that as incorporating some question about what kind of crimes can be brought in this jurisdiction.
05-184 +++$+++ 39459 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Is it the President, and not Congress, defining the content of the law, the criminal law, under which a person will be tried? Isn't there a "separation of powers" problem there?
05-184 +++$+++ 39460 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I sure hope not, Justice Breyer, because that's been the tradition for over 200 years. And article 21 itself makes this clear, because what does it say can be tried by military commission? It says anything that's made a violation of statute or law of war.
05-184 +++$+++ 39461 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I don't --
05-184 +++$+++ 39462 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ So --
05-184 +++$+++ 39463 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- think, Mr. Clement, the 200 years have approved of his adding additional crimes under the law of war. I mean, he has never -- I don't think we have ever held that the President can make something a crime which was not already a crime under the law of war.
05-184 +++$+++ 39464 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that may be true, Justice Stevens --
05-184 +++$+++ 39465 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-184 +++$+++ 39466 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- certainly as to the article --
05-184 +++$+++ 39467 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And one --
05-184 +++$+++ 39468 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- 21 point.
05-184 +++$+++ 39469 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- of the issues is whether he's done that here --
05-184 +++$+++ 39470 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But --
05-184 +++$+++ 39471 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- I think.
05-184 +++$+++ 39472 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But there's no innovation in trying conspiracy as a violation of the law of war.
05-184 +++$+++ 39473 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If you're right on that, you're right on the ultimate question, too.
05-184 +++$+++ 39474 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I hope so, because there's really no question that conspiracy has been charged. And, like you said, I would encourage you to look at footnote 5 on page 839 of the Winthrop Treatise; and this Quirin case had, also, that charge brought before it. Colepaugh against Looney, which is a Tenth Circuit case from World War II, involved the charge of conspiracy. Now, they're going to come up here and tell you, "Well, but that wasn't -- you know, in Colepaugh and Quirin, that wasn't the one that the Court settled on." But that doesn't dispute the fact that that is a crime that has traditionally been charged as a violation of the law of war.
05-184 +++$+++ 39475 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your time is -- why isn't Hamdam a uniquely vulnerable individual that -- you used the phrase "uniquely vulnerable individuals" were involved in another case, but not here. Why not here?
05-184 +++$+++ 39476 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, he's -- I mean, I -- I'm not saying that he isn't somebody who is protected by the laws of war, the customary laws of war. I think that he is protected by those. I don't think he's protected by the Geneva Conventions, but that's largely because he chose not to comply with the basic laws of war. He's obviously --
05-184 +++$+++ 39477 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I thought -- I thought -- I thought you said all prisoners of war were uniquely vulnerable -- I thought that was the point you were making --
05-184 +++$+++ 39478 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That is the point --
05-184 +++$+++ 39479 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and had -- needed --
05-184 +++$+++ 39480 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- that I'm making --
05-184 +++$+++ 39481 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- needed protection of the -- of the supervising powers, or whatever they're called.
05-184 +++$+++ 39482 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ GENERAL CLEMENT +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, but not the domestic courts of the detaining power. And if he's any different than a usual prisoner of war, it's because he's disentitled themselves to some protections by what has been determined by the CSRT protections. Let me just address, if I could, the idea that having provided him with CSRT, we now have to provide him with an article 5 hearing. The CSRT provisions provide all of the protections, and then some, that were normally provided in an article 5 hearing. They were focused on the question that is relevant in this dispute, which is whether or not somebody is an innocent civilian or an unlawful enemy combatant. Nobody has a claim here that they were part of the uniformed al Qaeda division that complied with all of the laws of war, such that they are entitled to POW status. The POW unlawful enemy combatant line is not one that really needs to be policed in this conflict. The serious concern -- and it was his claim when Petitioner walked into Federal Court in Washington -- he said, "I am not an enemy combatant. I did not take up arms against the United States." That's the claim that he brought to the CSRT, the CSRT rejected. For these purposes, at this stage in the litigation, that ought to be enough to allow the proceeding to go forward in front of the military commission. One of the defenses in the military commissions is lawful combatancy immunity. He can make the argument that he wants to make in front of the commissions. If the commission rejects the argument, then there will be review of that decision in the court of appeals on a concrete record. This Court can then address that under 1254. The use of military commissions to try enemy combatants has been part and parcel of the war power for 200 years. Congress recognized it in 1916 in the Articles of War, then again, after World War II, in the UCMJ. This Court recognized it in a host of cases, not just Quirin, but Yamashita, Eisentrager, and, most clearly, in Madsen. Since that is such an important component of the law of war, something that has been part and parcel of that power from Major Andre's capture to today, there is no reason for this Court to depart from that tradition. Thank you.
05-184 +++$+++ 39483 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Katyal.
05-184 +++$+++ 39485 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is a foundational role of this Court, as Justice Kennedy says, to test the lawfulness of tribunals, particularly executive detention. And in the pretrial area, that's the historic role of this Court from Bereford to Quirin. This claim is -- Mr. Hamdan's claim is primarily a jurisdictional one, as both courts below found when they recognized his ability to bring this pretrial challenge, because he is not an offender under the laws of war until he obtains his article 5 hearing, because the charge doesn't state a violation of the laws of war, which is, itself, jurisdictional, and because it doesn't follow the procedures of the laws of war, which this Court, in Yamashita, in pages 5, and, in the dissent, at page 72, recognized as jurisdictional.
05-184 +++$+++ 39486 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't want to --
05-184 +++$+++ 39487 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, that was --
05-184 +++$+++ 39488 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't want to take up from your time, but have you read the footnote that the -- Mr. Clement relies on very heavily?
05-184 +++$+++ 39489 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. KATYAL +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ With respect to conspiracy? Yes, I have. And I do believe the text says that they're referring to domestic offenses. It's certainly the case that conspiracy has been tried as a violation of the laws of war at some point in the Civil War. But that has been entirely eclipsed by the modern laws of war, which have rejected it everywhere. And if you adopt the Government's reading, Justice Stevens, that the laws of war are frozen into time in 1916, then I believe there goes the Government's case entirely, because the thrust of the Government's case is the laws of war have to adapt to this stateless, territoryless organization known as al Qaeda. If we're playing by 1916 rules, there is no way that this commission would have been accepted in 1916. Now, all of those jurisdictional pretrial challenges were accepted by the courts below when the full panoply of DTA rights -- when the full panoply of rights existed. Now the DTA certainly circumscribes the scope. We don't know whether question one very clearly is able to be raised after the DTA's enactment. We certainly -- question two, as the Solicitor General has said, is not raisable. We don't know when it can be raised, because the President can block final review for all time under the DTA. He has the keys to the Federal courthouse. And if you defer to this system and give the President the ability to launch all of these tribunals for 75 individuals with these charges, with these procedures, you will be countenancing a huge expansion of military jurisdiction. Conspiracy is one of the few offenses, Justices, that has now been rejected by the laws of war internationally in tribunal after tribunal. It's certainly never been approved by a Federal Court. And, indeed, it has been rejected. In Colepaugh, for example, no challenge to conspiracy was raised. The Government's argument, in the end, it seems to me, is one that this Court rejected in Loving, because it depends, as its predicate, on the idea that the President has ultimate flexibility with respect to these military commissions, except for the nine provisions in the UCMJ which govern translators and deposition testimony. It is inconceivable that the UCMJ, when enacted, intended to regulate military commissions with only that bare bones to it. Indeed, General Crowder said, "Military commissions and courts-martial follow the same procedures." Finally, Justices, we'd just point out that the predicate of abstention is not met here. This is not a ordinary criminal trial applying lawful ordinary procedures. This is an ad hoc trial in which the procedures are all defined with the President. He says the laws of war do not apply when we're talking about protecting this vulnerable individual at Guantanamo. But then he says they do apply and permit him to charge Mr. Hamdan with the one offense which is rejected entirely at international law. It was a great American patriot, Thomas Paine, who warned, "He who -- that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression, for if he violates that duty, he establishes a precedent that will reach unto himself." That's what we're asking you to do here, just enforce the lawful uses of military commissions and the historic role of this Court. Thank you.
05-184 +++$+++ 39490 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Counsel. The case is submitted.
05-200 +++$+++ 39495 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in 05-200, Empire Healthchoice Assurance v. McVeigh. Mr. Shelley.
05-200 +++$+++ 39497 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Empire's complaint in this case raises a Federal claim. As a result, it arises under Federal law. This case involves fringe benefits for Federal employees provided by the Federal Government. The case involves enforcement of a Federal Government contract. The same contract is rooted in a Federal statute, and the money collected here will go to the Federal Treasury. Nonetheless, the court of appeals held that this case belonged in State court to be governed by State law. The court of appeals should be reversed. In particular, this case concerns the reimbursement of health benefits by a Federal employee to his Federal Government health benefit plan, which is known as the service benefit plan. That plan is governed by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act, FEHBA, and is established through a Federal Government contract. In this case, Empire paid approximately $157,000 in benefits for certain injuries suffered by Joseph McVeigh, but the plan conditioned the payment of those benefits on reimbursement in the event that a recovery was made from a third party. Those terms are part of the Government contract, the reimbursement terms. Thereafter --
05-200 +++$+++ 39498 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Can you go back and because the -- the parties seem to have different views about it? I think you said it was required by OPM to have this reimbursement term, and the other side said that there was no requirement from the Government agency that you include the reimbursement term.
05-200 +++$+++ 39499 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under the statute -- Justice Ginsburg, under the statute, the Office of Personnel Management is charged with selecting the benefits and exclusions for this particular program and for this particular plan. The statutory section is 8902(d). And those terms are -- OPM has the final authority over those terms and those terms are placed in a statement of benefits which the -- which this statute also says shall become part of the contract and are attached and incorporated into the contract. So the final authority over the benefits and the exclusions --
05-200 +++$+++ 39500 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that -- all that says is that OPM looked at these terms and it thought they were okay. It's not -- it doesn't show that OPM required these -- this as a condition for Empire to serve as the insurer.
05-200 +++$+++ 39501 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's -- our obligations are through the contract, and our only obligations here are the ones in the contract. And that contract -- that provision is in the contract. And as a result of that, we were -- we were mandated to enforce that provision. If the Government wanted that provision out, it had the final authority to take it out, and it would only have been included if, as a matter of authorization, OPM wanted it in there.
05-200 +++$+++ 39502 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that's different from putting it in. I mean, you want to change what you -- what you allege, that -- that it's mandated by the Government to simply the Government, although it had authority to eliminate it, did not do so? If -- you know, that's a different -- different assertion.
05-200 +++$+++ 39503 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The -- I think it makes no difference. The fact of the reality is that it's in the contract.
05-200 +++$+++ 39504 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'll assume it's the latter then.
05-200 +++$+++ 39505 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The reality is that the -- these reimbursement terms are in all the contracts essentially of the FEHBA carriers, and as a result, I think it can be assumed that it's the policy of the Government that they should be in here. And the result of them is that they save the Government money. So it does make good Government policy to have these provisions in -- in the contracts to begin with.
05-200 +++$+++ 39506 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But this is a fairly indirect way of establishing a Federal cause of action. I mean, it -- it's a preemption provision. Why isn't it reasonable to assume Congress thought there was no need for a Federal cause of action? Because it's a contract action. State courts handle those every day, and they assumed they'd be handled by State court.
05-200 +++$+++ 39507 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think the Court's decision in Jackson Transit sets up the framework for that, and that is, that Congress did assume there would be a contract cause of action, but --
05-200 +++$+++ 39508 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I noticed you referred in your brief to the Jackson Transit line of authority. Do you know how many times Jackson Transit has been cited in the last 20 years by this Court?
05-200 +++$+++ 39509 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It has not been applied again since then, but we would say it's settled law as a result.
05-200 +++$+++ 39510 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's not been cited. I think it's never been applied and it's not been cited once in 20 years. So what's the line of authority?
05-200 +++$+++ 39511 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's four or five cases that Jackson Transit was built on, for instance, the Machinists case v. Central Airlines, which came out of the 1960's. In those cases, for instance, they -- the principle is simple and it's a strong one, and that is that Congress assumes that a -- when it calls for the creation of a -- a contract in a statute, that it will be enforceable just as with ordinary contracts.
05-200 +++$+++ 39512 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Those cases came from the days when we were also quite willing to imply Federal causes of action in statutes that had nothing to do with the Government, you know, 10b-5 and things of that sort. I thought we had put all of that behind us. You want us to go back to that bygone age.
05-200 +++$+++ 39513 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I don't think so, Justice Scalia. The -- the Court in Jackson Transit specifically differentiated between Congress assuming there was a contract cause of action whenever it calls for the creation of a contract and separately implying a cause of action. That's different because that -- that has to -- in doing that, the Court has to create a cause of action in the first place, but Congress is assumed to want contracts to be enforceable when it calls for the creation of the contracts in a Federal statute.
05-200 +++$+++ 39514 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We're not talking about the contract between you and the Federal Government. We're talking about some other agreement between you and an individual employee.
05-200 +++$+++ 39515 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. We're talking about the contract between us and the Government because it's that contract that contains the reimbursement terms, and when the enrollee enrolls in the Federal program, he or she takes on the obligation of complying with all the terms of the Government contract.
05-200 +++$+++ 39516 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that may give rise to a separate agreement, a related agreement, if you will, between you and the employee. But it's not -- it's not a -- you're not the Government. The employee is not the Government, at least not for these purposes. So why is it a Government contract?
05-200 +++$+++ 39517 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Because the -- the underlying terms are part of the Government contract and --
05-200 +++$+++ 39518 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So if the Government says -- Congress says, we think OPM should have a recreation center for its employees and it should have all these things, and then OPM enters into a contract with a company that runs recreation centers -- okay -- that's a contract with the Government. And then that entity enters into a contract with somebody else to supply the basketball hoops. Would you say that that last contract is a Government contract?
05-200 +++$+++ 39519 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The subcontract?
05-200 +++$+++ 39520 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-200 +++$+++ 39521 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I would not say it's a contract with the Government, and that's not our situation.
05-200 +++$+++ 39522 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Even if the provision -- even if at some point Congress said, and besides, you know, the basketball hoops should be -- you know, made in America as opposed to somewhere else and, you know, specifies the terms of the subcontract.
05-200 +++$+++ 39523 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's not a Government contract. The Government contract is the contract between the party with the Government, and that's what we have here and that's what we're seeking to enforce. But I would point out that cases like Jackson Transit and the Central Airlines case -- the case -- the party suing wasn't really suing on the contract even. It was -- the case emanated from the contract, and as a result, the Court, nonetheless, held it arose under Federal -- Federal law. In this case, the -- the case is directly on the contract itself. So it's a much closer connection to the Government terms. Under the --
05-200 +++$+++ 39524 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But there's nothing in the statute that speaks about a Federal forum. And if you look at this entire picture, you're seeking reimbursement, and you're seeking reimbursement based on a tort recovery. And why wouldn't the most sensible, the most natural thing for a legislature, if they thought about it, be to say, well, that claim for reimbursement ought to come in on the coattails of the tort claim? You don't need to make a whole separate Federal case out -- out of it. Why would Congress want these claims to be subject to a separate Federal case?
05-200 +++$+++ 39525 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Justice Ginsburg, every other type of claim under this program is in Federal court already, denials of benefits cases, disputes between the carrier and the United States. Only a sliver of lawsuits, these reimbursement suits, are -- are left. And it would be anomalous to -- for Congress to have wanted those to be in State court. But even aside from that, a Federal forum offers the --
05-200 +++$+++ 39526 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it's because there's an anterior lawsuit that everything rides on that State court suit. There wouldn't be any recovery from which you could claim reimbursement were it not for that State court lawsuit.
05-200 +++$+++ 39527 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The reality is that a straightforward Federal lawsuit and a Federal rule that these -- these reimbursement provisions are straightforwardly enforceable through Federal claims means that they will -- the reimbursement will be collected efficiently and correctly.
05-200 +++$+++ 39528 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Could you -- following up on Justice Ginsburg's question, could you intervene asserting rights of subrogation in the underlying tort suit that your covered beneficiary brought in State court?
05-200 +++$+++ 39529 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Conceivably, but the Federal question statute allows us to raise Federal claims in Federal court, and through it, Congress has determined that if the case turns on Federal law, that the Federal forum is an appropriate forum for that.
05-200 +++$+++ 39530 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, wouldn't it be more efficient for you to intervene in the pending State suit and get it all resolved at once rather than waiting until your beneficiary gets a recovery and then starting a whole other Federal suit over this somewhat subsidiary subrogation point?
05-200 +++$+++ 39531 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, because in many States -- many States don't allow reimbursement altogether. They have anti-subrogation policies as well, and the reality is, is that what --
05-200 +++$+++ 39532 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, at that point, you'd be able to assert your argument under the Federal preemption provision that says, in my view somewhat surprisingly, that these contract terms preempt State law.
05-200 +++$+++ 39533 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, and we've fought many battles on those fronts in the State courts. And the reality is that the Federal forum with its familiarity with Federal law, its solicitude towards Federal law is the appropriate forum in these cases, more so than the State court. And what may seem like an efficient --
05-200 +++$+++ 39534 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You don't have any such problem here. There's no conflict between the New York law -- you certainly could have gone into that lawsuit and --
05-200 +++$+++ 39535 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, no conflict is required, for instance, under the Jackson Transit analysis. The analysis is, is this a pervasively Federal regime to start with, and if so, it's a Federal claim whether there's a conflict or not. And so a conflict is really unnecessary. But the other point is that with the --
05-200 +++$+++ 39536 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I could see if this were -- what we were talking about everything is -- the insurance of a Federal employee and questions about coverage, questions about benefits, all of that between the employee and the carrier. But this comes up because we have a third party who enters the picture in an estate law claim. So I don't think you can just say, well, everything is -- this whole thing is -- is all a Federal contract.
05-200 +++$+++ 39537 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, there is no -- there's no requirement in the preemption provision either for a conflict. I mean, Congress went back to the -- to the drafting table in 1998 and said, we want State law to be preempted whether or not there's a conflict in this particular situation. So --
05-200 +++$+++ 39538 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That would have been a good time for them to say we want a Federal -- Federal court jurisdiction over these causes of actions if that's what they had in mind, but they didn't do that.
05-200 +++$+++ 39539 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, first of all, there have -- there was no dispute whatsoever that these types of cases could be brought in Federal court in 1998.
05-200 +++$+++ 39540 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Oh, there sure was. For those who like to look at the legislative history, the House report said that -- again, it's very curious language. It said, this change will help strengthen the case in favor of Federal jurisdiction, or something like that.
05-200 +++$+++ 39541 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Mr. Chief Justice --
05-200 +++$+++ 39542 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, since when is Congress trying to strengthen -- they either decide it's going to be Federal jurisdiction or not. They don't try to make arguments.
05-200 +++$+++ 39543 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There had been no dispute about whether reimbursement claims could be brought in Federal court. The courts -- the courts were in agreement on that. What there was a dispute about was whether denials of benefits cases could be removed from State court to Federal court. And what Congress did was it followed the ERISA model and changed the preemption provision because the preemption provision was what had been giving the courts problems about the removal issue. And so Congress did, I think, what the courts told it to do, was get rid of some language in the preemption provision that is hampering Federal jurisdiction. Congress did that and created Federal jurisdiction. Nonetheless, now we come up with a new dispute that had never been a problem before --
05-200 +++$+++ 39544 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's sort of queer terminology anyway. When Congress has already decided that there should be Federal jurisdiction. It would seem very strange for Congress to say this strengthens the case for Federal -- what do you mean the case for Federal jurisdiction?
05-200 +++$+++ 39545 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think --
05-200 +++$+++ 39546 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ We prescribe Federal jurisdiction. I -- you know, I'm not a fan of legislative history, but I -- I don't find that particular piece very much against you. In fact, it may be just -- just the opposite. It may be -- it's lawyers' language, you know. We don't know whether there's Federal jurisdiction or not, but this will make a better case for -- you know, for the other side.
05-200 +++$+++ 39547 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think Congress enacted the statute in 1995 against the backdrop of -- of settled law that Federal programs are typically litigated in Federal court. What happened, though, was that the States started -- started enacting provisions in the area and Congress went to work in 1978 and enacted a preemption provision to reemphasize what I -- what it believed in the first instance. Then in 1998, after courts continued even to interpret the preemption provision narrowly, they went back to the -- they went back to the -- to the statute and they strengthened it even further to make it absolutely clear. So I think what we have is a --
05-200 +++$+++ 39548 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I thought that the -- the purpose of the preemption provision in this statute was related to benefits and coverage. Some States have mandatory coverage for this or that. The case that was mentioned is the chiropractor. And the -- in the Federal scheme, the Federal administrator didn't want to be saddled with whatever the particular packages that the States had. So the coverage and the benefits -- those were to be determined on the Federal level, and you weren't supposed to be saddled with whatever the State thought would be good to have in the plan.
05-200 +++$+++ 39549 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But the provision doesn't read simply that State laws defining benefits shall be preempted. It reads State laws relating to the extent of coverage or the nature or provision of coverage, benefits, or payments with respect to benefits. And so it covers a broad array of things other than simply mandated benefit statutes.
05-200 +++$+++ 39550 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is --
05-200 +++$+++ 39551 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, but -- but -- I'm sorry.
05-200 +++$+++ 39552 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is there any comparable situation where a contract between two private parties has the effect of preempting State law? Suppose all you have to do in your service benefit plan is agree with your beneficiaries that in the case of subrogation, you're entitled to, you know, 10 times actual damages, if they don't pay up right away or something like that. And -- and that would override all sorts of State law. You could specify you're entitled to interest at 20 percent and that would preempt State usury laws?
05-200 +++$+++ 39553 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I believe there are many other statutes in the benefits area involving the Federal Government from long-term care to miliary benefits which have a similar preemption provision. I think it --
05-200 +++$+++ 39554 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's a sloppy way to put it, don't you think? Maybe what Congress should have said, although Congress doesn't always speak precisely, is that any -- any State law which contradicts a provision of the contract on these particular subjects is preempted.
05-200 +++$+++ 39555 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It said that originally, and the courts interpreted that so narrowly that Congress took that out. Took the contradiction part out. There was an inconsistency requirement in the statute. Congress took it out specifically to knock out even supplementary or --
05-200 +++$+++ 39556 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay, I'll put it differently. All State laws relating to subjects that are covered in the contract are preempted.
05-200 +++$+++ 39557 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I would say that that's -- that Congress, when it enacted the provision, I think intended something on those lines. The provision is, in fact, the result of several different amendments and it reads the way it does as a result of the amendments. And if I could reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal, Mr. Chief Justice.
05-200 +++$+++ 39558 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, counsel. Mr. Srinivasan.
05-200 +++$+++ 39560 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: An action to enforce the terms of a FEHBA contract is a Federal action because the rights and duties in FEHBA contracts are Federal in nature under the Jackson Transit inquiry. The Federal nature of the rights and duties comes both from the context in which FEHBA operates and also from the terms of the express preemption provision. Briefly --
05-200 +++$+++ 39561 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't there -- isn't that a big leap? I mean, even if we agree with you that there are Federal rights and duties, is it irrational for Congress to determine, since they arise in a normal breach of contract action, we're going to assume they're going to be brought in State court? The cause of action is for breach of contract that every State recognizes.
05-200 +++$+++ 39562 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I guess that seems like an unlikely outcome, given that under the express terms of the preemption provision, it's clear that the contract terms are matters of Federal law in the sense that Federal law dictates that they govern over State law. And if we know that Federal law provides a substantive rule of decision with respect to the construction of the contract, it seems anomalous to impute to Congress the intention that those Federal rights and duties should be litigated solely in a State court action.
05-200 +++$+++ 39563 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But wouldn't it have been the easiest thing for Congress to say, as it does countless times when it creates Federal rights, that Federal courts have jurisdiction to enforce these rights? And they didn't do that here.
05-200 +++$+++ 39564 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, they didn't do that, but I think as Jackson Transit explains, it's -- it's different in the contract context than in your standard implied cause of action context for the following reason. When Congress specifically contemplates the construction of contracts, as it did in FEHBA, it clearly contemplates that those contracts will be enforceable somewhere. So there is a cause of action for breach. The only question is whether that cause of action sounds in State law or instead in Federal law. And on that question, when Congress prescribes, as it did in the preemption provision, that the rights and duties are matters of Federal law, it seems most likely that Congress intended there would be a Federal cause of action that could be brought in Federal court to litigate those terms. And that's what Congress did in the terms of the preemption provision. That --
05-200 +++$+++ 39565 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What -- you -- you might follow along with that perfectly well if you're talking about the beneficiary, the Federal employee, saying I'm entitled to a certain coverage or I'm entitled to certain benefits. You would expect that suit to be in Federal court. But why would you expect what piece of the tort recovery the carrier will get to be in Federal court?
05-200 +++$+++ 39566 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, this is part and parcel of benefits, Justice Ginsburg, because you're right that when -- and when an employee asks for benefits, you'd expect that issue to be litigated in Federal court. But this is a condition on benefits. That's how the reimbursement obligation is framed in the contract. It's that if you get benefits from the Federal Government and then later on get the same benefits from a third party, a condition on the Government benefits is at that point you have to reimburse the Federal Treasury. So I don't think that one can easily draw a distinction between benefits qua benefits and benefits that are at -- at one point issued to the employee but then are subsequently returned pursuant to the terms of the reimbursement obligation.
05-200 +++$+++ 39567 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Suppose there's a dispute in the -- in the lawsuit about whether a particular benefit to which one - the party was entitled under the contract has been waived. Okay? That's the issue. Is that issue to be decided by Federal law or by State law?
05-200 +++$+++ 39568 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, do you mean in an underlying tort action or --
05-200 +++$+++ 39569 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-200 +++$+++ 39570 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No. In the underlying tort action, that generally would be governed by State law. Now, on the question of whether a benefit is something that the individual is entitled to or, conversely, whether the benefit is obligated to -- whether the individual is obligated to --
05-200 +++$+++ 39571 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I'm not talking about the -- I'm talking about the claim, the claim made by an individual against the carrier. And -- and it is asserted that this claim should have been made sooner. It has been waived by not having been brought forward sooner. Okay? That's -- that's the hypothetical. Do -- do you think that that -- that is governed by Federal law?
05-200 +++$+++ 39572 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm not sure --
05-200 +++$+++ 39573 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Whether waiver occurred or not.
05-200 +++$+++ 39574 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I think that -- that when it's a claim for benefits, it probably would be governed by Federal law.
05-200 +++$+++ 39575 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Why?
05-200 +++$+++ 39576 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But even --
05-200 +++$+++ 39577 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I mean, the text -- the text only -- only says, shall -- which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits. Extent of coverage or benefits. I don't know that that relates to any of them. It relates to whether the benefit that was covered has been waived.
05-200 +++$+++ 39578 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it depends on whether the contract speaks to the issue. Now, insofar as the contract --
05-200 +++$+++ 39579 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-200 +++$+++ 39580 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- insofar --
05-200 +++$+++ 39581 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It doesn't speak to it.
05-200 +++$+++ 39582 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- insofar as the contract doesn't speak to an issue, there obviously would be a stronger argument for the operation of State law. But that's not --
05-200 +++$+++ 39583 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. So you're not saying that -- that Federal law is -- is pervasive here, that it covers the -- the entire -- the entire suit between the claimant and the insurer.
05-200 +++$+++ 39584 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not necessarily.
05-200 +++$+++ 39585 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay. In that respect, doesn't it differ from ERISA?
05-200 +++$+++ 39586 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, it -- it differs from ERISA in the following sense, that in ERISA, ERISA sets forth a cause of action. And so the Court has concluded that that cause of action is exclusive of State court causes of action. And we're not taking that position here. We -- we don't say that the Federal action is the only action -- excuse me -- that's available. State court actions for breach of contract might also be available. But --
05-200 +++$+++ 39587 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, you're gong to make a lot of trouble for us. We're going to have to sort out which of these things are covered by State law and which aren't.
05-200 +++$+++ 39588 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I don't know that it's going to be a -- a terribly difficult inquiry because of the precision with which the terms of the preemption provision speaks. And it's certainly not difficult with respect to the reimbursement obligation because it fits --
05-200 +++$+++ 39589 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, ERISA has a very clear preemption provision too, and that's generated a fair amount of work for us.
05-200 +++$+++ 39590 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It has, but in terms of -- in terms of the relate-to requirement, that's true, and I think the Court would apply exactly the same standards that it applies in ERISA.
05-200 +++$+++ 39591 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Do you think there's any constitutional difficulty with the preemption provision in this statute?
05-200 +++$+++ 39592 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't. I think --
05-200 +++$+++ 39593 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You can make a contract preempt State law. Is there any precedent for that?
05-200 +++$+++ 39594 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think Boyle somewhat stands for the same proposition in this --
05-200 +++$+++ 39595 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You don't have Boyle for that.
05-200 +++$+++ 39596 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm sorry?
05-200 +++$+++ 39597 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I didn't think Boyle went that far.
05-200 +++$+++ 39598 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Boyle at least establishes that the terms of a contract preempted State law because it was a procurement contract and the idea was that by complying with the terms of the procurement contract, the contractor asserted essentially a federally compelled defense to the State court action.
05-200 +++$+++ 39599 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I thought -- I thought it defined a duty. I -- I agree with Justice Stevens. I -- I've never seen it -- are there other statutes where the contracting parties can decide whether or not they're going to oust Federal law -- or State law?
05-200 +++$+++ 39600 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't know that there are other statutes, but what this particular -- particular provision indicates is that Congress thought it was very important that FEHBA contracts would control over State law, and I don't think there's any constitutional limitation on Congress' ability to do that. After all --
05-200 +++$+++ 39601 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I -- I wrote Boyle and what I thought I was saying was that the common -- (Laughter.)
05-200 +++$+++ 39602 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- was that the common law, Federal common law precluded, preempted any State law which contradicted this contract. Now, you can -- you can put that in a sloppy fashion by saying that the contract preempted State law, but it wasn't --
05-200 +++$+++ 39603 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But --
05-200 +++$+++ 39604 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that we thought it was the contract that preempted State law. It was Federal common law which said that the contract -- that any provision in State law which contradicts the contract is preempted by Federal common law. And you can read this statute the same way. It's a sloppy way of putting it, but what it means is Federal law preempts any State provision that is contrary to a provision of the contract --
05-200 +++$+++ 39605 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That -- that --
05-200 +++$+++ 39606 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- which -- which is certainly constitutional.
05-200 +++$+++ 39607 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely that's constitutional, and that's -- that's what I mean to be saying because it's Federal law --
05-200 +++$+++ 39608 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Congress isn't always precise, is it?
05-200 +++$+++ 39609 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, they're not.
05-200 +++$+++ 39610 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is there any significant variation among the different carriers as to the terms of the contracts they use in different places for Federal employees?
05-200 +++$+++ 39611 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ On which particular --
05-200 +++$+++ 39612 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under this program.
05-200 +++$+++ 39613 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ There's -- there's variation, sure. Now, on -- on --
05-200 +++$+++ 39614 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Is there a lot or a little?
05-200 +++$+++ 39615 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, there's -- it depends on what you're talking about.
05-200 +++$+++ 39616 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What I'm thinking of is a statute. The statute has fairly close detail as to what the contracts must contain. It gives authority to OMB or -- to write regs. And they have written regs that have very detailed provisions as to what the contracts must contain, and then there is the contract with the individual carried -- when the -- when the carrier is implementing these rules, regulations, and statutes.
05-200 +++$+++ 39617 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
05-200 +++$+++ 39618 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I'm trying to figure out is --
05-200 +++$+++ 39619 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The statute doesn't give a great deal of specific --
05-200 +++$+++ 39620 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It gives some.
05-200 +++$+++ 39621 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- direction on the terminology.
05-200 +++$+++ 39622 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It gives some.
05-200 +++$+++ 39623 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It gives some, but it's only bare bones, Justice Breyer.
05-200 +++$+++ 39624 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, I know, but I'm trying --
05-200 +++$+++ 39625 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But I think that's important because what -- what Congress has done is essentially to leave it to OPM to negotiate the terms of these contracts.
05-200 +++$+++ 39626 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Insofar as the individual carriers write contracts with their covered employees, i.e., me and you and other people, and there's a lot of variation, I would say there's a lot of private going on. But insofar as those contracts are dictated by what OPM says, then it looks more to me like a regular Federal program.
05-200 +++$+++ 39627 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, those --
05-200 +++$+++ 39628 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And I'm trying to get a handle on that.
05-200 +++$+++ 39629 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The contracts between the individual and the carrier are dictated by OPM in some sense because OPM negotiates the terms that bind the individual. So, the contract that you and I enter into when we sign on for health insurance is a part of the -- of the program, if you will, that's negotiated by OPM with the carrier.
05-200 +++$+++ 39630 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So in other words, when I sign a contract, or anyone who's a Federal employee, it's OPM who effectively sets those terms?
05-200 +++$+++ 39631 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's right, in negotiation with the carrier, and the statement of benefits is essentially the program. It tells you what benefits you're entitled to and it tells you what obligations you're encumbered by when you take on those benefits. And one of the obligations that you're encumbered by under the clear terms of this contract is the obligation to reimburse the carrier in the event --
05-200 +++$+++ 39632 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I understand.
05-200 +++$+++ 39633 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SRINIVASAN +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- that you receive benefits and then subsequently receive benefits from a third party. And one thing that I don't want to lose sight of is that ultimately this concerns money that will be reimbursed to the Federal Treasury. And so the fact that this case happens to involve litigation between two private parties shouldn't obscure the strength of the Government's interest in the area, given that Federal funds are involved.
05-200 +++$+++ 39634 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Srinivasan. Mr. Stock.
05-200 +++$+++ 39636 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court: I must confess that I continue to be perplexed by the claim that Congress intended reimbursement claims of this type to be handled and -- and to be dealt with in the Federal courts when that same Congress, in enacting the FEHBA statute, did not provide for that cause of action or that right in the first instance.
05-200 +++$+++ 39637 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It's quite possible no one in Congress thought about this --
05-200 +++$+++ 39638 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it --
05-200 +++$+++ 39639 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- which is common. So if it is common, why is it that we would not use the same approach that the Court used in Clearfield Trust, in Kimbell Foods, and really look to the nature of the contract? Whereas here, the rights at stake are really those of the United States in that they are going to get the money. We have a statute. We have all those things I just listed. It covers only Federal employees. Should -- there are strong interests in uniformity throughout the Nation, et cetera, et cetera. So what is the difference between this case, other than a technical difference? I concede that one. The title is not United States. It's Blue Cross Blue Shield or whatever.
05-200 +++$+++ 39640 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No.
05-200 +++$+++ 39641 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Empire, et cetera. But aside from that, why is it different?
05-200 +++$+++ 39642 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because, Your Honor, in the first instance, number one, uniformity really is not a -- a legitimate claim in this -- in this instance by Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
05-200 +++$+++ 39643 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Why -- why?
05-200 +++$+++ 39644 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Because --
05-200 +++$+++ 39645 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The obvious reason for uniformity would be you are a Federal employee, whether you're in Alaska or whether you're in Virginia.
05-200 +++$+++ 39646 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor.
05-200 +++$+++ 39647 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it's unreasonable to think Congress would want the rights of those different Federal employees to differ just because of where they live. And so what's the answer to that?
05-200 +++$+++ 39648 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- the fact of the matter is, is the way Blue Cross has written this reimbursement provision, they will differ. The reimbursement provision, which -- by the way, to start with, the reimbursement provision that is in the Blue Cross Blue -- Blue Cross Blue Shield contract with the employees is different than the reimbursement provisions which are described in the contract between OPM and Blue Cross Blue Shield. It is markedly different in several ways, the first way being that, with respect to procurement costs and the issue of this $157,000, who pays to obtain that. In the OPM Blue Cross Blue Shield contract, it provides for attorney's fees and disbursements to be paid by the Government and the -- and the claim -- the reimbursement claim to be reduced by that. In the Blue Cross Blue Shield version of that between Blue Cross Blue Shield and the -- the litigant here, that provision is changed. And this is why I say they then undercut their own claim for uniformity. They basically say that we'll allow you attorney's fees if we feel like it in a particular case. That's not a uniformity provision.
05-200 +++$+++ 39649 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, you're saying that there is a uniformity between a master contract between the United States and Blue Cross on the one hand, and Blue Cross and the subscriber on the other hand. But doesn't the United States approve the latter contract? In other words, doesn't it -- well, I forget the initials -- OPM or whatever it is. Doesn't it have a -- a requirement of approval going to the terms of the contract between Empire and -- and the employee before that contract goes into effect?
05-200 +++$+++ 39650 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not sure what the mechanics are of it, Your Honor.
05-200 +++$+++ 39651 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But isn't that -- isn't that crucial, though, in your answer to Justice Breyer? Because if the United States -- if OPM approves the Empire employee contract, maybe you can say, well, gee, there's something strange going on at OPM that they don't require exactly the same terms in the contract with the employee that they -- that they require in their master contract with -- with Empire. But it doesn't say anything one way or the other about the interest of the United States in having uniformity in which the -- in the -- in the interpretation and application of contracts, which they do approve, between Empire, other Blue Cross Blue Shield entities, and their employees.
05-200 +++$+++ 39652 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I think when we're talking about uniformity, Your Honor, because this is a statute designed to benefit Federal employees, that we're talking about uniformity in the context of all Federal employees are treated the same. The provision that Blue Cross Blue --
05-200 +++$+++ 39653 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And the United States is treated the same in relation to all Federal employees. I mean, there's -- there's an interest in uniformity for fairness among employees, and there's an interest in the United States in having the same expectation, in this case a reimbursement expectation, no matter where the employee is.
05-200 +++$+++ 39654 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct. But in -- in terms of uniformity, the provision that Blue Cross -- several provisions that Blue Cross Blue Shield has added to this reimbursement clause undercut the uniformity aspect of it. And when you say in a particular case, we'll decide, well, the fellow from Alaska -- we'll give him his attorney's fees and disbursements, but the fellow from New York, we won't give it to, you undercut any -- any --
05-200 +++$+++ 39655 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's uniform in both Alaska and New York, they are subject to the -- to the Blue Cross waiver of attorney's fees or not. They're being treated uniformly. I don't see that that's disuniform. What is disuniform, it seems to me, is that you have an employee who wins a judgment in Alaska and he gets to keep all his money because Alaska law says the reimbursement provision is -- is invalid, and then you have a Federal employee in Texas who -- who gets a -- wins the same tort lawsuit, and he has to turn over to Blue Cross all the -- the portion of his recovery that would cover the outlay that Blue Cross has made. That's disuniformity.
05-200 +++$+++ 39656 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the uniformity which we're seeking, relative to these benefits, and the -- and the argument as to uniformity I would submit to you, at least as to how we treat the Federal employees, is illusory in this case because no matter how this Court decides in this particular case, whether there's Federal jurisdiction here or not, the employees are being treated differently State to State based upon the provision that Blue Cross Blue Shield has enacted.
05-200 +++$+++ 39657 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I suppose that the preemption provision would apply equally if this were brought in State court or Federal court. Correct?
05-200 +++$+++ 39658 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-200 +++$+++ 39659 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I'm curious --
05-200 +++$+++ 39660 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your -- your answer to -- to Justice Scalia -- I'm sorry -- just did not register. I don't understand --
05-200 +++$+++ 39661 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it was incomplete, Your Honor, because I -- I had turned around to answer the Chief Justice. The -- the way they have this set up with the right of reimbursement and the -- and the kickers that Blue Cross Blue Shield puts in the statement of benefits creates a situation. They -- they add that these rights of reimbursement apply no matter how the cause of action for damages is delineated, in other words, whether it's seeking damages for medical benefits or damages for pain and suffering. And what Blue Cross Blue Shield has introduced is that -- that kicker. And -- and what that does, in effect, from State to State is change the outcome for the employee because, for instance, in New York where we have a collateral source rule by statute that says, you may not prove medical damages in a personal injury case for which you've collected insurance. So, for instance, in Denise McVeigh's case, I can't prove her medical bills. Yet, Blue Cross Blue Shield is going to come in and pick Denise Finn's pocket on her claim for pain and suffering for the $157,000 in medical bills that they say they've paid. Whereas, if I go across the river -- and I don't know the law in New Jersey, but assuming that New Jersey uses the older rule where, if I had the good sense to buy myself medical insurance and I collected medical insurance for the benefits that were -- if I collect the medical payments for the medical bills, I can still go into court and prove those medical bills as against the tortfeasor. In that particular instance, Blue Cross Blue Shield comes in and it takes money at least that I've gotten from the other side as opposed to in New York where they take money that I haven't gotten from the other side.
05-200 +++$+++ 39662 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but do they take money in New York that you haven't gotten from the other side?
05-200 +++$+++ 39663 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Absolutely. They're looking to assert a claim. I don't have a claim for medical benefits in the underlying court --
05-200 +++$+++ 39664 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but there's uniformity because the Government wins in both cases.
05-200 +++$+++ 39665 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry, Your Honor?
05-200 +++$+++ 39666 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There's uniformity because the Government wins in both cases. (Laughter.)
05-200 +++$+++ 39667 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I have to concede that that's true, and if that is the uniformity that we seek and the only --
05-200 +++$+++ 39668 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I mean, that's the kind of uniformity the Government loves.
05-200 +++$+++ 39669 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sure they do. (Laughter.)
05-200 +++$+++ 39670 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I wasn't thinking of that kind of uniformity. (Laughter.)
05-200 +++$+++ 39671 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I assure you, Your Honor, that Denise Finn doesn't.
05-200 +++$+++ 39672 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I was thinking of the contract -- the contracts that the carriers enter into with the individual Federal employees in different places. And I'm trying to get an idea of whether those contracts all read the same or they don't. And so far, you have found one example of where they read differently. Some contracts apparently say when you reimburse us, you can subtract attorney's fees, and others say when you reimburse us maybe you can subtract attorney's fees, depending on how we feel about it. And I grant you that is a difference. And I am curious, as was Justice Souter, as to whether you have to get OPM approval for that difference or whether OPM can tell you, knock it off, we want the same. And also I'd like other examples. What I'm trying to do, to be clear about it, is I'm trying to see how similar this is to the instance of the Federal employee checks, which this Court many, many years ago said, when you pay your Federal employees and you write a check, it's Federal law that's going to govern the interpretation of the endorsement. I want to see how similar it is and how different. I have two differences. One is the name on this case is Empire, not United States, and the second difference is the one you just mentioned about may rather than must. Now, are there others?
05-200 +++$+++ 39673 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There are differences in my understanding, Your Honor, from State to State between the different Blue Cross entities. I couldn't tell you what exactly those differences are, but my understanding is that these Blue Cross policies vary from State to State. Do they vary -- I -- I think, Your Honor, although it supports my contention, that you may have misunderstood what I said about the -- the difference between the reimbursement clauses, honestly. What I -- what I indicated was the -- the reimbursement clause that is in the OPM/Blue Cross contract is different from what Blue Cross then enters into with its members. That differs. I was not asserting that it differs from State to State. What I'm saying is that the effect of that differs from State to State certainly.
05-200 +++$+++ 39674 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ May -- may I ask this? Because I think your example overlooks the fact that at least your opponent claims that the Blue Cross contract provision would preempt the New York law that denies your client recovery for health benefits.
05-200 +++$+++ 39675 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It does --
05-200 +++$+++ 39676 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think that would be their answer to your example.
05-200 +++$+++ 39677 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it would be in error, I believe, Your Honor.
05-200 +++$+++ 39678 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, if we -- if we think Congress can provide that a contract provision would preempt a State law, it seems to me the example you've given is the precise example that that statute was intended to cover.
05-200 +++$+++ 39679 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- at the -- at the very essence of that, I don't believe that a contract can preempt State law. The constitutional laws of the United States can preempt State law. If somehow you can bootstrap a contract into that by some theory, I suppose you could argue that it -- that it --
05-200 +++$+++ 39680 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if -- if it does, it would eliminate the lack of uniformity on which you rely.
05-200 +++$+++ 39681 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It -- it would not, Your Honor, in this instance because the -- the operation of that statute does not affect their right to reimbursement under their contract provision. It affects the --
05-200 +++$+++ 39682 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, but it affects the amount that your client can recover. And they would say that they -- because it assumes an absence of -- it assumes a payment by the carrier, and under -- I -- I think they would take the position that they have, in fact, the -- they have not, in fact, paid that insurance cost.
05-200 +++$+++ 39683 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Your Honor, I don't think we would ever --
05-200 +++$+++ 39684 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm not stating it very well, but I --
05-200 +++$+++ 39685 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The -- the situation with the -- the term of New York law that I am -- that I had indicated would occur during a trial of the case and in terms of my cause of action. It would not affect Blue Cross' lawsuit against my client.
05-200 +++$+++ 39686 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No. But the defendant would say, we don't have to pay those damages because they're covered by insurance. And the response would be, well, they're not -- they -- they are only covered by insurance if they can be reimbursed. I don't want to take up too much of your time on this.
05-200 +++$+++ 39687 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, they wouldn't be a party to that suit at that time, though, Your Honor, in -- in terms of raising that issue.
05-200 +++$+++ 39688 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But -- but the preemption provision, at least with respect to the rights of Empire, would ensure uniformity. In other words, if the contract terms preempt State law, then any impediment to recovery by Empire that varies from State to State would be overridden.
05-200 +++$+++ 39689 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Right, but that wouldn't affect -- that wouldn't override the net -- the net effect on the -- on the person. The -- the real world effect on Denise Finn and other people like her would still be different.
05-200 +++$+++ 39690 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, I understand that. But to the extent people are concerned about disuniformity from the point of view of the Federal recovery, the preemption provision is going to apply whether this action is in State court or Federal court.
05-200 +++$+++ 39691 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's correct.
05-200 +++$+++ 39692 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What's your --
05-200 +++$+++ 39693 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And if the only -- if the only interest in uniformity we have, again, is whether the -- whether the Federal Government gets its -- its money back, then -- you know, then the uniformity argument may fly. But if we're also interested in the -- in the uniformity argument in the manner in which Federal employees are treated and in the manner in which ladies who -- such as Denise Finn are treated, then uniformity is -- is out the window under these -- under this --
05-200 +++$+++ 39694 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But the only question that we're considering today is whether or not Federal question jurisdiction exists to authorize bringing this suit in Federal court.
05-200 +++$+++ 39695 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And I would submit to Your Honor it clearly does not because this case, involving Blue Cross suing Denise Finn for these benefits involves not issues of the construction or interpretation of a Federal statute, but issue -- the issues involved in our case are whether they're entitled to collect the money that they paid three times to the same doctor for the same service on the same day. They paid a particular Dr. Brown $17,500 for the same service on three occasions. In addition, our dispute involves whether or not some of the benefits that they claim they paid and which were medically a result of this accident were in fact or whether they were taking other benefits they paid and trying to be a little cute and collect those under saxony. Those are the issues. Those issues --
05-200 +++$+++ 39696 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I would have thought the issue is whether Federal law governs this --
05-200 +++$+++ 39697 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, yes, but --
05-200 +++$+++ 39698 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- and they come to Federal court. So what is clearly -- maybe I -- maybe you've -- I don't think you've said this. We know this. That if the United States issues checks to all of its employees throughout the country and then it seeks to recover from one of the drawees or one of the people who endorsed the check on the ground it was fraudulent, we know that it is Federal law that must govern those checks. Right? From Clearfield.
05-200 +++$+++ 39699 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, which --
05-200 +++$+++ 39700 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ All right. Now, what is the difference in this case? In this case, we have a private administrator of this Federal -- of this -- of this Federal program. There are Federal employees throughout the country. They are supposed to receive uniform -- reasonably uniform health insurance, and the private administrator wants to obtain money that it thinks it's entitled to to put into the Federal Treasury. Now, aside from the name, what's the difference?
05-200 +++$+++ 39701 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The difference is, is in the instance of Clearfield Trust, you had the Government involved in a dispute over their own commercial paper that they issued and a uniquely Federal interest and a uniquely Federal item. Here, these -- Federal employees aren't the only employees in America who get health benefits, and they are -- these disputes that arise under this statute are most frequently not of the -- not seeking to answer the grand questions. They're most frequently involved in dealing with issues such as we have here. Whether the --
05-200 +++$+++ 39702 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the Federal Government were running this program itself, would you make the same argument?
05-200 +++$+++ 39703 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry, Your Honor. I missed the first --
05-200 +++$+++ 39704 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE ALITO +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If the Federal Government were running the program itself, rather than having it -- private entities administer the program for it, would you make the same argument?
05-200 +++$+++ 39705 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't know that I would, but I think the caveat to that is if the Federal Government were running it themselves, pursuant to a different statute than we have here, the first thing I think I would look at is what jurisdiction or what the Congress had to say about where they wanted cases arising from that. It may well be --
05-200 +++$+++ 39706 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, they've already said that. I mean, there would be Federal jurisdiction there because the Federal Government would be a party to the case. Right?
05-200 +++$+++ 39707 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor. But they're not a party to this case.
05-200 +++$+++ 39708 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's exactly what I'm trying to find out. That's -- that's what I'm -- I'm trying to figure out in my mind how close this is to the Federal Government running a uniform program. I mean, everybody agrees Federal law governs questions involving the rights of the United States --
05-200 +++$+++ 39709 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-200 +++$+++ 39710 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- arising under nationwide Federal programs. And here, we have not the United States. We have Empire. And so how close is Empire to being simply an instrument of the United States in this respect, and how close is it to being really an independent company that sets up its own insurance contracts? That's what I'm trying --
05-200 +++$+++ 39711 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Interestingly enough, the Government has told us that. And what they told us -- and it's at page 4 of -- and in a footnote number 3 from the amicus curiae's briefs from Cruz. And the Government has told us in Cruz's pending certiorari petition that that -- Blue Cross Blue Shield carriers do not perform outsourced Government tasks, are not agents of the Government, and do not act on behalf of OPM. Rather, they function as independent economic entities that offer and run their own health insurance plans, performing a role that is not governmental in nature.
05-200 +++$+++ 39712 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's quite good. What are you reading from?
05-200 +++$+++ 39713 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I'm sorry, Your Honor?
05-200 +++$+++ 39714 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What are you reading from there?
05-200 +++$+++ 39715 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ We're reading from the footnote number 3 of the amicus curiae's brief at -- at page 4.

This is the Department of Justice's concession that Blue Cross has sole authority over reimbursement decisions, and that is their language. That's the way they describe --
05-200 +++$+++ 39722 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But at the end of the day, the money, every penny collected, minus any service fee, is going to go into the Federal Treasury. Isn't it?
05-200 +++$+++ 39723 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ That's true.
05-200 +++$+++ 39724 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Of course, you could say the same about -- about any recovery, that a certain percentage in taxes will go to the Federal Treasury I -- I --
05-200 +++$+++ 39725 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, we can also say -- we can also say that irrespective of whether the Federal courts collect it or the State courts collect it, it's still going to end up in the Federal Treasury, and that these are --
05-200 +++$+++ 39726 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But whether it's collected or not may -- indeed, may vary depending on whether State law or Federal law applies. And if Federal law applies, then you have the jurisdictional consequence.
05-200 +++$+++ 39727 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The problem in this case, in terms of asserting arising-under jurisdiction, is -- and -- and in terms of Boyle also, is that the -- the Petitioner has failed to point out any difference in how it would occur. There is absolutely no difference pointed out by the Petitioner as to how the law would differ --
05-200 +++$+++ 39728 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, presumably it didn't do that because the preemption provision does not rely upon conflict.
05-200 +++$+++ 39729 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ The preemption provision doesn't apply to reimbursement provisions either, Your Honor. It applies to --
05-200 +++$+++ 39730 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, it doesn't apply to reimbursement provisions, you say, but it does apply to benefits. And -- and the value of a benefit is going to vary from the -- the policy limit to zero depending, in a case like this, on whether a third party payment has to be given to the Government with -- with -- isn't -- isn't that a question of benefit?
05-200 +++$+++ 39731 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, it is not, Your Honor. And with all due respect, this Court has consistently held that words used in one place in the statute should mean the same thing as in other places in the statute. Coverage and benefits, as it's defined in this statute, does not include reimbursement claims, and to stretch that preemption clause --
05-200 +++$+++ 39732 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Will you quote the language that you're referring to?
05-200 +++$+++ 39733 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ If I can find it, Your Honor, sure. I'm sorry, Your Honor.
05-200 +++$+++ 39734 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I -- I don't want to take up too --
05-200 +++$+++ 39735 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'm flipping around. I have it here.
05-200 +++$+++ 39736 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ My -- my concern simply is that you've made a conclusory statement that elsewhere there's a definition that doesn't --
05-200 +++$+++ 39737 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ There is.
05-200 +++$+++ 39738 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And -- and --
05-200 +++$+++ 39739 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ And it's --
05-200 +++$+++ 39740 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ After the argument, just give me a cite so I know exactly what you're -- you're getting at.
05-200 +++$+++ 39741 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No problem, Your Honor. The -- the punch line to it is or to paraphrase it, you know, benefits are described as payments for medical -- medical payments for this, that kind of thing. But there is a very specific description of what benefits means in the plan. It doesn't include reimbursement. And I -- and I think it really stretches it to include reimbursement as a -- under that benefit setting.
05-200 +++$+++ 39742 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But how do you answer the question that I think Justice Breyer was -- was getting at, that it's -- it's a -- the -- what's in it for the carrier? Nothing. As -- if -- if every penny that the carrier collects is going to go into the U.S. Treasury, then why does the carrier care?
05-200 +++$+++ 39743 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Being a cynic, I'm not so sure of that, Judge. But -- Your Honor. I'm sorry. I'm not so sure of that because early on in the -- in Blue Cross Blue Shield's summary of the facts, they indicate that Blue Cross' fees in the matter are determined based upon performance. I don't know what performance means, but I suspect it has something to do with how much money ultimately ends up being spent. I don't think it's necessarily relevant to the inquiry that we're involved in. The fact that -- that all of the money may ultimately go to the Government, though, I don't think changes the issue as to whether or not this Court should confer subject matter jurisdiction upon the district courts in this case. There -- the -- the issues here can be resolved in the State courts and more efficiently than in the Federal courts. And certainly I think that the Federal courts would not look forward to an influx of cases dealing with issues in -- in essentially personal injury issues involving whether or not particular doctors were paid properly, whether or not particular payments need to be made in connection with and are reimbursable to the Government, or the types of issues that we have here. And to be perfectly honest, most of the cases are not of the magnitude of this one where we're talking about $150,000. Most of the cases involve $5,500 and $6,500 and things like that. The Government --
05-200 +++$+++ 39744 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, but this is a claim for $150,000 out of a settlement of $3 million or $4 million.
05-200 +++$+++ 39745 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-200 +++$+++ 39746 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ What was your defense on the merits?
05-200 +++$+++ 39747 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ To this claim?
05-200 +++$+++ 39748 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-200 +++$+++ 39749 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Our defense on the merits to this claim, were we to get there, is that the Government has paid the same doctor $17,500 three times for the same service, and that Denise Finn should not be required to reimburse Blue Cross Blue Shield when they have incompetently, in effect, paid out more money than they should have. The second defense involves the fact that some of the benefits which Blue Cross Blue Shield is seeking reimbursement for are not connected to the accident that injured Mr. McVeigh. They're part of his normal health care type of services which wouldn't fall under the reimbursement claim. Those claims are -- are not the type of things that I think that the Federal district courts want to deal with. This case --
05-200 +++$+++ 39750 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I take it you're not foreclosed from making your defense or your claim in the Federal court.
05-200 +++$+++ 39751 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ No, absolutely not. But --
05-200 +++$+++ 39752 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Mr. -- Mr. Stock, we have one loose end. I think we do. Both Justice Breyer and I have -- have asked the question whether OPM has to approve of the terms of the contract between Blue Cross and -- and the -- the insured. Is -- does OPM have to approve?
05-200 +++$+++ 39753 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I don't believe they do, Your Honor. I think the terms of OPM and Blue Cross' contract provide that Blue Cross will enter into a -- a contract with the -- with the policyholders that is consistent with its contract with OPM. But I don't -- I don't believe -- and -- and honestly, I -- I did not look before we -- we talked about this. I don't believe it requires their approval. They don't get a copy of the contract and read it over.
05-200 +++$+++ 39754 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Assuming the consistency term, that supports an argument that the Government has an interest in -- in uniformity of -- of interpretation, doesn't it?
05-200 +++$+++ 39755 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Only if the -- if in uniformity of interpretation of the contract?
05-200 +++$+++ 39756 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, yes.
05-200 +++$+++ 39757 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ I think the Government has an interest in uniformity of the manner in which the -- the employees are ultimately treated, and I think when we talk about uniformity, that that's what we ought be talking about.
05-200 +++$+++ 39758 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Well, I guess you can be -- depending upon how detailed the OPM contract is, you can be consistent with that contract and still have an enormous amount of variation from one to another. It depends entirely upon whether the OPM contract is entirely comprehensive. If it covers every jot and tittle, then I guess you can't be consistent with it and different. But if it's -- if it's sort of bare bones, you -- you could be consistent with that and have a lot of variation, couldn't you?
05-200 +++$+++ 39759 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes, absolutely. And -- and my understanding is that -- is for that reason that OPM does not review the contracts and approve the contract language of Blue Cross Blue Shield.
05-200 +++$+++ 39760 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But if -- if --
05-200 +++$+++ 39761 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ But I don't know that.
05-200 +++$+++ 39762 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ -- if, in fact, there were consistently only in this remote sense so that the interests which are meant to be protected in the -- in the OPM Blue Cross contract aren't being protected at the next level, then OPM could bring an action against -- against Blue Cross saying it's not consistent enough, couldn't it?
05-200 +++$+++ 39763 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It could.
05-200 +++$+++ 39764 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Yes.
05-200 +++$+++ 39765 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. STOCK +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ It could. But in this particular instance, the contract provisions that Blue Cross are -- and Blue Shield are seeking to enforce, as regards reimbursement, are markedly different. I mean, it's -- it's not a small variation. It's a very substantial matter in terms of, first, the procurement costs and, second, in terms of what kind of a cause of action Blue Cross Blue Shield can take the money from. But that's not an -- an incidental. That goes to the heart of -- of the matter. If there's no other questions, Your Honors, thank you.
05-200 +++$+++ 39766 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ Thank you very much, Mr. Stock. Mr. Shelley, you have 4 minutes remaining.
05-200 +++$+++ 39768 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
05-200 +++$+++ 39769 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I wonder if you could focus on one question for me. If you have a State law cause of action and the law to be applied to some aspects of that cause of action is Federal law, is that sufficient to establish Federal question jurisdiction or not?
05-200 +++$+++ 39770 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It is, Your Honor, under the Grable case that the Court issued last year. A State law claim that turns on the construction of Federal law, a substantial question of Federal law, is removable to Federal court and arises under Federal law in the first place. I wanted to address Justice Souter's question of whether OPM does approve the contract. There's no individual contract -- excuse me -- between Blue Cross and any individual enrollee. The statement of benefits is part of the Government contract. It is attached at appendix A and the terms of the contract, the master contract, specifically say that in sections 2.2 and 2.5, that the benefits shall be -- and -- and reimbursement terms as well -- shall be consistent with and incorporated by the statement of benefits, which is attached. And so it is part of the contract. There's no separate contract here. It's one --
05-200 +++$+++ 39771 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You mean everybody in the entire United States gets the same piece of paper.
05-200 +++$+++ 39772 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The same brochure.
05-200 +++$+++ 39773 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So it's identical. There is no difference between every individual's contract, every Federal employee's -- I guess it's a contract with the Federal employee. Isn't it? I mean, he's bound by it you say.
05-200 +++$+++ 39774 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ They -- by enrolling, they bind themselves to the contract.
05-200 +++$+++ 39775 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ All right. So I am -- in Alaska, Virginia, everywhere, they get the same piece of paper. They enroll and then they're bound by it.
05-200 +++$+++ 39776 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Absolutely.
05-200 +++$+++ 39777 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the question here is whether that should get different interpretations possibly in different places.
05-200 +++$+++ 39778 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Under State law, and it should not. And we are -- it is a uniform system across the country, and the -- the carrier is bound to apply those terms, particularly the reimbursement terms, consistently and equitably across the country.
05-200 +++$+++ 39779 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Counsel --
05-200 +++$+++ 39780 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Section 4.1 of the contract says that.
05-200 +++$+++ 39781 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- the -- the Grable case said, though, that the Federal question had to be a necessary element of the State law cause of action. That's not always the case in these cases, is it?
05-200 +++$+++ 39782 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well --
05-200 +++$+++ 39783 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's only -- the -- the Federal question comes up only on issues of preemption. They may or may not be presented in a particular case.
05-200 +++$+++ 39784 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ In the first instance, our claim is an enforcement claim for the contract. The contract itself and the common law that surrounds it are -- are Federal law, and as a result, we --
05-200 +++$+++ 39785 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that kind of -- that begs the -- that's not the question I asked and it sort of begs the question. I mean, you have the State law cause of action to enforce your contract claim, and if there's some State law that's asserted against you that's inconsistent with the contract, then you have the Federal question issue. But that's the only Federal question I see in the case.
05-200 +++$+++ 39786 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, but there are, for instance, seven States that wouldn't allow us to bring the cause of action in the first place, and that's why we need to go back to the question of whether the claim itself is Federal in nature. And under the Jackson Transit or Clearfield Trust analogies, the law at the start, the cause of action, the claim itself is Federal in nature, and you don't need to get to the question of whether the vessel of a State law claim --
05-200 +++$+++ 39787 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ My hypothetical that I started with was assuming you have a State law claim, a State law cause of action. So do you have any authority other than Grable for the proposition that a State law cause of action which -- in which the law to apply may or may not turn on Federal law in particular aspects presents a Federal question?
05-200 +++$+++ 39788 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SHELLEY +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the contract itself is Federal law. It -- it is a -- it is tantamount to a regulation that the Government has selected the terms of, and as a result, it should be treated as Federal law. And -- and cases, Franchise Tax Board, on which -- on which Grable relies and the earlier cases -- we -- we would say those reach a similar result. One other point I wanted to address was this issue of whether this attorney's fees question is different than the master contract or the statement of benefits. It's not. The master contract addresses the question of whether we can deduct our own attorney's fees from the recovery before we give the money to the Federal Treasury. The statement of benefits governs the question of whether we -- we will deduct for attorney's fees when we collect the claim from the subscriber.
05-200 +++$+++ 39789 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Thank you very much, Mr. Shelley. The case is submitted.
05-204 +++$+++ 39793 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++  +++$+++ We'll hear argument next in No. 05-204, League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Smith.
05-204 +++$+++ 39795 +++$+++ FALSE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Texas legislature passed a new congressional districting map in 2003 for only one reason: maximizing the number of Republicans who would represent the State of Texas in Congress. Even though the existing lawful map already had 20 of 32 districts which strongly favored the Republicans, lawmakers went to extraordinary lengths to lock in control of 22 districts, moving around 8 million people into new districts, abandoning concerns about compactness, wherever necessary, and most importantly, segregating the population by race and by politics into 32 districts which are extremely noncompetitive.
05-204 +++$+++ 39796 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So your -- your statement that it was for one reason only means it wasn't for any discriminatory reason on the grounds of race or ethnicity?
05-204 +++$+++ 39797 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, the finding of the district court, which we're relying on here, was that it was purely for discrimination based on partisanship rather than on the basis of race. Now, they started out by trying to engineer the defeat in the -- in the legislative process, engineer the defeat of the six Democratic Congressmen who had managed to be elected in Republican-leaning districts because they were moderate to conservative and they were, as the district court put it, able to appeal to voters to split their tickets and vote for them in 2002. By the end of the legislative process, they went further and decided to take the risk of eliminating one of only four districts in the State in which African Americans had an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice and also to eliminate one of the Hispanic opportunity districts in south Texas. Now, in the latter case, they did try to replace that with another Hispanic opportunity district, but that was the one that we've called the land bridge district, District 25, which spans 300 miles, linking up urban concentrations of Latinos in Austin and in McAllen down on the Mexican border.
05-204 +++$+++ 39798 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You think that's no good.
05-204 +++$+++ 39799 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, we --
05-204 +++$+++ 39800 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Not -- not even to prevent retrogression, which would violate section 5.
05-204 +++$+++ 39801 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, the retrogression problem was created by the fact that they had gotten rid of a much more natural -- naturally occurring --
05-204 +++$+++ 39802 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But that was done for political reasons, not racial reasons.
05-204 +++$+++ 39803 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Exactly, Your Honor, and that's the argument that was made and rejected expressly by this Court in Bush v. Vera, that we had to make an ugly minority district rather than a compact minority district because if we did it the other way, a nearby incumbent would lose his seat. That was precisely the argument that was made there, that it was really incumbency protection, and we had to make it this ugly district to send that excessive racial message in order to protect other nearby incumbents, an argument which is mirrored here exactly and -- and as to which I notice the -- the State of Texas offers no response.
05-204 +++$+++ 39804 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what -- what is your proposal? What -- what is -- what is a State to do if -- assuming there is a political motivation in drawing its districts, perfectly valid political motivation let's assume, and the result of that redrawing is that it would eliminate a majority minority district, what -- what is the State supposed to do?
05-204 +++$+++ 39805 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think the State has to stay within the constitutional confines of the Shaw v. Reno doctrine which would require it not to go so far in the pursuit of its political agenda that it creates a district -- has to -- has to create a minority opportunity district somewhere that would otherwise violate Shaw. Now --
05-204 +++$+++ 39806 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But what's the -- I'm -- as Justice Scalia, I'm interested in the section 25 problem. The briefs --
05-204 +++$+++ 39807 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ District.
05-204 +++$+++ 39808 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- for your co-counsel don't talk much about it, and it's -- it's a problem for me. Justice Scalia's point was let's assume -- and I have some doubt about it. Let's assume that there's a valid reason for redoing section 23. That means you need another district to avoid retrogression. What is -- what is your position as to district 25 on that assumption, based on that assumption?
05-204 +++$+++ 39809 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I don't think that it makes a constitutional difference under this Court's cases whether or not the reason they decided to place the district there and give it that configuration was because they had a political agenda somewhere else. The -- the fact of the matter is they -- they were deliberately trying to create an Hispanic majority district there, and to do it, they had to go all the way up to Austin and grab 300,000 Latinos and link them up with --
05-204 +++$+++ 39810 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Surely, that's not what makes it bad. Even if they created a compact district but with the -- with the intent of creating a majority minority district, that would be a district created for a racial reason. The mere fact that this one happens to be not compact doesn't eliminate the motivation, and -- and I don't see how you can avoid that motivation unless you're going to abandon the -- the prohibition against regression.
05-204 +++$+++ 39811 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our point, Your Honor, is that in this situation, doing it this way, the -- the motivation predominates over the other legitimate districting criteria, which I think under Bush and under --
05-204 +++$+++ 39812 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which -- which motivation?
05-204 +++$+++ 39813 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, the -- the racial motivation to create a district -- to -- to reach out as far as they did to capture --
05-204 +++$+++ 39814 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, can the -- can the State by its action with one district, i.e., 23, in effect bootstrap itself in a position where it's entitled to use race where -- in a -- in a predominant and I -- I think insulting way and -- and then have a defense?
05-204 +++$+++ 39815 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Our submission is that they cannot, Your Honor. Now, if I could turn to the partisanship issue, our --
05-204 +++$+++ 39816 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I just clarify one thing on that?
05-204 +++$+++ 39817 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Sure.
05-204 +++$+++ 39818 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I take it your reason was that in Bush v. Vera, the Court said, of course, they can use race to prevent retrogression. Of course, they can, but if they do, they have to create a compact majority minority district, not an elongated majority --
05-204 +++$+++ 39819 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes.
05-204 +++$+++ 39820 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE BREYER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's the -- that's the argument. I have to go back and look at Bush v. Vera.
05-204 +++$+++ 39821 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor, and that they can't say we have to create it in a non-compact way where the race predominates over the other values because we have a political agenda of protecting some other incumbent in a non-minority district.
05-204 +++$+++ 39822 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ How -- how does that make any sense to say that what you're objecting to is the consideration of race in one situation, but if it's compact and the predominant motive was the consideration of race, that doesn't bother you? That seems to me to be a back-door way to get into a more extensive judicial review of the compactness and based on racial considerations that are, under your view, the predominant factor in each case.
05-204 +++$+++ 39823 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, Your Honor, I think there's a question of what you mean by the word predominance. And I as understand the Court's cases, there are times when the shape and the extra efforts that are made to -- to kind of gather up minority voters as, for example, in Miller v. Johnson where we had a very similar district, where race is said to predominate in a different sense than it does when you simply are creating a minority district to avoid retrogression or to -- to stay in compliance with the Voting Rights Act. Clearly, the Voting Rights Act requires you to create minority districts. It should require that it makes sense that people make efforts to do that. We're not saying you shouldn't do any of those things. We're just saying in this instance, under this Court's cases, you shouldn't be able to use your political agenda to allow you and justify you to do it in a different way which sends this extra message of excessive racial consideration.
05-204 +++$+++ 39824 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And that's a --
05-204 +++$+++ 39825 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ So you can take race into account if it's compact as a predominant motive. You can't take race into account if it's not compact.
05-204 +++$+++ 39826 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I think, Your Honor, you certainly can --
05-204 +++$+++ 39827 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ As a dominant motive.
05-204 +++$+++ 39828 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ You certainly can intentionally create a minority district under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. I don't know how you could comply with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act if you don't do that in situations where, under the Gingles criteria, that's what you're supposed to do.
05-204 +++$+++ 39829 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ May I ask? I'm a little puzzled by the -- the questioning. Doesn't everyone agree that the predominant motive in all the districts was political? You agree to that, don't you?
05-204 +++$+++ 39830 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Yes, Your Honor.
05-204 +++$+++ 39831 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And you don't agree that that necessarily makes it valid, that that's necessarily a defense to section 2.
05-204 +++$+++ 39832 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, I actually don't agree with that, Your Honor, and you're right.
05-204 +++$+++ 39833 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And -- and the problem with section -- with district 23, under section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, is not the motivation. It's the results that have changed. Isn't that correct?
05-204 +++$+++ 39834 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor.
05-204 +++$+++ 39835 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE STEVENS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ And the question under the district court's opinion is whether the political motive was an adequate defense to what would otherwise be a violation of section 2. Is that correct?
05-204 +++$+++ 39836 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor.
05-204 +++$+++ 39837 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, isn't it correct, though, that a result is -- focus on results is not sufficient if the challenge is an equal protection one and not a section 2 one?
05-204 +++$+++ 39838 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Right, but -- but our challenge under the Equal Protection Clause --
05-204 +++$+++ 39839 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ I'm talking about district 25.
05-204 +++$+++ 39840 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It's a little hard to keep all the different arguments straight, but yes. Our argument is based on intent there, yes, Your Honor. And -- and the argument is that the intent went too far because they had to --
05-204 +++$+++ 39841 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, that's why I asked earlier that your -- your statement that all of this was done with a political motive -- I wondered how that satisfied the equal protection requirement, not the section 2 requirement.
05-204 +++$+++ 39842 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Well, I think there are situations in which you have a political motive overarching the entire map, and that -- but at the same time, that pushes you to do some things which could violate the Fourteenth Amendment in terms of racial conduct. And that's what this -- that's what our argument is --
05-204 +++$+++ 39843 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE KENNEDY +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ But you don't think that's a defense. It seems to me the State creates the very problem that it claims that it must use race to settle.
05-204 +++$+++ 39844 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ That's correct, Your Honor, yes. We don't think it's a defense in this instance.
05-204 +++$+++ 39845 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Now, with respect to section 2, what is -- what is your position on the relationship between the predominant political motivation and the existence and nonexistence of a section 2 violation?
05-204 +++$+++ 39846 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, if I understand the question, I -- if the question is is it permissible to have --
05-204 +++$+++ 39847 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If -- let me put it another way.
05-204 +++$+++ 39848 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Okay.
05-204 +++$+++ 39849 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ If -- if you otherwise demonstrate a section 2 violation, is the political motivation a defense?
05-204 +++$+++ 39850 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No, Your Honor.
05-204 +++$+++ 39851 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SOUTER +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ No.
05-204 +++$+++ 39852 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Certainly not. Now, we have a -- an argument about that too, which has to do with the district in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and I think the political defense there doesn't have anything to do with it. Now, if -- if I could, I think that the whole map -- the decision to redraw the whole map violates the Equal Protection Clause for a wholly different reason, which was that it was wholly lacking in any rational, legitimate public purpose. At the time, there was a lawful map in place that had the right number of districts, and the district court found as fact that the only reason that this law was even considered, let alone passed, was to help one political party gain more seats in the Congress at the expense of the other.
05-204 +++$+++ 39853 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What about having a --
05-204 +++$+++ 39854 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Wow. That's a surprise. (Laughter.)
05-204 +++$+++ 39855 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ What about having a -- a plan that was put in place by the legislature instead of a temporary plan put in effect by a court?
05-204 +++$+++ 39856 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ The --
05-204 +++$+++ 39857 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE GINSBURG +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Isn't there -- isn't it -- you -- you seem to treat this as a redone redistricting instead of as the very first redistricting done by a legislature.
05-204 +++$+++ 39858 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ It was the first one done by the legislature because they violated the Constitution intentionally when they had an obligation to -- to draw a map 2 years earlier. Our submission is that the existence of some power that the legislature may have to -- to alter the remedial map -- and they may well have that power. We don't -- we don't question that -- doesn't justify the map. They still have to, in exercising that power, point to some constitutional basis for which they're acting.
05-204 +++$+++ 39859 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Which -- but it's a perfectly constitutional basis to alter the map because we don't think it allocates the seats in the fashion that our political power enables us to -- to provide for. Legislatures redraw the maps all the time for political reasons. I mean, to say that this is, you know, something horrible is ridiculous. You acknowledge that political motivation is fine.
05-204 +++$+++ 39860 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Your Honor, we --
05-204 +++$+++ 39861 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ JUSTICE SCALIA +++$+++ JUSTICE +++$+++ RESPONDENT +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ Don't you?
05-204 +++$+++ 39862 +++$+++ TRUE +++$+++ MR. SMITH +++$+++ NOT JUSTICE +++$+++ NA +++$+++ PETITIONER +++$+++ -- we acknowledge that we tolerate political motivation in the context of map-drawing when there's other legitimate public purposes being served, which is to say at the beginning of the decade when they have to redraw the map anyway.
